It followed that Newton's law of gravitation would have to be replaced with another law, compatible with the principle of relativity, while still obtaining the Newtonian limit for circumstances where relativistic effects are negligible. Such attempts were made by Henri Poincaré (1905), Hermann Minkowski (1907) and Arnold Sommerfeld (1910). In 1907 Einstein came to the conclusion that to achieve this a successor to special relativity was needed. From 1907 to 1915, Einstein worked towards a new theory, using his equivalence principle as a key concept to guide his way. According \n\n for stained-glass windows have discoveries of physicists Pieter Zeeman and Hendrik Lorentz as a subject. One of these stained-glass windows contained a portrait of Hendrik Lorentz and formulas devised by him that describe the behavior of electrons. Other stained-glass windows show the instruments to measure the splitting of spectral lines of atoms under the influence of a magnetic field is measured, the so-called Zeeman effect. He also made portraits of the physicists Albert Einstein and Paul Ehrenfest. Kamerlingh Onnes' work was included in the 1939 exhibition and sale Onze Kunst van Heden (Our Art of Today) at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. In 1953 Kamerlingh Onnes with Bert Nienhuis Piet Wiegman, Dirk Hubers and Frans Wildenhain, took part of the exhibition \"five contemporary potters\" in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, which was one of the first museum presentations of modern artisan ceramics in the Netherlands.\n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz made significant contributions to both physics and society. In the field of physics, Lorentz played a crucial role in the development of the classical theory of electromagnetism. Together with James Clerk Maxwell, Lorentz formulated the electron theory, which provided electromagnetism with its final form. This theory, often referred to as the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, explained phenomena such as the Zeeman effect, which gave the first indication of the existence of electrons.\n\nLorentz's groundbreaking work also included the establishment of the Lorentz transformation in 1904. This transformation preceded Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity and laid the foundation for it. Lorentz's contributions to theoretical physics were recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902.\n\nOutside of his scientific achievements, Lorentz made important contributions to society. He played an influential role in promoting the new developments in physics through his involvement in the Solvay conferences as the chairman. These conferences brought together leading physicists to discuss and advance the field.\n\nFurthermore, Lorentz held important positions nationally and internationally. He chaired the Zuiderzee committee at the national level, contributing to the management and protection of the Zuiderzee, a former inlet of the North Sea in the Netherlands. Internationally, Lorentz served as the president of the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. His leadership in this role helped foster intellectual collaboration between nations.\n\nLorentz's unique greatness was widely recognized, and he was greatly respected by his peers. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of all time, expressed that Lorentz meant more to him personally than anyone else he had met in his life.\n\nIn summary, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz's contributions to physics include the development of the electron theory, the explanation of the Zeeman effect, and the establishment of the Lorentz transformation. In society, he played a prominent role in advancing physics through the Solvay conferences and held important positions both nationally and internationally. His impact on both fields was widely recognized and admired.\n\n Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 , which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the \n\n The Nobel Prize in Physics (Nobelpriset i fysik) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists who have made outstanding contributions in Physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes which were established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Every year, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences sends out forms, which amount to a personal and exclusive invitation, to about three thousand selected individuals to invite them to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize.

This version is Deadpool's roommate whom he met through an ad placed on Craigslist, a decision Al mournfully regrets midway through the film. Not much is known about this version of Al, only that she has a known affinity for cocaine and has spent time with Wade at the local laundromat helping him get blood stains out of an early version of his uniform.  Al and Wade have a bizarrely romantic quasi-relationship exemplified in their shared obsession with IKEA furniture, which Wade insists the blind lady assemble by herself without his help. His pranks are also on show, when he claims to have hidden a large stash of cocaine and \"the cure for blindness\" somewhere in the duplex. ; Uggams reprises the role in Deadpool 2. Deadpool returns to the apartment they shared after the death of his fiancé Vanessa. Al offers her condolences but encourages him to not let Vanessa's death stop him from living the rest of his life. Later, after getting ripped in half by the Juggernaut, Deadpool recovers at Al's apartment, which serves as the location where he teams up with Cable. \n\n success of the critically lauded Deadpool, a film adaptation of a relatively minor Marvel Comics character that premiered at over $100 million in February, a time of year generally considered poor for movie audience interest. It was an observation further confirmed in 2018 when Black Panther was an even grander success with a $235 million debut in the same time of year, and later became the first superhero film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Avengers: Endgame became the highest-grossing film of all time. In 2017, the film Sign Gene featured about deaf superheroes who use sign language.\n\n The first three X-Men films and Deadpool set opening records in North America: X-Men had the highest July opening yet, while X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand earned the fourth-highest opening weekends yet and Deadpool got the largest opening weekend in February. The records for the first three films have since been surpassed. The next three X-Men films after X-Men: The Last Stand opened lower than their predecessor and didn't set opening records. In North America, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series, and it also has the highest opening weekend. Outside North America, X-Men: Days of Future Past has the highest opening weekend and is the highest-grossing film in the series. Worldwide, Deadpool was the highest-grossing film in the series and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, before being surpassed on both records by its sequel. The X-Men film series is the second highest-grossing film series based on Marvel Comics characters after the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In North America, it is the fifth-highest-grossing film series, having earned over $2.4billion. Worldwide, it is the eighth-highest-grossing film series of all time, having grossed over $6billion.\n\n X-Men is an American superhero film series based on the fictional superhero team of the same name, who originally appeared in a series of comic books created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and published by Marvel Comics. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the characters in 1994, and after numerous drafts, Bryan Singer was hired to direct the first film, released in 2000, and its sequel, X2 (2003), while the third installment of the original trilogy, X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), was directed by Brett Ratner. After each film outgrossed its predecessor, several spin-off films were released, including three Wolverine films (2009–2017), four X-Men prequel films (2011–2019), and two Deadpool films (2016–2018), with The New Mutants concluding the series in 2020, after a 20-year-long run. With thirteen films released, the X-Men film series is the eighth-highest-grossing film series, having grossed over $6billion worldwide. In March 2019, Marvel Studios obtained the film rights to X-Men after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox. In October 2020, the films in the X-Men series, along with the Fantastic Four films, were rebranded as Marvel Legacy movies on Disney+.\n\n 20 million, so it's trying to fit that financial model into the sequel model so it makes sense for the studio and being able to pay the actors what they now get paid and deserve to get paid.

It is a subsidiary of Airline Transport Communications Incorporated. The station features primarily Christian religious programming. WWRB is unusual among shortwave broadcast stations in that it does not utilize radio airtime brokers for selling airtime, instead preferring to directly rent time to clients. WWRB uses four 100 kW to 150 kW transmitters and six antennas to provide their services to regions of the world specifically requested by broadcasters. At this time, not all of their antennas appear to be in use. WWRB operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, changing frequencies as shortwave propagation changes to maintain their target reception areas. Their main targeted services are titled Global-I through Global-IV.\n\n FEBC operates its shortwave broadcasts in different languages, transmitting from its facilities in Bocaue, Bulacan.\n\nShort-wave Radio ; Short-wave (or Amateur) radio is a relatively long range method of communicating using radio waves. Because of the nature of radio wave propagation, communications made via short-wave radio can be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment and knowledge. However, due to their reliance only on electrical power (which can be obtained via batteries, solar, and other alternative means) and Earth's ionosphere, they are ideal for some of the worst case emergency scenarios. One disadvantage may be that one requires training and licensing to transmit using a short-wave radio, in many countries. ; Two-way Radio ; Two-way radio consists of at least two devices (typically portable and hand-held) that are capable of transmitting and receiving communications to each \n\n The Marine Radiotelephone Service or HF ship-to-shore operates on shortwave radio frequencies, using single-sideband modulation. The usual method is that a ship calls a shore station, and the shore station's marine operator connects the caller to the public switched telephone network. This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet. Short wave radio is used because it bounces between the ionosphere and the ground, giving a modest 1,000 watt transmitter (the standard power) a worldwide range. Most shore stations monitor several frequencies. The frequencies with the longest range are usually near 20 MHz, but the ionospheric weather (propagation) can dramatically change which frequencies work best. Single-sideband (SSB) is used because the short wave bands are \n\n  Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave (SW) radio frequencies. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30 MHz (100 to 10 metres); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band. Radio waves in the shortwave band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Therefore, short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances, beyond the horizon. This is called skywave or \"skip\" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 64 km (40 miles). Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. Other uses include military over-the-horizon radar, diplomatic communication, amateur radio enthusiasts’ two-way international communication for hobby, education, and emergency service, as well as for long-distance aviation and marine communications.\n\nQuestion: which mode is used for short wave broadcast service\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A sandstorm known as the Calima (similar to the Sirocco wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between 100 to 200 m or even lower, and together with very warm temperatures, it can even bring African locusts to the island.\n\n During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year.

The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in Egypt as the khamsin, on the Mediterranean as the sirocco, it is called on the Guinea coast the harmattan. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the Kalahari Desert in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.\n\n and particularly during the windy harmattan season, the city experiences a breezy \"dry heat\" that feels less warm than the \"cooler\" but more humid rainy season. As Kpassa is close to the equator, the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year. Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the mid-afternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Kpassa is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16 km/h. High wind gusts occur with thunderstorms, which generally pass in squalls along the coast. The maximum wind speed record in Kpassa is 107.4 km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Kpassa experience microclimatic effects.

The game consists primarily of one-on-one battles, taking place on what is known as a battle map where the two characters duel. Players are able to perform two types of attacks: a Bravery attack and an HP attack. Both characters start with a set number of Bravery points, the number of Bravery points being equivalent to the amount of damage dealt by an HP attack. Thus, the player must perform several Bravery attacks to steal Bravery points from the opponent so as to increase the power of their HP attack, as Bravery attacks do not cause any damage.\n\n first entry in the main Sakura Wars series to use an action-based battle system.

Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin, then French President and Prime Minister respectively, intervened during the closing session, reaffirming France's commitment to the protection of human rights defenders. On 9 December 1998, in New York, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, now commonly known as the Declaration on human rights defenders.

Proclaimed by the newly constructed United Nations, at the General Assembly in Paris on the 10th of December, 1948, the declaration signposted 30 key human rights that should be universally granted to every human. Although the Declaration is not legally binding in itself, subsequent international treaties, amendments to constitutions, and economic agreements affirm the declaration. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is seen as the precursor to the International Bill of Human Rights, which consists of the UDHR, as well as the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, 1966) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR, 1996). This extension of the UDHR provided a legal reason for states to ensure maintenance of human rights, in addition to the moral obligation established by the initial proclamation of the UDHR in 1948.\n\nThe Persian Empire of ancient Iran established unprecedented principles of human rights in the 6th century BC under Cyrus the Great.

T. A. Hoffmann, in which young Marie Stahlbaum's favorite Christmas toy, the Nutcracker, comes alive and, after defeating the evil Mouse King in battle, whisks her away to a magical kingdom populated by dolls. In 1892, the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov turned Alexandre Dumas's adaptation of the story into the ballet The Nutcracker.\n\nThe Classic Nutcracker: First performed in 1987 before the official founding of Ballet Minnesota, The Classic Nutcracker has become a tradition for countless families in the Twin Cities area. The classic ballet is presented to over 10,000 audience members each holiday season.  \n\n A narrative ballet or story ballet is a form of ballet that has a plot and characters. It is typically a production with full sets and costumes. It was an invention of the eighteenth century. Most romantic and classical ballets of the 19th century were narrative ballets. Among the most well known are Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. For these and other classic narrative ballets it is common for ballet directors to create their own choreography, while maintaining the plot and music used by the original 19th-century choreographer. Kenneth MacMillan and Frederick Ashton were neoclassical ballet choreographers that created original narrative ballets in the 20th century. Narrative ballets are essential to a ballet company's repertoire, because they tend to generate the highest sales and bring families with children to see the ballet. Many newer narrative ballets are adapted from familiar stories or literature because they are recognizable to audiences.\n\n Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's popular 1892 ballet The Nutcracker is derived from E. T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. The ballet's scenario, crafted by Ivan Vsevolozhsky and Marius Petipa after a French adaptation by Alexandre Dumas, is far simpler and less nuanced than Hoffmann's original story. Vsevolozhsky and Petipa entirely omitted the Nutcracker character's complex backstory, \"The Story of the Hard Nut,\" and expanded a short, satiric passage set in a Kingdom of Sweets to cover the whole of Act II. The ballet's scenario also introduced smaller changes, such as changing the heroine's name from Marie to Clara.

The concept of garden city assumed the construction of urban bodies located around a kernel harbouring a public recreational green area, with rings of housing estates made of small plots of single-family houses, outer rings hosting public utility buildings and further out production plants. Howard's idea was especially described in his book Garden Cities of To-morrow published in 1902. Though the first garden city was located in England (Letchworth-1903), soon other instances appeared in Poland: Ząbki near Warsaw (1912), Podkowa Leśna \n\n Although aspirations of dispersing great cities are as old as the industrial revolution itself, it was not until 1817 that the first model communities were proposed by social reformer Robert Owen to address overcrowded towns. Inspired by John Bellers’s 1695 proposal for a College of Industry, a colony for the poor enabling disadvantaged people to work and their children to be educated, Owen proposed small, self-contained communities of about twelve hundred people reliant on agriculture but with some other industry. However, his plans “foundered under the heavy weight of revolutionary ideas” Further model community ideas continued to arise but were each dismissed owing to the perception that they were unconvincing as business ventures. Enter Ebenezer Howard, creator of the Garden City Movement, who successfully founded Letchworth Garden City (1903) and proved that new towns could be economically viable. This was affirmed by Bernard Shaw, co-founder of the London School of Economics, who referred to his investments in the garden city movement as “entirely satisfactory, both economically and morally.”\n\n the self-sufficient garden city to house 32,000 people on a site of 6000 acres. He planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial boulevards, 120 ft wide, extending from the center. When it reached full population, Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail. His model for a garden city was first created at Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. Howard's movement was extended by Sir Frederic Osborn to regional planning.\n\n The village of New Earswick was built as a genuine mixed community. There was housing for both workers and managers, in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees. It was founded by the York philanthropist, Joseph Rowntree, who was quoted as saying, \"I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities\". The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin, after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust) was established to continue building and manage the new \n\n of Earswick, two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York. The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new 'garden' village and the detailed designs for its first houses. They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low, but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested. Houses were open to any working people, not just Rowntree employees. The village was to be a demonstration of good practice.

Each part of the eye plays a special role in the visual process that allows us to see. An abnormality in any part of this complex system can lead to problems with your vision.\nThe eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time.\nThe iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye.\nThe cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera.\nCells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image.\nThe anterior chamber is the fluid-filled space in the front of the eye, between the cornea and the iris.\nAlso known as intraocular fluid, this clear, watery liquid is produced by the ciliary body and flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber. Aqueous humour consists of 99.9% water and 0.1% sugars, vitamins, proteins and other nutrients.\nAqueous humour helps the eye maintain its pressure and provide nutrients to the internal part of the eye. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level.\nThe choroid is a layer of tissue packed with blood vessels that is located between the sclera and the retina. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished.\nLocated between the iris and the choroid, the ciliary body helps with holding the lens in position, changing its shape when focusing or accomodating, and producing aqueous humour.\nThe muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation.\nThis is the clear, thin membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and the white of the eye. It helps to keep the eye moist and lubricated, and protect it from debris and infection. The conjunctiva also contains tiny blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the eye and eyelids.\nThe cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye.\nThis is the part of the eye at the junction of the iris and cornea. Aqueous humour drains out of the eye via the trabecular meshwork and enters the bloodstream in order to keep the pressure in the eye stable. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle.\nThis is a small pit-like structure in the central area of the retina, which contains only cone light receptor cells (no rod cells) and provides the sharpest vision.\nThe iris is the coloured part of the eye that sits behind the cornea. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre).\nLocated directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. The lens can change its thickness and curvature to focus on objects at different distances and to make sure that the image is as clear as possible (this process is known as accomodation).\nThis small and highly sensitive area in the central retina is responsible for seeing fine detail, such as letters and faces.\nThe optic disc or optic nerve head is the circular area on the retina where the optic nerve enters the eye.\nThe optic nerve is a bundle of more than 1 million nerve fibres that carries electrical messages from the retina to the brain for processing.\nThe posterior chamber is the area of the eye behind the lens and in front of the retina. It is filled with the vitreous humour, a clear gel.\nThe pupil is the dark, round area in the centre of the iris, which is actually an opening. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The pupil gets larger (dilates) when exposed to low-light conditions, such as those experienced at night, and gets smaller (constricts) in bright light.\nThe retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Rods process light in low-light conditions, while cones process light in well-lit conditions and can see colour. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The retina turns the light-ray activity (‘picture’) into an electrical message, which is sent via the optic nerve to the brain for decoding.\nThe sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The sclera also continues around to the back of the eye and the optic disc. Consisting of thick connective tissue, it forms the supporting wall of the eye and protects its internal structures.\nThese are small glands inside the upper eyelid, which produce the majority of our tears. Tears help to keep the surface of the eye moist and lubricated, provide oxygen and nutrition to the surface of the eye, protect the eye from damage, clear away foreign objects and help to prevent infection. The nasolacrimal duct on the inner eyelids helps to drain tears away from the eye.\nThe collective name given to the iris, the choroid and the ciliary body.\nThe vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. It consists of 99% water and 1% collagen, proteins, salts and sugars. Although mostly water, this fluid has a firm, jelly-like consistency.\nThe vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away.\nVision Eye Institute is the leading provider of ophthalmic services in Australia. Our team of highly regarded doctors includes general ophthalmologists, as well as those who specialise in specific areas/conditions of the eye.\n\n The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first. Light is then refracted when passed through the cornea because it has a curved convex shape. \"The image formed by the cornea is upside down and reversed from right to left.\"(Journey N, 1997-2019) The layers of the cornea in raptors include the, Anterior corneal epithelium, Anterior limiting lamina (Bowman's layer), Substantia propria (stroma comprising the majority of corneal thickness),Posterior limiting lamina (Descemet's membrane) Posterior epithelium (endothelium). The iris in eagles appears yellow and functions similarly to the iris in humans. The iris contracts and dilates to control the amount of light the received \n\n Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. This is not just due to the white color of the human sclera, which many other species share, but also to the fact that the human iris is relatively small and comprises a significantly smaller portion of the exposed eye surface compared to other animals. It is theorized that this adaptation evolved because of our social nature as the eye became a useful communication tool in addition to a sensory organ. It is believed that the conspicuous sclera of the human eye makes it easier for one individual to identify where another individual is looking, increasing the efficacy of this particular form of nonverbal communication. Animal researchers have also found that, in the course of their domestication, dogs have also developed the ability to pick up visual cues from the eyes of humans. Dogs do not seem to use this form of communication with one another and only look for visual information from the eyes of humans.\n\n The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the photons (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. Rhodopsin, which is usually pink, becomes bleached in the process. At high levels of light, photopigments are broken apart faster than can be regenerated. Because a low number of photopigments have been regenerated, the eyes are not sensitive to light. When entering a dark room after being in a well lit area, the eyes require time for a good quantity of rhodopsin to regenerate. As more time passes, there is a higher chance that the photons will split an unbleached photopigment because the rate of regeneration will have surpassed the rate of bleaching. This is called adaptation.\n\n signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound. The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, the cornea becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.\n\nQuestion: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Blankenship, David Tobias, Robert Dunfield, and Fred Nolan formed a syndicate for exploration on Oak Island. Two years later, Blankenship and Tobias formed Triton Alliance after purchasing most of the island. Several former landowners, including Mel Chappell, became shareholders in Triton. Triton workers excavated a 235 ft shaft, known as Borehole 10-X and supported by a steel caisson to bedrock, in 1971. According to Blankenship and Tobias, cameras lowered down the shaft into a cave recorded possible chests, human remains, wooden cribbing and tools; however, the images were unclear and none of the claims have been independently confirmed. The shaft later collapsed, and the \n\n in Oak Island Tours announced on their website that the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and Department of Tourism, Culture and Heritage had granted them a treasure-trove license which allowed them to resume activities until December 31, 2010. After December 2010, the departments repealed the treasure-trove license and replaced it with an Oak Island Treasure Act. The act, which became effective on January 1, 2011, allows treasure hunting to continue on the island under the terms of a licence issued by the Minister of Natural Resources. Exploration by the Lagina brothers has been documented in a reality television show airing on the History channel starting in 2014.\n\n Oak Island Mystery refers to stories of buried treasure and unexplained objects found on or near Oak Island in Nova Scotia. Since the 18th century, a number of attempts have been made to locate treasure and artifacts. Theories about artifacts present on the island range from pirate treasure to Shakespearean manuscripts to possibly the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, with the Grail and the Ark having been buried there by the Knights Templar. Various items have surfaced over the years that were found on the island, some of which have since been carbon-dated and found to be hundreds of years old. Although these items can be considered treasure in their own right, no significant main treasure site has ever been found. The site consists of digs by numerous people and groups of people. The original shaft, in an unknown location today, was dug by early explorers and known as \"the money pit\". \"The curse\" is said to have originated more than a century ago and states that seven men will die in the search for the treasure before it is found. To date, six men have died in their efforts to find the treasure.\n\nMarty Lagina – A millionaire vineyard owner who is also part owner of most of Oak Island in Nova Scotia and one of the main characters on The Curse of Oak Island, the parent series ; Kevin Dykstra – A facilities director at a Muskegon high school and part time treasure hunter who is a certified diver ; Brad Richards – A history teacher and part time treasure hunter ; Fred Monroe – A researcher, Kevin's friend and a part time treasure hunter ; Al Dykstra – Kevin's younger brother and a certified diver ; Jeff Zehr – A researcher on the team who is a certified diver ; Alex Lagina – Son of Marty Lagina and a certified diver. \n\n The Curse of Oak Island is a multi-season reality television series that chronicles an eclectic team of treasure hunters and their search for legendary treasure on the infamous Oak Island, off the shore of Nova Scotia, Canada.

Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Once a fistula has formed, a stone may travel from the gallbladder into the bowel and become lodged almost anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Obstruction occurs most commonly at the near the distal ileum, within 60 cm proximally to the ileocecal valve. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name \"gallstone ileus\" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone).\n\n Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. It is particularly common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, Japan and northern India; it is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native American Indians and Hispanics. If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and associated lymph nodes. Most often it is found after symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other organs such as the liver. It is a rare cancer that is thought to be related to gallstones building up, which also can lead to calcification of the gallbladder, a condition known as porcelain gallbladder. Porcelain gallbladder is also rare. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. The outlook is poor for recovery if the cancer is found after symptoms have started to occur, with a 5-year survival rate of close to 3%.\n\n**\n\n#### THE PANCREAS\n\n#### the 30-second anatomy\n\nThe pancreas has a head, an uncinate process (a U-shaped protuberance), a neck and a tail.It receives 80 per cent deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen via the portal vein and 20 per cent oxygenated blood via the hepatic artery. Within the liver lobes, deoxygenated blood flows through spaces called sinusoids. Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava. The hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported through ducts to the gall bladder. The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat. Food entering the stomach stimulates the production of the chemical cholecystokinin, which causes the gall bladder to release bile into the small intestine through a sphincter known as the ampulla of Vater. **3-SECOND INCISION**\n\nThe liver is the body's largest gland; it removes toxicants, produces bile to assist digestion and breaks down red blood cells. The gall bladder stores bile for use by the small intestine. **3-MINUTE DISSECTION**\n\nAs the main site for detoxification of substances from the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is vulnerable to damage. If damage occurs, remaining liver cells can divide to create new cells – replacing lost tissue and restoring the liver's functionality. The gall bladder not only stores bile but also absorbs water from it and, as a result, the bile becomes more concentrated and more powerful at breaking down fats. **RELATED TOPICS**\n\nTHE SMALL INTESTINE\n\nTHE PANCREAS\n\n**3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY**\n\nABRAHAM VATER\n\n**1684–1751**\n\nThe discoverer in 1720 of the ampulla of Vater\n\n**30-SECOND TEXT**\n\nClaire France Smith\n\n**_Bile produced by the gall bladder may crystallize and cause inflammation or blockages that require the organ's removal in a cholecystectomy_. **\n\n#### THE PANCREAS\n\n#### the 30-second anatomy\n\nThe pancreas has a head, an uncinate process (a U-shaped protuberance), a neck and a tail.The head nestles into the duodenum, the C-shaped first section of the small intestine.The pancreas is a lobulated gland (one with many lobules or small sections of tissue) and its cells are divided into two functional groups: exocrine and endocrine cells.The exocrine cells secrete enzymes that aid food digestion.\n\nIts function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat.The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver.The hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported through ducts to the gall bladder.Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava.In humans the caecum is about 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length, but in animals the caecum/appendix can be very long; for example, in horses it can measure up to 1 metre (3 feet 4 inches) and contains enzymes for processing grass-based food. **RELATED TOPICS**\n\nTHE STOMACH\n\nTHE SMALL INTESTINE\n\n**3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY**\n\nJOHANN NATHANAEL LIEBERKÜHN\n\n**1711–56**\n\nA German anatomist who first described intestinal glands in the large intestine\n\n**30-SECOND TEXT**\n\nClaire France Smith\n\n**_The large intestine is much shorter than the small intestine – 1.5 metres (5 feet) compared to 7 metres (23 feet); it is called large because it is about twice as wide_. **\n\n#### THE LIVER & GALL BLADDER\n\n#### the 30-second anatomy\n\nThe liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, just below the diaphragm. It is anatomically split into unequal right and left lobes by the falciform ligament, and functionally divided into eight segments by the distribution of blood vessels. In addition to removing toxicants, producing bile and breaking down red blood cells, the liver synthesizes and stores glycogen (from carbohydrates) and produces hormones. It receives 80 per cent deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen via the portal vein and 20 per cent oxygenated blood via the hepatic artery. Within the liver lobes, deoxygenated blood flows through spaces called sinusoids. Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava.

It is located near the liver and has three portions: the fundus, body, and neck. The neck of the gall bladder connects with the liver via the hepatic duct. When stimulated, the gall bladder releases its secretion, which is bile, into the small intestine through the common bile duct. This secretion helps with the digestion and absorption of fats during a meal.\n\nThe gall bladder is lined with a simple columnar epithelial tissue, and its walls are composed of three visible coats: an internal mucous and muscular coat, a middle connective tissue layer, and an outermost serous membrane. The organ receives a network of capillaries to supply its cells.\n\nThe main function of the gall bladder is to store and concentrate bile. Bile, produced by the hepatocytes in the liver, is transported to the gall bladder for temporary storage. While in the gall bladder, the bile undergoes concentration until it is ready to be released into the small intestine. During a fatty meal, the gall bladder contracts to release bile into the small intestine to emulsify fats and neutralize the acids in the partially-digested food. Bile, as a dark green fluid, acts as a surfactant to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the formation of gallstones is a common issue associated with the gall bladder due to its high cholesterol content. In some cases, when gallstones cause complications or persistent symptoms, a surgical procedure called cholecystectomy may be necessary to remove the gall bladder.\n\nQuestion: where is gall bladder situated in human body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 1934 to the present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar. Gold and silver coins have been previously minted for general circulation from the 18th to the 20th centuries. The last gold coins were minted in 1933. The last 90% silver coins were minted in 1964, and the last 40% silver half dollar was minted in 1970. The United States Mint currently produces circulating coins at the Philadelphia and Denver Mints, and commemorative and proof coins for collectors at the San Francisco and West Point Mints. Mint mark conventions for these and for past mint branches are discussed in Coins of the United States dollar.

These were the first truly modern coins; the mass-production of coinage with steam driven machinery organised in factories enabled the achievement of standardized dimensions and uniform weight and roundness, something no counterfeiter of the day could hope to achieve.

The Assayer, Chief Coiner and Treasurer were required to post a $10,000 bond with the Secretary of the Treasury.

A spring behind the copper cathode substrate holds the layers together as the electrodes change thickness. The cathode comprises particles of sulfur \"redox center\", carbon, and electrolyte. During discharge, the lithium ions plate the cathode with lithium metal and the sulfur is not reduced unless irreversible deep discharge occurs. The thickened cathode is a compact way to store the used lithium. During recharge, this lithium moves back into the glassy electrolyte and eventually plates the anode, which thickens. No dendrites form. The cell has 3 times the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries. An extended life of more than 1,200 cycles was demonstrated. The design also allows the substitution of sodium for lithium minimizing lithium environmental issues.\n\n In 2000, researchers from the Université de Picardie Jules Verne examined the use of nano-sized transition-metal oxides as conversion anode materials. The metals used were cobalt, nickel, copper, and iron, which proved to have capacities of 700 mA h/g and maintain full capacity for 100 cycles. The materials operate by reduction of the metal cation to either metal nanoparticles or to a lower oxidation state oxide. These promising results show that transition-metal oxides may be useful in ensuring the integrity of the lithium-ion battery over many discharge-recharge cycles.\n\n In 2014, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that creating high lithium content lithium-ion batteries materials with cation disorder among the electroactive metals could achieve 660 watt-hours per kilogram at 2.5 volts. The materials of the stoichiometry Li2MO3-LiMO2 are similar to the lithium rich lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) materials but without the cation ordering. The extra lithium creates better diffusion pathways and eliminates high energy transition points in the structure that inhibit lithium diffusion.\n\n The lithium iron phosphate battery ( battery) or LFP battery (lithium ferrophosphate), is a type of lithium-ion battery using lithium iron phosphate  as the cathode material, and a graphitic carbon electrode with a metallic backing as the anode. The energy density of is lower than that of lithium cobalt oxide, and also has a lower operating voltage. The charge-discharge profiles of LFP cells are typically very flat. The main drawback of is its low electrical conductivity. Therefore, all the cathodes under consideration are actually /C (composite made with carbon). Because of low cost, low toxicity, well-defined performance, long-term stability, etc. is finding a number of roles in vehicle use, utility scale stationary applications, and backup power. LFP batteries are cobalt-free.\n\n LiFePO4 is a 3.6 V lithium-ion battery cathode initially reported by John Goodenough and is structurally related to the mineral olivine and consists of a three dimensional lattice of an [FePO4] framework surrounding a lithium cation. The lithium cation sits in a one dimensional channel along the [010] axis of the crystal structure. This alignment yields anisotropic ionic conductivity that has implications for its usage as a battery cathode and makes morphological control an important variable in its electrochemical cell rate performance. Although the iron analogue is the most commercial owing to its stability, the same composition exists for nickel, manganese, and cobalt although the observed high cell charging voltages and synthetic challenges for these materials make them viable but more difficult to commercialize.

Although its administrative provisions are to a large extent based on the Government of India Act 1935, it also contains various other provisions that were drawn from other constitutions in the world at the time of its creation. It provides details of the administration of both the Union and the States, and codifies the relations between the Federal Government and the State Governments. Also incorporated into the text are a chapter on the fundamental rights of citizens, as well as a chapter on directive \n\n The constitution defines the state economy as a planned socialist economy which aims to end all forms of exploitation. Three forms of property is presented by the constitution: public, collective and individual property. The constitution guarantees that private property shall not be expropriated except for the public interest and in return for fair compensation.\n\n The Indian constitution's preamble states that India is a secular state. Freedom of religion is a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution. According to Article 25 of the Indian Constitution, every citizen of India has the right to \"profess, practice and propagate religion\", \"subject to public order, morality and health\" and also subject to other provisions under that article. Article 25 (2b) uses the term \"Hindus\" for all classes and sections of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs. Sikhs and Buddhists objected to this wording that makes many Hindu personal laws applicable to them. However, the same article also guarantees the right of members of the Sikh faith to bear a Kirpan. \n\n the state's 'eminent domain' powers. The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights. A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution to provide, \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears \n\n The Constitution of India originally provided for the Fundamental Right to property under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to 'acquire, hold and dispose of property'. Article 31 provided that \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.\" It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been 'taken possession of or acquired' for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the \"acquisition or requisition of property\" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III).

After winning a majority of delegates in the Democratic primaries of 2008, on August 23, leading up to the convention, the campaign announced that Senator Joe Biden of Delaware would be the vice presidential nominee. At the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 27, Barack Obama was formally selected as the Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States in 2008. He was the first African American in history to be nominated on a major party ticket. On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, making him the President-elect and the first African American elected President. He was the third sitting U.S. Senator, after Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy, to be elected president. Upon the vote of the Electoral College on December 15, 2008, and the subsequent certification thereof by a Joint Session of the United States Congress on January 8, 2009, Barack Obama was elected as President of the United States and Joe Biden as Vice President of the United States, with 365 of 538 electors.\n\nVice President of the United States: Joe Biden President of the United States: Joe Biden In the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Senator Joe Biden was elected Vice President of the United States alongside Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who was elected President of the United States.

Biden assumed the Vice Presidency on January 20, 2009 and served until January 20, 2017.  In the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, Joe Biden was elected President of the United States alongside California Senator Kamala Harris, who was elected Vice President of the United States. He is the first Delawarean to be elected to the office of the President. He is sworn in on January 20, 2021. \n\n  Joe Biden is an American politician and the 46th and current president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, Biden represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. As the running mate of Barack Obama, Biden was elected vice president of the United States in 2008 and 2012. In his third presidential campaign—following previous efforts in 1988 and 2008—he was elected President of the United States in 2020. The Onion is an American publication that parodies traditional newspapers and satirizes current events. Founded in 1988 in Madison, Wisconsin as a weekly satirical print newspaper, it began publishing online in 1996 and discontinued its print edition in 2013. Articles in The Onion often lampoon real-world public figures and events using fictitious elements. The Onion had a few noteworthy instances of consistent characterizations over time prior to Biden, such as portrayals of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in the 1990s. Chad Nackers, the writer who created the Biden character, joined The Onion in 1997.

The fossa consists of three parts, superior, intermediate, and inferior: The sulcus limitans forms the lateral boundary of the medial eminence.\n\n The cerebellum is located in the posterior cranial fossa. The fourth ventricle, pons and medulla are in front of the cerebellum. It is separated from the overlying cerebrum by a layer of leathery dura mater, the tentorium cerebelli; all of its connections with other parts of the brain travel through the pons. Anatomists classify the cerebellum as part of the metencephalon, which also includes the pons; the metencephalon is the upper part of the rhombencephalon or \"hindbrain\". Like the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum is divided into two cerebellar hemispheres; it also contains a narrow midline zone (the vermis). A set of large folds is, by convention, used \n\nThe anterior point of attachment for the tentorium cerebelli is the rounded anterior clinoid processes, which are found at the ends of the medial portion of each lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. These processes serve as the anchor points for the tentorium cerebelli, a sheet of dura that separates the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres from the cerebellum.\n\nAdjacent to each anterior clinoid process, there is a circular opening in the lesser wing of the sphenoid known as the optic canal. This canal allows passage for the ophthalmic artery and the optic nerve (cranial nerve II) as they exit the cranial cavity and enter the orbit. The optic canals are typically located within the middle cranial fossa, which is formed by parts of the sphenoid and temporal bones.\n\nThe midline boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae is the anterior edge of the prechiasmatic sulcus, which is a smooth groove extending between the optic canals across the body of the sphenoid. The posterior boundaries of the middle cranial fossa are formed by the anterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The floor of the middle cranial fossa is elevated and formed by the body of the sphenoid, while the temporal lobes of the brain occupy large depressions on either side, formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid and the squamous part of the temporal bone.\n\nJust posterior to the chiasmatic sulcus is the sella turcica, a uniquely modified portion of the body of the sphenoid bone. It consists of a deep central area called the hypophyseal fossa, which contains the pituitary gland.

The article deals with the series' main, recurring, and minor characters.\n\nMain\n\nOverview\n\nNotes\n\nDr. Will Halstead\n\nPortrayed by Nick Gehlfuss\n\nDr. Will Halstead is an attending in the Emergency Department. He was first introduced to the Chicago franchise in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Say Her Real Name\" as Detective Jay Halstead's estranged brother who drops by to visit in a two-episode arc. The character moved to Med after being introduced in the show's backdoor pilot on Chicago Fire and Gehlfuss was made a regular cast member when the characters at Chicago Medical Center who appeared in both Fire and P.D. were given their own spin-off.\n\nDr. Halstead was initially written as a plastic surgeon who left his private practice (or was implied in P.D. to have been \"kicked out\") in New York City and returned home to Chicago. After the backdoor pilot of Chicago Med, he decided to switch specialties to emergency medicine. When Med first premiered, he was Chief Resident. As of season 2 he has been an attending. He is characterized as a competent and compassionate doctor who tries to do what he thinks is best for his patient but his single-minded stubbornness has sometimes clouded his judgment, such as when he insists on a particular course of action that is contrary to both advice and evidence. Charge Nurse Maggie Lockwood, who sometimes uses the nickname \"Big Red\" when referring to Dr. Halstead, once described him as \"a slightly anal, overly stubborn, rule breaking, control freak\". Dr. Halstead's relationship with hospital administrator Sharon Goodwin has been historically fraught, and Halstead's job has been jeopardized on multiple occasions.\n\nIn season 1 Dr. Halstead clashes a number of times with Dr. Connor Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and Sharon Goodwin, the chief administrator, over hospital practices and policies. He particularly disliked Dr. Rhodes as he felt the latter was an entitled \"rich kid\" from the more affluent northern suburbs. They eventually call an unspoken truce by the end of the season as they developed a mutual professional respect for one another. During the episode \"Choices\" he finds himself in hot water after ignoring a patient's DNR and faces a lawsuit as a result. He also earns the ire of attending Dr. Kendra Perrington in the episode \"Inheritance\" for overriding her at the request of the patient's brother, who was his former schoolmate, only to find out that she was on the hiring committee. This put his job prospects in jeopardy as he was in the last year of his residency. In the season 1 finale he receives a letter of offer for an attending position in the ED, much to his relief. For much of early season 2, he stresses out over his finances as he still had to pay off his student loans and sizeable malpractice insurance (due to his malpractice suit from the episode \"Clarity\"). He initially sees final year medical student Jeff Clarke as a rival for Natalie's affections but develops a friendship with Clarke and often encourages him.\n\nDuring the first season, Dr. Halstead had feelings for the pediatric emergency medicine fellow, Dr. Natalie Manning, who was then pregnant with her late husband's baby. It caused some awkwardness as her mother-in-law (portrayed by actress Annie Potts) was extremely protective and initially viewed him with suspicion. He eventually decided to move on and starts dating pathologist Nina Shore (portrayed by Patti Murin, the real-life wife of Gehlfuss' co-star Colin Donnell). They move in together in the season 2 episode \"Free Will\". They break up in finale of season 2 because he still has feelings for Dr. Manning. In the first episode of season 3 “Nothing To Fear”, she returns from a three-month sabbatical and tells him she also has feelings for him too and they became a couple. In season 4 they prepare for their wedding but Dr. Halstead finds himself in a difficult position when a neighborhood friend he made a house call to turns out to be federally listed criminal wanted by both the CPD and FBI. His brother convinces him to continue making the house calls in order to feed information to the joint CPD-FBI task force.\n\nWhen he was first introduced on P.D., it was implied that he and Jay had not seen each other for some time. Jay still has some lingering bitterness over the fact that Will was not around when their late mother was ill (she died of cancer). Despite this, they remain close and look out for one another. The brothers had a difficult relationship with their late father Pat as he disapproved of both his sons' occupations. The Halsteads are from a working class Irish Catholic background, as implied by Will's statements about growing up in Canaryville, a historically Irish neighborhood in the South Side of Chicago, and being an altar boy in his youth. Will attended De La Salle Institute, where he excelled academically but was also bullied by the more popular students and given the derogatory nickname \"Ginger Spice\". It is likely that he and his brother were ostracized for coming from a lower socioeconomic background as Jay has also made a reference to being ostracized by his more affluent counterparts at private school.\n\nDr. Halstead plays the guitar and performed at weddings to pay his way through medical school. It was a reference to actor Nick Gehlfuss's days as a busker in New York City when he first entered the acting industry.\n\nHe is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox like his father.\n\nDr. Natalie Manning\n\nPortrayed by Torrey DeVitto\n\nDr. Natalie Manning (née Conte) is a pediatrician originally from Seattle who is an attending in emergency medicine specializing in pediatrics.\n\nNatalie was widowed when her husband, Jeff, a soldier, was killed in Afghanistan and gave birth to their son, Owen. She is revealed to be a skilled  violinist, as seen in season 1 episode \"Fallback\" and season 2 episode \"Brother's Keeper\".\n\nIn season 1, Natalie is portrayed as a caring doctor who sometimes becomes overly emotionally connected to her young patients. In Season 1, Episode 10, \"Clarity\", Dr Will Halstead kisses her, showing her that he has feelings for her. However, as she is grieving her late husband, she gently tells Dr Halstead that she does have feelings for him, it just \"isn't the right time yet\".\n\nAt the start of Season 2, she begins a relationship with Jeff Clarke. However, she breaks up with him after he \"humiliates\" her during a M&M review. He also reveals that he wished she was his wife, and not his ex Lisa, which makes her angry that he didn't tell her before she let him \"into her life and her bed\". After the breakup, she begins to have feelings for Will, but he is in a relationship with Nina Shore. After their break up, he ends up dancing with Natalie while at Noah's graduation party.\n\nIn the first episode of the third season “Nothing To Fear”, Natalie returns from a three-month sabbatical and tells Will she has feelings for him and they became a couple. They go on a break near the end of Season 3, where he drunkenly kisses one of Natalie's old co-workers. After she finds out, she becomes angry at him but he proposes to her in the season 3 finale anyway.\n\nSeason 4 sees the couple planning for their wedding, which shows that Natalie accepted his proposal. It also shows the couple attending Pre-Cana together. After Will was brought into protective custody during their wedding, they eventually broke up and Natalie returned his ring. At the end of Season 4, Agent Lee convinces Natalie to take Will back, so she goes after him and gets into his car as she was going to tell him that she still loves him, until a car hits them.\n\nNatalie was brought into the ED at the start of Season 5, where she was diagnosed with a TBI. While unconscious, her ex-boyfriend, Phillip Davis slipped a ring onto her finger and convinced everyone that they were engaged, except for Dr Marcel who brings it up with Phillip and tells Will. She eventually finds out and calls it off, before trying to get back with Will, who has moved on to Dr Asher. It is unknown if she still likes Will or if he has any feelings left for her, but it is assumed that she has feelings for Dr Marcel after they were in a hostage situation in the Season 5 finale.\n\nIn Season 6, Natalie alters data on a trial Will is running to have her mother accepted. She then stole medication to treat her mother in secret. Will was irate when finding out but ready to take the blame for it. Knowing it could ruin his career, Natalie confessed what she'd done. The opening of Season 7 revealed Natalie had been fired and was leaving Chicago for a fresh start.\n\nApril Sexton\n\nPortrayed by Yaya DaCosta\n\nApril Sexton is a nurse in the Emergency Department. She was first introduced in Chicago Fire as a friend of Lieutenant Kelly Severide.\n\nApril's parents were immigrants from Brazil. Their original family name was Suassuna but they anglicized it to \"Sexton\" as it was easier to pronounce. She attended high school with Severide and they share a close friendship. He had been going through a rebellious phase in high school after being abandoned by his father and the Sextons often invited him to their house out of concern.\n\nApril is courted by an ex-pro football player, Tate Jenkins (Daren J. Powell) whom she meets when Tate brings his young son into the ED. She is initially skeptical and views Tate as a \"player,\" but after getting to know each other, she develops a trust in him and they move in together. He proposes to her in the episode \"Inherent Bias\".\n\nIn season 2, April is infected with Tuberculosis from a needle stick in the ED and has to deal with the ramifications in her personal and professional life. In the season 2 fall finale, it was revealed she that she is pregnant. However, the treatment for her tuberculosis put her in a difficult position as the medication was potentially harmful to the fetus. She refused to have an abortion due to her Catholic faith. However, April suffers a miscarriage and her engagement to Tate ends.\n\nIn the season 2 finale, “Love Hurts” the doctors celebrate Noah Sexton's (April's younger brother) graduation party after he graduated medical school. April walks away from the party noticing that Noah is having a lot of fun. She walks over to a bridge and overlooks the water. As she stands there, Dr. Ethan Choi walks over and kisses her.\n\nIn season 3, Choi and April began a relationship, which they hide from the ED. A nurse grows suspicious of them and asks her questions, which April simply ignores. Later on, she opens up about her relationship to her coworkers in the ED. The two often clash in the ED about medical judgements over their patients, but continue to be very supportive of each other.\n\nDr. Sarah Reese\n\nPortrayed by Rachel DiPillo\n\nDr. Sarah Reese is a recent medical school graduate and psychiatry resident. The character was not introduced in the backdoor pilot on Chicago Fire.\n\nIn season 1 she was a final year medical student, still undecided about which specialty to choose. During her rotation in the ED, she decided against emergency medicine after a patient she had diagnosed chose to go against medical advice, leaving her discouraged. She chose pathology, but soon realized that she did not want to spend the rest of her training in a lab without any contact with patients, and even fainted from the stress. However, as her match was legally binding it meant that she would be left without a job if she rejected Chicago Med's offer. She worked as a barista until the head of psychiatry, Dr. Charles, offered her a spot in his department. She discovers that she enjoys interacting with patients and learning about the psychological side of medicine, although it leads her to subconsciously \"shrink\" her own colleagues, much to the nurses' amusement. Season 2 sees the character undergo further development as a full-fledged doctor and resident. At times she has let her emotions get in the way and Dr. Charles has had to step in to caution her. She has difficulty dealing with death and the experience of having to call time of death on a patient gets to her. During a night shift she had to make the call three times in a row, leading to her breaking down into tears at the end of the shift.\n\nHer mother is a litigation attorney, implied to be a career woman who loves Sarah but is emotionally distant from her. During the season 1 finale, Sarah's mother does not attend her graduation from medical school but sends her money. She is a main cast member from season one until season four and appears for the final time in the season four premiere \"Be My Better Half\". This episode takes place after she found out that Doctor Charles discovered that her father was suspected to be a serial killer, causing a fallout between them. She decided to leave Chicago Med and joined Baylor, as she said she could no longer trust Dr. Charles when he kept information about her father from her.\n\nDr. Connor Rhodes\n\nPortrayed by Colin Donnell\n\nDr. Connor Rhodes is a cardiothoracic surgery fellow. The character was not introduced in the backdoor pilot aired on Chicago Fire, as Colin Donnell only joined the cast as a series regular when Chicago Med was picked up.\n\nDr. Rhodes attended Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara in Mexico and spent a year in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia following his residency. He was initially a trauma surgery fellow but switched to cardiothoracic surgery under the  mentorship of Dr. David Downey, a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon. After Dr. Downey died, Connor was mentored by Dr. Latham, with whom he has a difficult relationship.\n\nDr. Rhodes comes from a wealthy background and was written as a \"local boy\" who left Chicago to escape his family before returning many years later. His background was a source of embarrassment and he initially tried to hide it from his colleagues in the ED, though they came to accept him as one of them and would good-naturedly tease him whenever his name appeared in a lifestyle magazine. His relationship with his family is complicated and it deteriorated further after his mother's suicide. His father, Cornelius Rhodes, was against Connor choosing to practice medicine rather than work in the family business (a high-end department store in Chicago), and he would repeatedly undermine and discourage Connor to the point where father and son are barely on speaking terms. In the episode \"Inheritance\" his sister Claire resorts to calling him at work and then confronting him in person to call him out on abandoning her in his attempt to get away from their father years ago. At the end of the episode he reluctantly visits her at the department store to take her to dinner, much to her delight. Dr. Rhodes’ mother suffered from chronic depression which caused her to be absent for much of his childhood. Connor remained in denial of this fact, remembering her as a doting and involved parent and blaming his father's infidelities for her suicide. In the episode “Forever Hold Your Peace”, Connor accepts the truth about his relationship with his mother at his father's prodding, but his father dies suddenly before they can reconcile. In the following episode, he visits his father's body in the morgue, and admits that while Cornelius was a bad father, he (Connor) was also a bad son.\n\nHe was in a relationship with attending surgeon Dr. Samantha \"Sam\" Zanetti but they break up in the episode \"Saint\" when she takes a job at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. In season 2 he meets epidemiologist Dr. Robin Charles at the hospital cafeteria and they become friends, although it initially caused some awkwardness once he found out that she was Dr. Daniel Charles' daughter. They began cohabiting in the episode \"Win Loss\". Robin develops health problems that cause difficulties in their relationship; she begins behaving erratically, and it's discovered that she has a brain tumor.  The tumor is successfully removed, but the relationship remains strained throughout her recovery.  In the episode \"Ties That Bind\", Robin broke up with Rhodes by leaving a letter on the table for him to read. He confronted Dr. Charles on the break up and vowed that he will find her to make the relationship work; however, Dr. Charles said that Robin had wanted to get treatment for her condition in peace.\n\nIn Season 3, Rhodes often clashes with Dr. Ava Bekker, a doctor from South Africa who Dr. Latham assigned him to work with. The two have a \"love-hate\" relationship due to their different medical opinions and personalities. At the end of the episode \"Folie à Deux\" they are seen kissing one another. In “Born This Way”, Rhodes is in the kitchen making breakfast as Ava puts on her clothes (implying that they had a one-night stand).  Rhodes seems to want to pursue the relationship, but Bekker tells him that it was a one-time thing.  However, in Season 4 they appear to be giving the relationship a try, although it later falls apart due to Connor's suspicions of Bekker.\n\nIn Season 4, Rhodes is about to leave to take a job at the Mayo Clinic when he is offered the opportunity to run Med's newly-developing hybrid operating room in the hospital's emergency department. He decides to take the job at Med, not knowing that the hybrid OR was funded primarily by an anonymous donation from his father, and was solicited by Dr. Bekker. When Rhodes learns of the donation, his father suggests that Bekker traded sex with him in exchange for the donation. Rhodes breaks up with Bekker and becomes paranoid that she has been deliberately manipulating events to ensure she will remain part of his life, going so far as to accuse her of deliberately exposing herself to HIV and botching his father's heart surgery. When the failed operation is revealed to be due to a faulty implant, Connor briefly considers that he may have been wrong; however his father's sudden death by an insulin overdose, and Bekker's subsequent behaviour, leads him to believe that she is the killer.\n\nIn season 5, after the deaths of both his father and Bekker, who committed suicide after admitting to killing Cornelius in an attempt to win him back, Connor leaves Chicago to have a fresh start.\n\nDr. Ethan Choi\n\nPortrayed by Brian Tee\n\nLieutenant Commander Dr. Ethan Choi, USNR, is the Chief of Emergency Medicine and a former active duty United States Navy officer. Like Dr. Rhodes, the character was not in the backdoor pilot and was only introduced when Chicago Med was picked up. He is generally reserved and reticent, which Dr. Charles attributes to his military background. His aloof and detached exterior sometimes intimidates the medical students and junior residents under him, but he has shown to be sympathetic and supportive with them, as well as his other coworkers and the CFD paramedics. He is of Korean descent (like actor Brian Tee) and once implied that he has been subjected to racism during his childhood, as he grew up in a neighborhood where there were \"not many families with the last name Choi\".\n\nDr. Choi is well-regarded by his colleagues in the ED. Beginning in season 2 he takes over from Dr. Halstead as Chief Resident and has an unforgettable first day, much to everyone's amusement as they were used to seeing him calm and in control. He initially tries to run his own system but quickly realizes that Maggie and the nurses are actually the ones in charge. After his rocky start, he returned to his usual dependable self.\n\nA second generation Navy veteran, Dr. Choi switched to the reserves to begin his residency and is revealed to be suffering from PTSD. He had been coping despite suffering from insomnia and nightmares and initially resisted treatment, as he was still functional at work. Eventually he seeks proper treatment after breaking down in Dr. Charles' office, but used his work as an excuse to put off subsequent counselling sessions. After a series of emotional near-breakdowns and a heated confrontation with a patient's father, he resumes counselling and joins a support group at the VA. He adopts a parrot who refuses to fly, due to trauma from being verbally abused and being cooped up in a hoarder's house for months.  Dr. Choi also volunteers at the zoo as part of his therapy. He has only ever discussed his military service with fellow veterans, as seen in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Forty-Caliber Bread Crumb\", when he has drinks with former Army Rangers and combat veterans Detective Jay Halstead (Dr. Halstead's brother) and CPD tech analyst Greg \"Mouse\" Gurwitch at Molly's. Despite his cool and collected demeanor, it is apparent that he has been deeply affected by the horrors he witnessed overseas as well as in the ED. He has a notebook in which he writes down the name, date and time of death and description of every patient who has died on his watch. In the season 5 episode \"I Can’t Imagine the Future\" he is recalled by the Navy to cover for an aircraft carrier medical officer who had fallen ill and would be deployed for two months.\n\nHe lived with his then girlfriend Dr. Vicky Glass (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), who works at the nearby VA hospital and is a fellow Navy veteran. She is one of the few people he has confided in about his PTSD.\n\nAt the beginning of Season 3, Dr. Choi is seen to be in a relationship with ED nurse April Sexton, though they are keeping the relationship quiet at work.  This is due to April's belief that she will be viewed negatively if her co-workers knew of the relationship.  However, they make the relationship public after April realizes that no one would look down on her or assume she would receive special treatment because she is dating an ED doctor.  Dr. Choi and April clash over how best to handle the troubles of his estranged sister Emily, and at the end of Season 3 she breaks up with him because of this. \n\nIn Season 6, Dr. Choi became the new Chief of Emergency Medicine.\n\nSharon Goodwin\n\nPortrayed by S. Epatha Merkerson\nSharon Goodwin (née McGee), RN, MPH, MBA is the Chief of Services and oversees the day-to-day operations of Gaffney Chicago Medical Center. A former OR nurse, she is generally the final authority when it comes to medico-legal issues, professional ethics and, when necessary, disciplining.\n\nSharon was happily married to Bert. He had been trying to persuade her to retire and entice her with exotic locations to travel to. In the episode \"Intervention\" they celebrated their 32nd wedding anniversary. However, Bert leaves her in the season 1 finale. The first several episodes of season 2 sees her dealing with the emotional fallout and clearing out his belongings from their house. In the episode \"Extreme Measures\" she initiates divorce proceedings and tells the attorney that she and her husband were past reconciliation. Her first love had been photojournalist Reggie Dixon when she was an eighteen-year-old high school graduate but she chose to attend college rather than travel the world with him on his assignments. Bert did not appear on-screen until he brought his new lady-friend to the hospital in the season 2 episode, \"Ctrl Alt\".\n\nDr. Daniel Charles\n\nPortrayed by Oliver Platt\n\nDr. Daniel Charles is the Chief of Psychiatry at Chicago Med. Outside of psychiatry, he is sometimes called in to help with difficult patients or speak to family members. The character has also crossed over to Chicago P.D. whenever Voight's team are dealing with a suspect or victim suffering from a psychiatric disorder which renders them dangerous and unpredictable. He has also been mentioned several times as the \"shrink\" Voight prefers to send his detectives to when they need counselling.\n\nA well-respected veteran psychiatrist at Chicago Med, Dr. Charles combines his human touch with instinct and intuition to diagnose patients. The ED physicians would turn to him for a second opinion. Occasionally he has had to call out doctors in the ED on becoming too personally involved or invested in patients.\n\nHe has been married and divorced at least three times. His third wife is from Spain. One of his daughters Robin works at Chicago Med as an epidemiologist and was in a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. In the season 2 finale, he is shot after a patient waited a long time to be seen and didn't get the care he needed.\n\nMaggie Campbell\n\nPortrayed by Marlyne Barrett\n\nMaggie Campbell (nee Lockwood) is the charge nurse of the Emergency Department and runs a tight ship with a firm hand and a quick-witted sense of humor. She has no qualms about calling out the doctors when needed and they generally defer to her for guidance during a chaotic shift (\"Baghdad\" mode).  She is also a certified Emergency Medical Technician.\n\nUnderneath her no-nonsense exterior, Maggie is compassionate and protective of her nurses and the doctors and staff on her shift, often looking out for them as well. In season 1 she and April made sure the then-pregnant Dr. Manning did not overwork and was her \"birthing partner\". She also looks out for rookie resident Dr. Reese and frequently reminds her to \"go home\" or \"get some sleep\". The doctors sometimes use her as a \"sounding board\" and vent to her after a difficult shift.\n\nIn the episode \"Natural History\", it is revealed that she comes from a large and close-knit extended family and has a sister, Denise who was male at birth, had gender confirmation surgery and moved to Dallas, Texas.\n\nAs seen in \"Be My Better Half\", Maggie is fluent in American Sign Language, enough to understand and translate for a deaf patient.\n\nDr. Ava Bekker\n\nPortrayed by Norma Kuhling\n\nDr. Ava Bekker is a cardiothoracic surgeon from South Africa with whom Dr. Rhodes begins to butt heads on professional boundaries.\n\nIn season 4, Ava becomes an attending in the CT department. She and Dr. Rhodes also have a brief romantic relationship, which ends poorly.\n\nOver the course of the fourth season, Bekker successfully solicits a donation from Rhodes’ father to fund his hybrid OR project, becomes exposed to HIV when Rhodes’ scalpel cuts her hand during an operation, and performs a valve replacement on Rhodes’ father, which subsequently fails. Rhodes becomes convinced that Bekker has deliberately manipulated events to ensure that the pair remain involved in each other's lives, although it appears throughout the season that he is simply paranoid, with all incidents having innocent explanations.\n\nHowever, when Rhode's father dies suddenly of an insulin overdose while recovering from a second surgery, Bekker tells Connor that his father will no longer get in the way of there relationship, apparently believing that his father was the only thing keeping them apart. Connor, appalled by this, rejects her, telling her it is too late, so she furiously leaves.\n\nIn season 5, when the authorities and Dr. Isidore Latham start an investigation of Cornelius' suspicious death, she tries to get her revenge on Connor by suggesting to them that Connor might be his father's killer. Realizing what she's doing, Connor starts arguing with her more and more, until Latham, seeing their animosity declares he's close to solving the case; therefore, Bekker admits to Connor that she murderered his father in an effort to win him back and then commits suicide by slitting her own throat with a scalpel. A horrified Connor and Latham attempt to save her but is too late.\n\nDr. Crockett Marcel\n\nPortrayed by Dominic Rains\n\nDr. Crockett Marcel is a trauma surgeon fellow who eventually replaces Dr. Connor Rhodes after he resigns from Med for a fresh start. He gets suspicious of Phillip Davis after noticing that Dr. Natalie Manning didn't have a wedding ring on her when she was brought in the ER after being hit by a car. He later revealed this to Will Halstead.\n\nDr. Dean Archer\nPortrayed by Steven Weber\n\nDr. Dylan Scott\n\nPortrayed by Guy Lockard\n\nDr. Dylan Scott is the ED pediatrician. He is former Chicago police officer who switched careers to medicine.\n\nDr. Stevie Hammer\n\nPortrayed by Kristen Hager\n\nDr. Stevie Hammer is an attending in the Emergency Department who went to med school with Will Halstead.\n\nRecurring\n\nNotes\n\nFamily members\nNoah Sexton (Roland Buck III) is an emergency medicine resident and younger brother of April. It is implied in a conversation Severide had with April that Noah is the \"golden boy\" of the family who got to go to medical school with his sister's financial assistance despite April being the more academically inclined of the siblings. He has a torrid start to his rotation at Chicago Med and is quickly intimidated after following the residents on shift at the Emergency Department. He resorts to using Reese's ideas to earn Dr. Choi's favor, but she finds out about it and gives him a cold shoulder. He is fired by Dr. Choi after he committed a medical negligence.\nCornelius Rhodes (D. W. Moffett) was the father of Dr. Connor Rhodes. He runs the family business Dolen Rhodes, a high-end department store started by his father. His wife Elizabeth died at some point before the pilot. As the only son and heir to the family fortune, Connor was expected to follow his father into the family business but eschews it for medicine. Elizabeth's death and Connor's choice to go into medicine lead to a bitter estrangement between father and son. In season 4, he was hospitalized for a heart failure, but later was killed when Dr. Ava Bekker overdosed him with insulin. Connor learned the truth about his parents' relationship—and that his mother wasn't the ideal he made her out to be in his grief over her death—just too late to reconcile with Cornelius.\nClaire Rhodes (Christina Brucato) is the estranged sister of Connor. In season 1 she takes her co-worker and friend Russell to the hospital after he gets impaled from broken chandelier shards after he saves her from the falling chandelier. After Connor takes Russell into surgery she and her brother talk, which she still angrily blames him for leaving her with their father and eventually dismisses him, telling Connor to take care of her friend. Later she and Connor speak to their father about using SNAP on Russell, which she insists on paying for it but Cornelius disagrees.\nRobin Charles (Mekia Cox) is Dr. Charles' daughter, also a doctor, who worked as epidemiologist in the Med during season 2 and had a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. She left to be with her mother in Minneapolis in season 3, but returned in season 4 episode \"We Hold These Truths\".\nAnna Charles (Scarlett Wand in Season 2 and Hannah Riley in Season 5 and 6) is Dr. Charles' second daughter with his second ex-wife Susan. She is a teenage girl who deals with typical teenage problems. In Season 6, she suffers a pregnancy scare and her father stands by her side. After a custody battle, her mother wins but Anna didn't want to leave her father, forcing Daniel to tell Susan of the pregnancy and Susan allows Daniel to retain custody.\nHelen Manning (Annie Potts) is the mother-in-law of Dr. Natalie Manning and paternal grandmother of Owen. She is on good terms with Natalie, having been there for her since the death of her son Jeff and acts as an occasional babysitter for her grandson. Helen was initially disapproving of Will but had to rely on him to keep her family in Chicago.\nEmily Choi (Arden Cho) is the sister of Dr. Ethan Choi. Unlike her brother, Emily is much more free-spirited but her reckless behavior has landed her into trouble with alcohol and drugs. Dr. Choi clashes with his girlfriend April over how to deal with Emily. In season 4 she starts dating Bernard Kim (C. S. Lee), a much older man whom she had met at her AA meeting. She then tells Ethan that she's pregnant with Bernard's child and months later she gives birth to a boy which she names him Vincent after her and Ethan's late grandfather.\nRobert Haywood (Michael Gill) is a professor and the father of Dr. Sarah Reese. Sensing his possessive behavior, Dr. Charles investigated him and discovered some of his students went missing, leading him to realized that he might be a serial killer. After finding more evidence, Dr. Charles confronted Robert, causing him to have a heart attack from recent treatment for it. After he was treated and imprisoned, Sarah decided to leave Chicago to distant herself from her father and Dr. Charles.\nPatrick \"Pat\" Halstead (Louis Herthum) is the late father of Dr. Will Halstead and Detective Jay Halstead. He first appeared in the Season 2 episode \"Generation Gap\" when Jay calls Will from their childhood house about Pat's heart condition. Pat was later sent for open heart surgery at the end of the episode. According to the brothers, Pat disapproved of their career choices, leading to their estrangement for many years.

In the context of beer production, hops are commonly used to provide bitterness, flavor, and aroma. They act as a natural preservative and contribute to the stability and carbonation of beer. Some popular hop varieties used in brewing include 'Cascade', 'Centennial', 'Willmette', 'Chinook', 'Amarillo', 'Golding', and 'Saaz'.\n\nApart from their role in brewing, hops have also been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine. They have been used to treat insomnia, restlessness, indigestion, intestinal cramps, and lack of appetite. Hops possess properties that can regulate and balance hormonal activity, which may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions like breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. Additionally, hops have shown appetite-stimulating effects and have been used in treating anorexia. They can act as a milder and safer alternative to addictive sedatives due to their sedating properties without narcotic side effects. Hops also have a relaxing effect on the gastrointestinal tract, which can indirectly relax the central nervous system through the enteric nervous system.\n\nIn terms of the growth and cultivation of hops, they are hardy perennials in zones 3 and above. They are typically planted in spring or late summer and harvested from late summer to fall. Hops require full sun and well-drained, slightly acidic soil. It's important to note that hops plants are aggressive vines that can grow over 5 meters (16 feet) and necessitate time-consuming pruning and staking. The vine dies in winter, but the rhizomes (roots) survive, allowing hops to grow on new wood every year.\n\nI hope this information provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the common uses and effects of hops, as well as the specifics of their growth and cultivation. Let me know if you have any further questions!\n\n The malted barley comes from Great Western Malting in Pocatello, Idaho and their hops come from Washington.\n\n Most hops are sourced from Yakima Valley and water comes from the Cedar River watershed in the Cascade Mountains. Popular brews include Universale Pale Ale, Interurban IPA, and Abominable Winter Ale. The Bourbon Abominable Winter Ale won a bronze at the 2012 World Beer Cup. In 2014, the Summer Ale and Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star Ale both won silvers at the Great American Beer Festival.\n\n Also known as hop houses or hop kilns, hop barns were very common in areas of the United States where hops were grown. Hop barns were so common it was said that \"every other farm\" had one. In New York state's \"hop belt\" numerous hop barns were constructed between the early 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Ostego, Chenango, Madison, Oneida, Montgomery and Schoharie Counties were the primary areas contained within the hop belt. As hops production basically dwindled down to only Washington state, in the U.S., the remaining hop houses elsewhere have begun to disappear. Defunct hop kilns are found in areas where hops production is still ongoing, in Kent, England, for instance.\n\n Hop growers in the United States employ the use of a wide variety of pesticides in order to protect their crop from numerous forms of disease and predation. Powdery Mildew, Downy Mildew, Spider mites, and hop aphids are among many pests that negatively impact hop growth and output. Fungicide use is the most common treatment by hop growers, with plants receiving on average 8.3 applications per season. The nonprofit trade group Hop Growers of America is an advocate for Integrated Pest Management practices in hop farming. IPM in hop growing involves using a scientifically informed rotation of pesticides, growing a diverse variety of disease resistant cultivars, and practicing proper planting techniques to ensure minimal environmental and economic impact. Idaho, Oregon, and Washington all have laws preventing importation of hop roots from outside of the Pacific Northwest in order to prevent the spread of disease and pests. A joint university study between Washington State University and University of California Davis found that while remaining pesticide residues from hop flowers existed in beer, they were well within safe range of the EPA's Accepted Daily Intake level.\n\nQuestion: where do they grow hops in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Later productions eschewed much of the violence the 1940s and 1950s shorts were known for, and in several of the television shows Jerry was given a red bowtie and a kinder disposition in Tom & Jerry Kids. Tom and Jerry aren't always enemies; they have been known to team up on occasion. The first Tom and Jerry short/film that Jerry was in is Puss Gets the Boot, and the last is The Karate Guard, the 163rd Tom and Jerry film. Jerry has been on the Tom and Jerry film series from 1940 to the present.\n\n In 2001, a new television special titled Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat premiered on Boomerang. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a habitrail, is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not \"blame everything on the mouse\". In 2005, a new Tom and Jerry theatrical short, titled The Karate Guard, which had been written and directed by Barbera and Spike Brandt, storyboarded by Joseph Barbera and Iwao Takamoto and produced by Joseph Barbera, Spike Brandt, and Tony Cervone premiered in Los Angeles cinemas on September 27, 2005, as part of the celebration of Tom and Jerrys sixty-fifth anniversary. This marked Barbera's first return as a writer, director and storyboard artist on the series since his and Hanna's original MGM cartoon shorts, and last overall; he would die shortly after production ended. Director/animator, Spike Brandt was nominated for an Annie award for best character animation. The short debuted on Cartoon Network on January 27, 2006. The short was filmed in the standard Academy ratio and format.\n\n Gerald \"Jerry\" Mouse is a fictional character and one of the two titular main protagonists (the other being Tom Cat) in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's series of Tom and Jerry theatrical animated short films. Created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Jerry is a brown mute anthropomorphic house mouse, who first appeared as a mouse named Jinx in the 1940 MGM animated short Puss Gets the Boot. Hanna gave the mouse's original name as \"Jinx\", while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance.\n\n Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the rivalry between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters. In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958. During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most \n\n The name \"Jerry\" was chosen by Geraint Rowlands, who submitted \"Tom and Jerry\" as potential names for the duo after an important Loews Inc. distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to Puss Gets the Boot. While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s, Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected cat and mouse relationship. Instead of being a \"cowering victim\" of Tom, he took delight in besting, and even torturing, his feline frenemy (even if Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry).

The country has the fourth-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Nigeria, Angola, and South Sudan. Buseruka Subcounty in Hoima District has been selected to be the location of Uganda's only oil refinery. The country's strategy is to build a refinery that meets the petroleum products needs of Uganda and its regional neighbors and to export the rest of crude oil production via a pipeline to Lamu. From the beginning, the preference of the Ugandan government had been to start with a small production capacity refinery to prolong the production longevity of its new oil discoveries. Initially, this preference conflicted with the wishes of the three major exploration companies in the country, which preferred rapid harvesting and export of the crude via pipeline to the Kenyan coast. After much recrimination, in April 2013 the government agreed with Tullow Oil of the United Kingdom, Total SA of France, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) to build both the oil refinery and the pipeline.\n\n Algeria is a regional power in North Africa, and a middle power in global affairs. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's sixteenth-largest oil reserves and the ninth-largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria's military is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member.\n\n Angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in sub-Saharan Africa, surpassing Nigeria in the 2000s. In January 2007 Angola became a member of OPEC. By 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep-water offshore oil fields. Oil sales generated US$1.71 billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80% of the government's budget, a 5% increase from 2003, and 45% of GDP. Chevron Corporation produces and receives 400 koilbbl/d, 27% of Angolan oil. Total S.A., ExxonMobil, Eni, Petrobras and BP also operate in the country. Block Zero provides the majority of Angola's crude oil production with 370 koilbbl/d produced annually. The largest fields in Block Zero are Takula (Area A), Numbi (Area A), and Kokongo (Area B). Chevron operates \n\n Currently, Algeria is one of the largest natural gas producers in what is known as the Arab World behind Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Algeria is also the leading gas exporter in Africa with energy supply relationships with France, Spain, Italy, United States and China. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that Algerian crude oil reserves amount to about 12.2 billion barrels but Algeria could potentially double its oil and gas production in the next ten years as the Sahara is a largely unexplored territory. Today, oil revenue accounts for about 20% of Algeria’s gross domestic product and about 85% of the country’s total exports. Algeria still owns SONATRACH which is Africa's largest gas producer and the bulk of Algerian oil still comes from the Hassi Messaoud and the Edjele oil fields which were the two major oil fields in 1956\n\n Africa has a large quantity of natural resources, including diamonds, sugar, salt, gold, iron, cobalt, uranium, copper, bauxite, silver, petroleum, and cocoa beans, but also tropical timber and tropical fruit...... Recently discovered oil reserves have increased the importance of the commodity on African economies. Sudan and Nigeria are two of the main oil producers. The United States and European countries took most of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) oil production. Oil is provided by both continental and offshore productions. Sudan's oil exports in 2010 are estimated by the United States Department of State at US$9 billion. Five countries dominate Africa's upstream oil production. Together they account for 85% of the continent's oil production and are, in order, from highest to lowest output: Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Angola. Other African oil producing countries are Gabon, the DRC, Cameroon, Tunisia, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, and more recently, Ghana. Exploration is taking place in a number of other countries that aim to increase their output or become first-time producers. Included in this list are Chad, Sudan, Namibia, South Africa, and Madagascar, whilst Mozambique and Tanzania are potential oil producers.\n\nQuestion: in which regions are most of africa petroleum and natural gas found\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Shapes can range from minor aberrations to distinctly ovoid, curved, pinched, or lumpy shapes. Most cultured freshwater pearls are baroque because freshwater pearls are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical, nucleation bead. The most valuable baroque pearls are the South Sea and the Tahitian pearls, which are produced by Pinctada margaritifera (black-lipped oysters) and Pinctada maxima (gold-lipped and white-lipped oysters). Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the depth of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl. Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, which, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls. Western Australia is currently the world's largest cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima gold-lipped oysters, whereas Tahiti is the number one cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima black-lipped oysters.\n\n pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural pearls form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell. The two methods of culturing pearls insert either \"seeds\" or beads into oysters. The \"seed\" method uses grains of ground shell from freshwater mussels, and overharvesting for this purpose has endangered several freshwater mussel species in the southeastern United States. The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs.  Other luxury and high-status products were made from molluscs. Tyrian purple, made from the ink \n\n Pearling in Bangladesh has existed for centuries. Bangladesh is famous for natural pink pearls, locally known as “mukta”. They are collected from a species of freshwater mussels which are found in abundance in inland bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, ponds and dams. Pearl farming takes place mainly in the southeastern region of the country, in an area stretching from Comilla District to the coastal Cox's Bazar District. The port city of Chittagong is a historic center of the pearl trade. Bengali river gypsies, people who live in houseboats, are traditionally engaged in pearl farming. Bangladeshi pearl production is small compared to other major producers. The domestic jewelry industry is focused on gold and silver.\n\n Pinctada margaritifera, commonly known as the black-lip pearl oyster, is a species of pearl oyster, a saltwater mollusk, a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Pteriidae. This species is common in the Indo-Pacific within tropical coral reefs. The ability of P. margaritifera to produce pearls means that the species is a valuable resource to humans. The oysters are harvested wild from coral reefs and are also commonly grown in aquaculture, both primarily taking place in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n Pinctada radiata, commonly known as the Atlantic pearl-oyster or the Gulf pearl oyster is a species of pearl oyster distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific. Its range extends as far north as Japan and as far south as the Australian state of Victoria.\n\nQuestion: in which sea pearl is found in india\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Institutes in China, for instance, the China Research and Conservation Centre for the giant panda, Wolong (卧龍) and the Chengdu (成都) Research base of giant panda Breeding have successfully breed many giant pandas' infants. ; 4) As some of the people living in this forest are usually poor and rely on the pandas' habitat areas for food, the conservation program is designed to help improve the livelihood of those people, and educate them to protect the natural reserves for the pandas. Due to deforestation for agricultural landuse, the pandas are forced to migrate high up to the mountains. In the last two decades, the area of pandas' habitat has dropped by 50%. Now their habitat occupies only a total area of 14,000 km2, where they have a low reproductive rate. Institutional policies to protect the giant panda population:\n\n An An (born 1986 ) is a male giant panda residing in Hong Kong Ocean Park, a gift from the Central People's Government of China to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1999.

In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable rather than endangered. While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role.

Although Gas Exporting Countries Forum has seen by some experts as an attempt to form 'gas-OPEC', Attiyah ruled out a creation of OPEC-like cartel. On 18 January 2011 he was named head of the Amiri Diwan while remaining in the post of the deputy prime minister. In the post of minister of industry and energy he was replaced by Mohammed Saleh Al Sada. In 2011, Attiyah was appointed head of former Emir Hamad Al Thani's office and president of the Qatar Administrative Control and Transparency Authority. During the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha, Attiyah served as the chairman.\n\n  Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an OPEC member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had 160 Tcuft of proven natural-gas reserves. It also ranks 16th in oil reserves. Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To \n\n Kubba was appointed Deputy Minister of Petroleum in 1960. He played a crucial role in launching the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries (OPEC). With his contacts during his experience throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Mr. Kubba was able to assist and formalize OPEC. Being an Iraqi initiative, the Organization was then inaugurated in Baghdad. At first, OPEC comprised Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and Venezuela only. Mr. Kubba became Iraq’s first delegate to OPEC and represented Iraq numerous times between 1960-1966. After 1960, he attended OPEC meetings in Switzerland (OPEC HQ between 1961-1965) and Vienna (OPEC HQ 1965–present) while representing Iraq. In 1966, Mr. Kubba was OPEC conference president, being the first official conference president \n\n The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was founded by five oil producing countries at a Baghdad conference on September 14, 1960. The five founding members of OPEC were Venezuela, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait. OPEC was organized after the oil companies slashed the posted price of oil, but the posted price of oil remained consistently higher than the market price of oil between 1961 and 1972. In 1963, the Seven Sisters controlled 86% of the oil produced by OPEC countries, but by 1970 the rise of \"independent oil companies\" had decreased their share to 77%. The entry of three new oil producers—Algeria, Libya and Nigeria—meant that by 1970, 81 oil companies were doing business in the Middle East. In the early 1960s Libya, Indonesia and Qatar joined OPEC. OPEC \n\n  OPEC is an alliance among 14 diverse oil-producing countries (as of January 2019: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela) to manage the supply of oil. OPEC's power was consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s as various countries nationalized their oil holdings, and wrested decision-making away from the \"Seven Sisters\" (Anglo-Iranian, Socony, Royal Dutch Shell, Gulf, Esso, Texaco, Socal), and created their own oil companies to control the oil. OPEC often tries to influence prices by restricting production. It does this by allocating each member country a quota for production. Members agree to keep prices high by producing at lower levels than they otherwise would. There is no way to enforce \n\nQuestion: how many countries are a part of opec\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Gladiator is unique in that it is the only truck available with a convertible folding soft top. A front facing trail cam, mounted in one of the front grille slots, is also available that displays an image on the touchscreen of what is directly in front of the vehicle (this feature requires one of the two larger U Connect touchscreen displays), and will assist in off-road maneuverability, such as water fording, as well as climbing over objects like logs and rocks. The \"Off Road Pages\" application, displayed in the instrument cluster, allows a Gladiator driver to view approach and departure angles, steering angles, and more.\n\n At the 2020 Chicago Auto Show, Jeep introduced the Gladiator Mojave. The Mojave is the first \"Desert-Rated\" Jeep model. Features on the Mojave trim include 33-inch Falken Wildpeak all-terrain tires (mud-terrain tires are also available as an option), unique seventeen-inch painted aluminum-alloy wheels, FOX brand 2.5-inch internal bypass shocks with external reservoirs, a unique \"Desert Rated 4X4\" emblem in place of the \"Trail Rated 4X4\" emblem on both front fenders, unique \"Mojave\" decals on both sides of the hood, orange tow hooks, an \"Off Road Plus\" button on the center console for increased off-road capabilities, and the ability to lock the Gladiator's rear axles at high speeds when in 4WD High mode (a feature exclusive to the Mojave). The interior, when equipped with the optional leather-trimmed seats, features special heat-reflective seating material that is engineered to withstand the hottest climates (all interiors on the Mojave feature unique orange stitching on the seats, steering wheel, dashboard, and door trim panels).\n\n Jeep previewed the fifth generation Cherokee in February 2013, shortly after the releasing the Compass, Patriot, and Grand Cherokee. The Cherokee debuted at the New York International Auto Show on  March 27, 2013. The North American market saw the Cherokee nameplate for the first time since the 2001 departure of the Cherokee (XJ). Other markets retained the Cherokee name with the introduction of the Liberty in the North American markets. The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to use the Fiat Compact Wide platform, which was co-developed by Chrysler and Fiat. It features a wheelbase of 106.3 in, 1.1 in longer than the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 5.1 in longer than its predecessor, the Jeep Cherokee XJ, and 2.7 in shorter than the original Jeep Cherokee (SJ). The Jeep Cherokee can be equipped with three different four-wheel drive systems: Active Drive I, Active Drive II, and Active Drive Lock. All of these systems come with Jeep's Selec-Terrain traction control system and rear-axle disconnect feature. The rear axle disconnect feature, a first for Compact SUV, disconnects the rear-axle when four-wheel drive is not needed. This lowers parasitic drivetrain load; which improves fuel efficiency.\n\n The Jeepster Commando is an automobile which was first produced by Kaiser Jeep in 1966 to compete with the International Scout, Toyota Land Cruiser and Ford Bronco. Four different models were available: a pickup truck, convertible, roadster and wagon. The Jeepster remained in production after American Motors Corporation (AMC) bought the Jeep line from Kaiser in 1970. After AMC's acquisition, the Jeepster Commando C101 (101\" wheelbase) steadily grew in popularity. In 1972, AMC shortened the vehicle's name to Commando C104, extended the wheelbase to 104\", and changed the front-end design to accept the AMC I6 and V8 304ci, similar to the Ford Bronco. The new configuration, formerly an AMC best seller, quickly caused the line to drop in popularity and was taken out of production in 1973; it was replaced with the full size Cherokee. The Jeepster is an ancestor of the modern Jeep family produced by Chrysler. There are several Jeepster enthusiast clubs across the United States. Willys-Overland, the original producers of the \"Jeep\" (originally manufactured for military use), also produced a \"Jeepster\" from 1948 until about 1950. This vehicle led to the later Kaiser productions.\n\n The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a range of mid-size SUVs produced by the American manufacturer Jeep. While some other SUVs were manufactured with body-on-frame construction, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has always used a unibody chassis.\n\nQuestion: what type of car is a jeep considered\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams (New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves) while simultaneously playing in the NFL.  After defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the Washington Redskins. In the 1991 NFL Draft, the Falcons selected quarterback Brett Favre as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the Green Bay Packers. In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.\n\n Sanders, Humphrey, Andersen, and Gonzalez are the only players in the Hall of Fame that have been inducted based substantially on their service with the Falcons. Andersen spent eight of his 25 NFL seasons with the Falcons, previously being the team's all-time scoring leader, but he also played his first 13 NFL seasons with the New Orleans Saints, leading that team's career scoring list.\n\n The Lions selected Sanders in the third round of the 1968 NFL Draft, and he became their starting tight end for the next ten seasons. He had 336 career receptions for 4,817 yards and 31 touchdowns. He was also known as a superior blocker. Sanders was chosen for the Pro Bowl seven times (1968–71, 1974–76). He was the only rookie to be named to the 1969 Pro Bowl, following a season where he had forty receptions for 533 yards. Sanders was also selected as a first-team All-Pro for the 1970 and 1971 seasons, receiving the most votes of any player in both years. During an exhibition game in 1976, he injured his right knee, but continued to play until his retirement at age 31 in November 1977. Sanders was named to the NFL 1970s All-Decade Team as selected by voters of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Minnesota M Club Hall of Fame in 2013.

However, on 4 March 2011 it was announced that Manchester City Council had backed out of plans to fund the new stadium with grants, despite the fact that the previously agreed £1.5 million was close to being raised by fans, and F.C. United moved to search for other sites. Despite this the Council stated that they were still committed to helping F.C. United build a ground in Manchester and on 5 April 2011 it was announced that, after considering three possible alternative sites, Ronald Johnson Playing Fields in Moston was the preferred location for the stadium to be built according to Manchester City Council.\n\n F.C. United were formed in 2005 by a group of Manchester United supporters following the club's controversial takeover by Malcolm Glazer which led to hundreds of supporters defecting from the club. Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set aspirations to build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council to develop their plans.

United formed in 2005, and aimed to construct a ground in Manchester by 2012. After plans for an initial site collapsed, the development of a new ground in Moston was announced. A protracted planning process followed, and construction began in November 2013. Broadhurst Park was completed with a capacity of 4,400 in May 2015. The opening match was a friendly between F.C.

Smith and was produced by Jambalaya Studios. Before its premiere, it was originally piloted for Disney's One Saturday Morning, then Nickelodeon, until it was eventually picked up by Disney Channel and started airing in September 2001. An original pilot was made and produced by Nickelodeon in 1998 but was never shown to the public resulting in Nickelodeon passing the show on. Some of the later episodes of The Proud Family were produced using Adobe Flash. Michael Peraza was the show's art director.

This meant that they had started earning money as well as their commercial success once again started increasing. In hearing this, Decca, who had been keeping \"Goin' Out Of My Head\" in their vaults for around half a year, decided to release it. So on 17 March 1967, \"Goin' Out Of My Head\" was released in the UK. As their contract with Parrot Records had expired, the song never got a release in the US. It was backed by \"She Does Everything For Me\", which was a song \n\n \"Get Out My Head\" is a song by Irish DJ and producer Shane Codd, who wrote and produced the song. Featuring uncredited vocals from Solah, it was released on 25 May 2020 by Polydor Records. \"Get Out My Head\" peaked at number five on the Irish Singles Chart. Outside Ireland, the single peaked within the top ten of the charts in the United Kingdom.\n\n \"Goin' Out of My Head\" is a song written by Teddy Randazzo and Bobby Weinstein, initially recorded by Little Anthony and the Imperials in 1964. Randazzo, a childhood friend of the group, wrote the song especially for them, having also supplied the group with their previous Top 20 Hit \"I'm on the Outside (Looking In)\". Their original version of the song was a Billboard Top 10 Pop smash, reaching No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 in the Canadian RPM-list in 1965. The song peaked at No. 8 on Cashbox magazine's R&B chart (Billboard was in a chart recess for R&B listings at that time). The Little Anthony and the Imperials original recording is the best-known version of the song, although it has since been covered by many other artists, including the Zombies, who released a rendition as their last single on Decca Records.\n\n My Head sold over three million copies worldwide to become the world's second highest selling single in 2001. Her co-written single \"I Kissed a Girl\" by Katy Perry also hit No. 1 in the USA. \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" also won Dennis an Ivor Novello Award as 2001's most performed composition. She won the same award in 2003 for \"Anything Is Possible\". In the USA, Dennis has received awards from Billboard, Grammy for compositions with Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears. Dennis co-wrote the Pop Idol theme (re-used for numerous international remakes of the show, including American Idol), and many Idol contestants have recorded her songs, including Will Young, Gareth Gates, \n\n Dennis has achieved critical and commercial success as a songwriter, winning a number of award-winning songs and penning many international hit singles. She has also contributed backing vocals to many of these recordings. Dennis has provided songs for Simon Fuller acts such as the Spice Girls, S Club 7 and the Idol franchise contestants where she co-wrote \"Bumper to Bumper\", the B-side to the Spice Girls' first hit single \"Wannabe\". Her highest-selling composition, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" (recorded by Kylie Minogue), spent four weeks at number one in Britain while also rekindling interest in Minogue in America (where it hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100).

In modern Catholic thought, the rose window is often associated with the Virgin Mary because one of her titles, referred to by St Bernard of Clairvaux, is the \"Mystical Rose\". However, the specific association of Mary with the rose window is unlikely during the Medieval period, because the term \"rose window\" was not coined until the 17th century, a time when few such windows were being constructed. However, with the revival of the Gothic style in the 19th and 20th centuries, much stained glass that was installed in rose windows, both in new churches and as restoration in old churches, was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\n A devotional image enshrined at the Maria Rosenberg Church in Waldfischbach-Burgalben, Germany, holds an 1138 painting of Mary, featuring roses. John Henry Newman said,\"Mary is the most beautiful flower ever seen in the spiritual world. It is by the power of God’s grace that from this barren and desolate earth there ever sprung up at all flowers of holiness and glory; and Mary is the Queen of them all. She is the Queen of spiritual flowers; and therefore, is called the Rose, for the rose is called of all flowers the most beautiful. But, moreover, she is the Mystical or Hidden Rose, for mystical means hidden.\" Roses have long been connected with Mary, the red rose symbolic of love, the white rose, of purity. In \n\n  Various folk cultures and traditions assign symbolic meaning to the rose, though these are seldom understood in-depth. Examples of deeper meanings lie within the language of flowers, and how a rose may have a different meaning in arrangements. Examples of common meanings of different coloured roses are: true love (red), mystery (blue), innocence or purity (white), death (black), friendship (yellow), and passion (orange).\n\n fifth century, Coelius Sedulius referred to Mary as a \"rose among thorns\". Known as the “queen of flowers”, the rose represents Mary as Queen of Heaven. Medieval writers also referenced a passage from Sirach 24:14 \"like a palm tree in Engedi, like a rosebush in Jericho\". Bernard of Clairvaux said, \"Eve was a thorn, wounding, bringing death to all; in Mary we see a rose, soothing everybody's hurts, giving the destiny of salvation back to all.\" Mary is celebrated under the title \"Our Lady of the Rose in Lucca, Italy on January 30. Roses feature prominently in the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote a poem called, \"Rosa Mystica\"; Chrysogonus Waddell composed an a capella choral piece of the same name.\n\n The rose in an allegorical sense appears many times in literature. In William Blake's poem \"The Sick Rose\" the rose is a symbol for love or passion, it is crimson and dark but now sick, the worm has infected it. The rose in the popular 13th-century French poem \"Romance of the Rose\" is a personification of the woman, the object of the lover's attentions, and his plucking of the rose represents his conquest of her. In the title of William Faulkner's short story \"A Rose for Emily\" the rose has a number of possible meanings: as Emily's lover now dried and preserved, or a secret as per sub rosa. In a postscript to The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco discusses the reason behind the title to his 1983 novel: \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".\n\nQuestion: who is rose in the fall season 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

But it conveys also the ambivalence of the 1980s period of perestroika in which it was written. The scene is set within an anthropomorphized city of Moscow with corrupt bureaucracy, dilapidated buildings, and a climate that is cold and grey for much of the year. But there is also charm in the ramshackle wooden houses and their overgrown gardens; the city is filled with testaments to a glorious past, and the population meets the banality of everyday life with humour and passion. Just like Moscow, Fitzgerald's characters are full of contradictions - rebellious, yet submissive, lecherous yet ascetic, corrupt yet \n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" explores several themes and issues that are relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape. One prominent theme in the novel is the pursuit of the American Dream. The American Dream represents the belief that anyone can achieve success and prosperity through hard work and determination. However, Fitzgerald's portrayal of the American Dream in \"The Great Gatsby\" reveals its limitations and challenges the notion that it is equally accessible to everyone. The novel depicts the vast income inequality that existed in the 1920s and highlights how the American Dream is often only attainable for a fortunate few, while remaining out of reach for the majority.\n\nAnother theme explored in the novel is the corrupting influence of wealth and materialism. Fitzgerald delves into the extravagance and decadence of the Jazz Age, portraying a society that is obsessed with wealth, glamour, and social status. Through characters like Jay Gatsby and the Buchanans, he critiques the emptiness and moral decay that can accompany the relentless pursuit of wealth and the superficiality of material possessions.\n\nFurthermore, \"The Great Gatsby\" delves into the complexities of love and desire. The novel examines the illusions and fantasies that can be constructed around love, particularly in relation to the character of Gatsby and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan. Fitzgerald explores themes of unattainable love, longing, and the disillusionment that can occur when reality fails to live up to romantic ideals.\n\nIn addition to these themes, Fitzgerald's novel offers a critique of the social hierarchy and class divisions that were prevalent in American society during the 1920s. He shows how social status and wealth can determine one's place in society and influence personal relationships. The novel also touches on themes of identity, loneliness, and the loss of innocence.\n\nOverall, \"The Great Gatsby\" is a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes and issues relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape. It examines the limitations of the American Dream, critiques materialism and the corrupting influence of wealth, and delves into the complexities of love, desire, and social hierarchy. Fitzgerald's novel continues to resonate with readers today, offering insights into timeless human experiences and societal issues.\n\n  Love and Glory (ISBN: 0-385-29261-9) is a 1983 novel by Robert B. Parker. The story is told in the first person by Boone Adams. It is a coming-of-age and love story. There is explicit and implicit reference to and imitation of The Great Gatsby. Parker originally intended a combination novel and time capsule. The time capsule sections, inter-chapter devices with baseball box scores, old ad copy, captions from LIFE magazine and popular song lyrics, were ultimately scrapped due to excessive permission fees. Much of the novel takes place at the fictional Taft University, which Parker used later as the setting for the 1989 Spenser novel Playmates and where Susan Silverman teaches.\n\n An adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel about a talented young man from a poor background who strives to win the unattainable rich girl. Set on Long Island, the wealthy Daisy Buchanan falls in love with Jay Gatsby, an Army captain. While Gatsby fights in the war, Daisy is pressured by her family to marry Tom Buchanan, a man of their social set. Five years pass, and Gatsby now owns a huge estate on Long Island. Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, rents Gatsby's gate house for the summer. Gatsby hosts lavish parties and seeks to reconnect with Daisy.\n\n \"The Great Gatsby\" is an American television play broadcast live on June 26, 1958, as part of the second season of the CBS television series Playhouse 90. David Shaw wrote the teleplay, adapted from the novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Franklin Schaffner directed.

The two teams played eight postseason games during this period, including two NFC championship games. Between 1975 and 1980, the Cowboys faced the Rams in the playoffs five times in a six-year period. In both 1975 and 1978, the Cowboys won the NFC championship on the road in blowout fashion, only to be followed by close defeats at home in next year's divisional round. The 1980 Wild Card Round saw Dallas follow up last year's playoff defeat with another blowout victory. As of 2021, the Cowboys lead the all-time regular season series 14–13, but the Rams lead the all-time playoff series 5–4, having recently defeated the Cowboys in the 2018 Divisional Round.\n\n the first time in franchise history, they posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (17–0) and Philadelphia (24–0) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys' post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses. Dallas ended their playoff run after a hard divisional playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n The 2009 Dallas Cowboys season was the 50th anniversary for the team in the National Football League. It was the team's first season playing at Cowboys Stadium. Their victory over the Oakland Raiders on November 26 extended their Thanksgiving winning streak to four in a row and also ended a three-game losing streak to the Raiders. They also ended the Saints' bid for a perfect season after a 13–0 start with a 24–17 victory on December 19, 2009. The Cowboys earned a playoff spot on December 27 after beating the Washington Redskins 17–0. On January 3, 2010, the Cowboys clinched their division with a win over the Philadelphia Eagles, 24–0. In the wild-card round of the playoffs, the Cowboys once again defeated the Eagles, 34–14, to score their first playoff win since December 28, 1996 and finish the season sweep of all three games played against Philadelphia.

In the case of U.S. federal income taxes, civil penalties for willful failure to timely file returns and willful failure to timely pay taxes are based on the amount of tax due; thus, if no tax is owed, no penalties are due. The civil penalty for willful failure to timely file a return is generally equal to 5.0% of the amount of tax \"required to be shown on the return per month, up to a maximum of 25%. In cases where a taxpayer does not have enough \n\n Penalty for Failure to Timely File Return: If a taxpayer is required to file an income or excise tax return and fails to timely do so, a late filing penalty may be assessed. The penalty is 5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month) the return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. A minimum penalty of $435 may apply for returns over 60 days late. The minimum penalty is the lesser of $435 or 100% of the tax due on the return. Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay Tax: If a taxpayer fails to pay the balance due shown \n\n Taxpayers who fail to file returns, file late, or file returns that are wrong, may be subject to penalties. These penalties vary based on the type of failure. Some penalties are computed like interest, some are fixed amounts, and some are based on other measures. Penalties for filing or paying late are generally based on the amount of tax that should have been paid and the degree of lateness. Penalties for failures related to certain forms are fixed amounts, and vary by form from very small to huge. Intentional failures, including tax fraud, may result in criminal penalties. These penalties may include jail time or forfeiture of property. Criminal penalties are assessed in coordination with the United States Department of Justice.\n\n Certain types of returns, called \"information returns,\" do not require payment of tax. These include forms filed by employers to report wages (Form W-2) and businesses to report certain payments (Form 1099 series instructions). The penalty for failures related to these forms is a dollar amount per form not timely filed, and the amount of penalty increases with the degree of lateness. The current maximum penalty for these forms is $50. Many of the forms must be filed electronically, and filing on paper is considered non-filing. Late filing of returns of partnership income (Form 1065) can result in penalties of $195 per month per partner, up to a maximum of 12 months. Similar penalties may apply to an income tax return (Form 1120S) for an S corporation.\n\n the tax return by the due date (even if the reason of nonpayment is a bounced check), there is a penalty of 0.5% of the amount of unpaid tax per month (or partial month), up to a maximum of 25%. Penalty for Failure to Timely Pay After Issuance of Notice: If a taxpayer fails to pay any additional tax assessed by the IRS (usually as a result of an audit which can be avoided ) the taxpayer may be liable for a penalty equal to 0.5% for each month (or partial month) during which the failure continues, if the amount is not paid within 21 \n\nQuestion: who may be affected by monetary penalties imposed by the irs\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She comes from a long family history of breast cancer with both her mother and older sister having been similarly diagnosed. She talks about the importance of getting second opinions and how that convinced her to have a lumpectomy followed by radiation versus a double mastectomy. Meg was lucky to have a strong network of friends and family that helped her through her journey. She now works for the Cancer Support Community to aid those less fortunate.\nDr Williamson graduated form the USC School of Medicine in 1989, and completed her residency as chief resident in radiation oncology at USC in 1994. Dr Williamson talks about why her medical career became focused on breast cancer following the loss of her sister to the disease. In her in-depth interview, she talks about the importance of radiation and how it significantly reduces the rate of recurrence for her patients. You will learn about the preparation for radiation, the various forms of radiation therapy treatment and the side effects that a patient can expect with treatment.\nMy name is Meg. I’m 52.\nMy mother had breast cancer in her early 40's. My sister had breast cancer in her early 40's so I was a teenager when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I didn't know why she was going to the hospital. My parents didn't tell me and she had breast cancer. They told me that afternoon she had a single mastectomy. A year later she had a second mastectomy because the doctors back then said chances are if she had it on one side she's going to have it on the other so we're going to go and take the second one. And then a year later she had a hysterectomy and unfortunately for my mom she never really recovered from it all. But she was cancer-free for four or five years and then she had spinal cancer after that. The radiation zapped her spine so hard that she was handicapped the rest of her life and used crutches and a walker to get around and was never able to walk on her own again after the radiation.\nIt had a huge impact on her emotionally, severe depression, and a really hard thing because none of us understood what was going on with her. None of us understood it. We thought once the cancer is over you should be fine but she had a really hard time coming out of it, never really did.\nSo with my mom having breast cancer when I was so young, I was told that I needed to start doing detection early so I started having mammograms at age 30. I have a mammogram every six months and then I have a sonocine on the other six months and I've never missed an appointment and I never will.\nSo I started at 30 doing that, and then one day I went in for my regular mammogram and was called back a couple days later and they said they found calcifications on the right side and I needed to come back in for more pictures, and I thought today's the day, it's finally going to happen, and I went in a couple days later and they did an ultrasound and determined that there was a tumor and scheduled me for a biopsy right away.\nSo I went in a couple days later for a needle core biopsy and a day later it was confirmed that it was malignant.\nThen I had an MRI after that and I had more ultrasounds. The MRI showed another spot, another hot spot on my same breast on the right breast. I had a needle core biopsy the first time to confirm the first spot and then after the MRI, when we went to go check the second spot, that was an MRI-guided biopsy and that was I had to go into the tube and they had to do it from underneath, the biopsy it was very uncomfortable but they ended up being negative.\nAt 48 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was…it changed everything. It 's just a range of all emotions and very confusing, lots of choices, lots of doctors to talk to, lots of questions, lots of answers, lots of opinions, so my choices were a lumpectomy with radiation or the mastectomy. I was told that my survival rates would be the same. I chose the lumpectomy followed by radiation, and actually the reason I made that choice was because another doctor had said to me, and it was the best advice I got, was just get the tumor out, just go ahead and schedule the lumpectomy, and then get to pathology, and then you can always go back and have the mastectomy afterwards.\nI actually also could never say the word 'cancer'. I always called it 'my thing'. I couldn't use the word…I couldn't say the word. I called it 'my thing'.\nI followed this doctor's advice cause I was thinking I had to do either the lumpectomy or the mastectomy. I thought I had to make that decision right away but when this one doctor said to me just get the tumor out, get it out and figure it out afterwards. The decisions were lumpectomy versus double mastectomy. I was not going to do a single mastectomy. If I was going to do one, I was going to do both. I wasn't going to play around with it.\nAnd I did talk to every person I know who had breast cancer. I had a long phone conversation or lunch or dinner with every single one I had known who had it and what did they do; how did they make their choice; how did they make the decision; and I had a very good friend who had been diagnosed with the same kind of cancer I had just six months earlier, and she did the lumpectomy and radiation. That made perfect sense to me.\nWe scheduled the lumpectomy right away. It as a very emotional process…very emotional.\nI woke up from my surgery just sobbing hysterically, but I did wake up with my surgeon just holding my arm and rubbing my arm and just being there in my face, and she was really wonderful as I was sobbing.\nMy husband was with me every step of the way.\nRadiation was not painful. You start out your first radiation appointment and you get four tattoos. They go to mark the site for the camera, for the radiation, so I have four tattoos. They're here [motioning to upper right chest area]; they're here [motioning to lower area]; they're on my chest [motioning to center of chest]; and one's on my back [motioning to back]. Little tiny black tattoo dots.\nWhen you start radiation, you go into the bed and then in my case my position was arm up and here. You go into the room, change your clothes…you take your clothes off, you put your robe on, you go in. It's all very clinical. Nobody is looking at you. Nobody is even thinking about anything. And then they lay you down on the bed and then the radiation starts and it doesn't hurt. I did get very red and raw underneath my arms.\nAnd I was pretty good leading up to the start of radiation in terms of emotion. I don't think I cried a lot during the process because I was too busy making decisions and thinking about what I was doing. But when it came down to my daily appointment at radiation, every day I had to check in and go take my clothes off, or my shirt off, and lay down on the bed and put the cameras on me, I did not do well. I cried and cried and cried on the first few days of radiation. This is my life. I have to do this every day, for six weeks. It's not a big deal but it was more the reality that this is something that's happened. And my radiologist was wonderful. She said, I didn't think you'd do well with this, and she was right. I didn't like it. But once I got into the habit it was fine.\nIt was exhausting. My husband got up with our children every morning to get them ready for school so I got to sleep in every morning which was great. I did exercise a lot. I mean like every day…and then I would rest during the day. I had to put cream on my breast and kind of just air it out, let it air for a little while every day, and it was…it was okay. I was glad it was over but it was okay.\nMy doctors were wonderful. Every doctor was amazing. The radiologist was amazing. The mammogram lab was amazing. The breast center doctors were amazing. My surgeon is amazing; she is the most compassionate, wonderful doctor. And every doctor had time for me. I never felt rushed at any appointments. They all gave me their cell phones…you call me anytime you have a question. These doctors were all…everyone was amazing.\nMy tumor was…I was told contained. I was told the horses hadn't left the barn yet. After the pathology report came in and it turns out that the barn doors had actually opened, that the horses would have started to leave the barn had I waited much longer for the surgery, so knowing that I just felt so grateful that I was checked every six months and we acted on it right away.\nAnd because the horses had left the barn, I am on medication for five years. I did Tamoxifen for three years and now I take Femara every day, so I'm four years out. I only have one more year to go to get off of the medication.\nAfter I went through radiation, I did choose to have a hysterectomy because there were other signs happening. When they were giving me biopsies…my gynecologist was giving me biopsies..I thought I don't ever want to hear the word biopsy again, and when my gynecologist said if you get ovarian cancer there's nothing I can do for you, I said.. that's all he had to say to me is I said then let's do it. So I was very happy I did it.\nOur son was 15 at the time and a sophomore in high school. He didn't understand what was going on, and we didn't do a very good job explaining to him. And the way I found out that we hadn't done a good job explaining this to him was that on the last day of my radiation I sat at the dinner table and I said to my family I'm done, radiation's over, I've finished radiation. And my son looked at me said, so does that mean you don't have cancer anymore? And I thought, oh my gosh. He thought all this time that I still had the cancer and I just felt horrible. My husband and I looked at each other and just said how did we miss that one? It was really awful for him. His grades were falling at school. He thought all this time that I still had had the cancer, so for 12 weeks after the surgery he still thought that I had cancer, which breaks my heart.\nThe girls were 20 and 22. They're very fatalistic about this for them with their grandmother, their aunt, their mother, which is the same way I felt about cancer. That it was a matter of time. I think if anything we've learned through all this that with early detection is it's going to be fine; it's going to be fine; and the girls just need to stay on it and get checked every six months like I have; never miss an appointment; do the self-checks; and just have to stay on top of it.\nOur parents' generation did not have the support that we have and they didn't understand how important the support is, the emotional support is, to have when going through something like this. It's just not something you can do alone, and my mom did kind of go through it alone, and we as the kids didn't understand what was going on and how it impacts everything from now on. And so, no, my mother did not have the support system that Cancer Support provides and she could have really used Cancer Support Community. She would have loved Cancer Support Community. She could have really used it.\nI feel very lucky.

According to Redwood, legislative proposals outlined in a consultation document show that the EU intends to move to further centralise VAT policies having concluded that more flexibility on VAT for EU member countries could damage the single market, and any move to allow more flexibility on VAT rates would require the unanimous consent of the 28 countries and the European Parliament. Redwood has also argued that European Courts rulings have made it more difficult to levy corporation tax on some firms and amend tax codes.

The first ESPN Sunday night broadcast occurred on November 8, 1987, while the last one aired on January 1, 2006. Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credits ESPN with raising the \"profile\" of the league, by turning \"a potential six- or seven-hour television experience into a twelve-hour television experience,\" factoring in both Sunday Night Football and the network's pregame show Sunday NFL Countdown.\n\n Monday Night Baseball is a live game telecast of Major League Baseball that airs most Monday nights during the regular season on ESPN. The official name of the game is Monday Night Baseball presented by USAA. The game starts at 7 p.m. ET, following SportsCenter, and usually lasts around three hours leading up to an hour-long Baseball Tonight. The program sometimes airs on ESPN2 rather than ESPN, often due to NBA playoff coverage in April and May, and preseason Monday Night Football coverage in August. Unlike ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball, Monday Night Baseball is not exclusive, but unlike Wednesday Night Baseball, Monday Night Baseball since 2007 co-exists with the local markets' carriers and is not always subject to blackout; ESPN can show teams up to three times a year in local markets alongside the local broadcasts.\n\n shoulder injury, ending his streak of 297 consecutive regular season games; Tarvaris Jackson started in his place and subsequently Joe Webb had his first ever down in an NFL game.

It is scored for flute (in the second movement), 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns and strings. The opus was for a long time believed to be Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Symphony No. 37 in G major, K. 444/425a, but it is now known that Mozart only added an Andante maestoso introduction to Michael Haydn's symphony, \"an expressive prelude, which, moreover, is by no means entirely in key with the movement it is intended to prepare.\" The true authorship was discovered by Lothar Perger in 1907. The work is in three movements:  \n\n The concerto is in three movements: 1. Allegro 2. Andante in E major 3. Allegro The first movement is in typical sonata-allegro form. The middle movement consists of a theme and two variations. The finale is (as usual for Mozart) a sonata-rondo, although using a less-common ABACABA form. It is testimony to Mozart's greatness that although this movement is extremely difficult from a technical point of view, it never sounds like a 'showpiece' meant to display the performer's skills. Some of the demands made on the pianist include fast ascending-descending arpeggios, hand-crossing and voice highlighting in runs of semiquavers, wide jumps and towards the end a double-handed tremolo where the soloist 'battles against' the orchestra. This movement is among the most challenging works which Mozart has ever written for the keyboard. Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. Elaine Sisman has postulated that Mozart modeled the slow movement on a theme-and-variations movement from the Symphony No. 75 of Joseph Haydn.\n\n1) Adagio, – Allegro di molto, ; 2) Andante, in G major ; 3) Menuetto – Trio, (Trio in C minor) ; 4) Presto, in C minor and major ; 5) Adagio (di Lamentatione),  in F major ; 6) Finale: Prestissimo, The symphony is scored for two oboes, bassoon, two horns, two optional trumpets, timpani, and strings. The slow introduction to the first movement overture opens with a fanfare similar to the one that opens the 50th symphony which also served an overture to a stage work. The ensuing Allegro is in sonata form. The second theme has a section that is notably marked perdendosi (\"dying away\") which Sisman associates with the \n\n1) Allegro molto ; 2) Andante, in A minor ; 3) Menuetto e Trio, both in F major ; 4) Presto Michael Haydn's Symphony No. 20 in C major, Perger 12, Sherman 20, MH 252, written in Salzburg in 1777, is one of the few of his symphonies to have a slow movement in a minor key, and one of his few C major symphonies to not include trumpets or timpani. Scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns and strings, in four movements: \n\n1) Allegro, ; 2) Andante, ; 3) Menuetto and Trio, ; 4) Molto allegro, The symphony is in four movements, and is scored for two oboes, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings. The inclusion of trumpets and timpani is unusual for Mozart's early symphonies. It has been described as a \"ceremonial work\".  There are four movements:  The first movement begins with downward leaps on the violins and follows with scale figures. These sets of figures alternate between strings and winds. The second movement is for strings alone and begins with a narrow melodic range which expands toward the end. The third movement is a Minuet full of rapid string passages, and includes the trumpets and timpani, but not during the Trio. The final movement is a gigue, whose main theme unusually does not end the movement.\n\nQuestion: what is the form of mozart symphony no 40\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, and Kate Winslet. The story takes place in a dystopian and post-apocalyptic Chicago where people are divided into distinct factions based on human virtues. Beatrice Prior is warned that she is Divergent and thus will never fit into any one of the factions. She soon learns that a sinister plot is brewing in the seemingly perfect society.

He was the eldest but estranged son of King George II and Caroline of Ansbach, and the father of King George III. Under the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne at birth, after his great-grandmother, paternal grandfather and father. He moved to Great Britain following the accession of his father, and was created Prince of Wales. He predeceased his father, however, and upon the latter's death on 25 October 1760, the throne passed to Prince Frederick's eldest son, George III.\n\n The term crown prince is not used in European monarchies where the hereditary sovereign holds a title below that of king/queen or emperor/empress (such as grand duke or prince), although it is sometimes used as a synonym for heir apparent. In Europe, where primogeniture governed succession to all monarchies except those of the Papacy and Andorra, the eldest son or (more recently) eldest child of the current monarch fills the role of crown prince or princess, depending upon whether females of the dynasty enjoy personal succession rights. Male precedence has been abolished in Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The eldest living child of a monarch is sometimes not the heir apparent or crown prince, because that position can be held by a descendant of a deceased \n\n (d. 6 February 1952), Princess Elizabeth acceded to the throne as Queen Elizabeth II and moved to Buckingham Palace. Her mother, Queen Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret moved into Clarence House. Also at the start of her widowhood, the Queen Mother purchased the Castle of Mey in Scotland as a summer residence. Princess Margaret later moved into an apartment in Kensington Palace, whilst the Queen Mother remained at Clarence House and at the Castle of Mey, until her death in March 2002. Since 2002 (upon the death of The Queen Mother), Clarence House has been the London residence of Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Until their marriages in 2011 and 2018, respectively, it was the London residence of Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\n The title was created for a third time on 19 November 1947 by King George VI, who bestowed it on his son-in-law Philip Mountbatten, when he married Princess Elizabeth. Subsequently, Elizabeth was styled \"HRH The Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh\" until her accession in 1952. The subsidiary titles of the dukedom are Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich, of Greenwich in the County of London. Like the dukedom, these titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Earlier that year, Philip had renounced his Greek and Danish royal titles (he was born a Prince of Greece and Denmark, being a male-line grandson of King George I of the Hellenes and male-line great-grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark) along with his rights to the Greek throne. In 1957, Philip became a Prince of the United Kingdom. Upon Philip's death on 9 April 2021, his eldest son Charles, Prince of Wales, succeeded to all of his hereditary titles. The current heir apparent to the dukedom is Charles's eldest son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, although he will only inherit the title if Charles predeceases the Queen.\n\n Clarence House announced that, when Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall's husband Charles, Prince of Wales accedes to the throne of the United Kingdom, she will not use the legal style of queen consort. She intends to use the style of \"princess consort\", even though her husband would not be a sovereign prince but a sovereign king. Such a title has no historical precedent; under English common law, wives of kings automatically become queens. The Guardian reported in 2017 that experts expect \"the fiction will end when Elizabeth II dies\" and Camilla will be queen. Clarence House in 2018 removed the statement from its website, suggesting that Camilla will be styled as queen consort upon her husband's accession.

The hotel is situated right next to the Trident Hotel property close to NH-8, also under a management contract with Orbit Resorts. In January 2012, it became the first Indian luxury hotel to be named, \"the World's Leading Luxury Hotel for 2011\", at the annual 'World Travel Awards'. Previously in December 2011, CNNGo named it amongst, \"11 Indian hotels to visit in 2012\". The hotel restaurants include the 24-hour multi-cuisine Threesixtyone and Amaranta which serves speciality coastal Indian cuisine. The property also has a bar termed as 'The Piano Bar', a cigar lounge and a spa.\n\n Historically, the usual appearance of a Residence Inn was a main building, called the \"Gatehouse,\" which houses the front desk, a common area for meal service, an on-site coin-operated laundry, a swimming pool and exercise room and often several outbuildings similar to condo or apartment complexes. Most had exterior corridors. More recent constructions, however, have moved away from the outbuilding style and instead have a more traditional layout with all suites in the same building. The suites are much larger than traditional hotel rooms, however. They are typically around 450 square feet for a standard suite and 750 for a two-bedroom suite. Residence Inns typically feature a complimentary small hot breakfast in the morning and a complimentary reception on Monday through Wednesday evenings called \"The Mix\". The first Residence Inn to bear the Marriott name was in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The President has the rank of Magistrate of the Supreme Court and chairs over the Civil and Criminal Law Chamber. He or she is nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary for a tenure of five years. As well as the Supreme Court, each Magistrate of the High Court is nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary and appointed by the Monarch for a lifetime tenure up to the age of 70, when they must retire, although they can request a 2 years extension.\n\n The Supreme Court of Judicature consists of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal. The High Court is made up of the Chief Justice and between six and thirty-six puisine judges, and the Court of Appeal is made of up the Chief Justice and twelve Justices of Appeal. The judges have seniority according to their date of appointment and Justices of Appeal have precedence over High Court Justices. A judge cannot be appointed to the High Court unless they have been a member of the Bar of England and Wales or an attorney-at-law under the Legal Profession Act, 1986 for ten years. A judge cannot be appointed to the Court of Appeal unless he has been a judge of the former Supreme Court or High Court for three years, or has been a member of the Bar of England and Wales or an attorney-at-law for fifteen years. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President, with advice from the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition. Other judges are appointed by the President, in consultation with the Judicial and Legal Service Commission.\n\n criminal and civil matters, the Supreme Administrative Court does so in administrative matters. The Constitutional Court, on the other hand, is responsible for judicial review, the resolution of demarcation conflicts between the administrative and the judiciary and the impeachment of public officials. The court does not have a fixed number of members. As of the early 21st century, there are typically between fifty and sixty justices on the court; as of August 2018, the exact number of sitting judges is 61. The responsibility for appointing Supreme Court justices is vested in the President of Austria, but the President can and usually does delegate this task to the minister of justice. The minister picks from a shortlist of three nominees provided by the court itself. The Supreme Court of Justice convenes in the Palace of Justice in Vienna.\n\n Supreme Court (or \"Tribunal da Relacao\") judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president.

The sperm cell becomes a pronucleus after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic material of the sperm and egg fuse. Contrary to the sperm cell, the egg cell has a pronucleus once it becomes haploid, and not when the sperm cell arrives. Sperm and egg cells are haploid, meaning they carry half the number of chromosomes of somatic cells, so in humans, haploid cells have 23 chromosomes, while somatic cells have 46 chromosomes. The male and female pronuclei don't fuse, although their genetic material does. Instead, \n\nSuccessful fertilization is most likely to occur when the sperm reaches the oviduct and the egg has completed its second meiotic division. The oviduct, also known as the fallopian tube, is the site where fertilization typically takes place. After ovulation, the egg is released from the ovary and travels through the oviduct towards the uterus. Along this journey, if fertilization occurs, it usually happens within the ampulla or the widest part of the oviduct.\n\nFor fertilization to occur, the sperm needs to enter the oviduct and meet the egg. The sperm's journey towards the egg is facilitated by several factors such as the release of cervical mucus that allows sperm to swim more easily and the contraction of the fallopian tube muscles, which help move the sperm towards the egg.\n\nOnce the sperm reaches the oviduct, it must penetrate the egg's protective layer called the zona pellucida. This usually happens through a process known as the acrosome reaction, where enzymes released by the sperm help break down the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to reach the egg.\n\nAt this stage, the egg has completed its second meiotic division, resulting in the formation of a mature egg or oocyte. This is an essential step for successful fertilization since only mature eggs can be fertilized by sperm. The second meiotic division produces a polar body, which contains half the genetic material of the original egg. Once fertilization occurs, the genetic material of the sperm combines with the genetic material of the egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote.\n\nIn summary, successful fertilization is most likely to occur when the sperm reaches the oviduct and the egg has completed its second meiotic division. The oviduct provides the necessary environment for the sperm and egg to meet, allowing for the formation of a zygote and the beginning of pregnancy.\n\n(Because only sperm that have undergone capacitation are able to fertilize an egg, in IVF therapy the first stage of capacitation must be replicated in the laboratory prior to IVF if fertilization is to occur in the petri dish.)The egg still lies passively within the dish, as it would in the fallopian tube; but in the significantly reduced volume of the petri dish, the sperm are far more likely to find the egg than they would be if they had to negotiate the entire distance from the fornix. ### **How Fertilization Occurs**\n\nThe process whereby sperm are prepared to fertilize an egg, which is known as _capacitation_ , takes place in two stages. First, as a sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, slowly releasing the enzymes within the acrosome. Then, with its acrosome now exposed, the sperm attacks the cumulus granulosa and the zona pellucida (the shell-like covering) of the egg. The heads of a number of sperm fuse with the zona pellucida, and one successful sperm penetrates the egg. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. The sperm require from five to 10 hours of incubation in the fluids of the female reproductive tract to complete the acrosome reaction. Capacitation takes place in the mucus secretions of the cervical canal, and continues in the uterus and fallopian tubes. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. (Because only sperm that have undergone capacitation are able to fertilize an egg, in IVF therapy the first stage of capacitation must be replicated in the laboratory prior to IVF if fertilization is to occur in the petri dish.)The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg.Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation.\n\n• **Phase 2(b):** The acrosome fuses with the zona pellucida, thus completing capacitation.• **Phase 2(a):** The acrosomal enzymes are released, and penetrate the cumulus mass cells of the egg.First, as a sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, slowly releasing the enzymes within the acrosome. Then, with its acrosome now exposed, the sperm attacks the cumulus granulosa and the zona pellucida (the shell-like covering) of the egg. The heads of a number of sperm fuse with the zona pellucida, and one successful sperm penetrates the egg. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. The sperm require from five to 10 hours of incubation in the fluids of the female reproductive tract to complete the acrosome reaction. Capacitation takes place in the mucus secretions of the cervical canal, and continues in the uterus and fallopian tubes. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. (Because only sperm that have undergone capacitation are able to fertilize an egg, in IVF therapy the first stage of capacitation must be replicated in the laboratory prior to IVF if fertilization is to occur in the petri dish.) After the acrosome reaction has taken place, the successful sperm completes the fertilization process by burrowing through the zona pellucida and ooplasm to the nuclear material. The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg. Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation. • **Phase 2(a):** The acrosomal enzymes are released, and penetrate the cumulus mass cells of the egg. • **Phase 2(b):** The acrosome fuses with the zona pellucida, thus completing capacitation.The moment a sperm penetrates the egg's zona pellucida, a reaction in the egg fuses the zona and the perivitelline membrane into an impermeable shield that prevents other sperm from entering.When fertilization occurs, the egg starts dividing within the zona covering, drawing its metabolic supplies from the ooplasm within the egg.\n\nThe process by which a sperm fuses with the zona pellucida and completes capacitation involves several steps. \n\nFirst, as the sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, leading to the release of acrosomal enzymes. This exposes the acrosome, allowing the sperm to attack the cumulus granulosa and the zona pellucida of the egg.\n\nDuring this process, the heads of several sperm fuse with the zona pellucida. However, only one successful sperm will be able to penetrate the egg. This fusion of the sperm with the zona pellucida is known as the acrosome reaction, marking the completion of capacitation.\n\nThe acrosome reaction usually takes around five to 10 hours of incubation in the fluids of the female reproductive tract to complete. Capacitation primarily occurs in the mucus secretions of the cervical canal, but it continues in the uterus and fallopian tubes.\n\nIt is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary changes in the sperm's plasma membrane, enabling the release of acrosomal enzymes.\n\nAfter the acrosome reaction, the successful sperm continues the fertilization process by burrowing through the zona pellucida and ooplasm to reach the genetic material of the egg. Upon penetration, the sperm sheds its body and tail, with only the head containing the genetic material entering the egg.\n\nReplicating the first stage of capacitation in the laboratory is necessary in in vitro fertilization (IVF) therapy to ensure that only sperm that have undergone capacitation are used for fertilization in the petri dish.\n\nOverall, the process of sperm fusing with the zona pellucida and completing capacitation is a complex series of events that enable successful fertilization to occur.\n\nQuestion: name the process of fusion of an egg with a sperm\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The cornea is transparent and located at the front of the eye. It helps in focusing light onto the retina. The sclera, which is dull white in color, protects the internal structures of the eye and maintains the eye's shape. It also serves as the point of attachment for the extrinsic muscles that move the eye.\n\nThe uvea is a vascular pigmented layer that is attached to the sclera. It consists of three parts: the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. The choroid is a darkly pigmented vascular lining that supplies blood to the internal structures of the eyeball. It prevents light rays from escaping through the eyeball. The ciliary body is responsible for the production of aqueous humor, which helps nourish the eye. The iris controls the size of the pupil and regulates the amount of light entering the eye.\n\nThe retina is the innermost layer of the eyeball. It contains photoreceptor cells that detect light and convert it into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain. The retina plays a crucial role in vision by sending these signals to the brain via the optic nerve.\n\nOverall, these three main parts of the eyeball work together to facilitate vision by receiving, focusing, and transmitting visual information.\n\n Sattler's layer, named after Hubert Sattler, an Austrian ophthalmologist, is one of five (or six) layers of medium-diameter blood vessels of the choroid, and a layer of the eye. It is situated between the Bruch's membrane, choriocapillaris and Haller's layer below, and the suprachoroidea above, respectively. The origin seems to be related to a continuous differentiation throughout the growth of the tissue and even further differentiation during adulthood.\n\nThe wall of the eyeball is composed of three concentric layers. The outermost layer is known as the corneoscleral coat, which includes the transparent cornea and the white opaque sclera. The cornea covers the front portion of the eye and is continuous with the sclera, which forms the majority of the white of the eye.\n\nMoving inward, the middle layer is called the vascular coat or uvea. It consists of the choroid, which is a highly vascular layer providing nutrients to the retina. The choroid has a dark brown color due to the presence of blood vessels and melanin pigment. Its main function is to absorb scattered and reflected light, reducing glare within the eye.\n\nThe uvea also includes the stroma of the ciliary body and iris. The ciliary body is a ring-like thickening located just posterior to the corneoscleral junction. It extends inward and is responsible for producing the aqueous humor, which helps maintain the shape of the eye. The iris, on the other hand, is the colored part of the eye and controls the size of the pupil.\n\nThe innermost layer of the eyeball wall is the retina. It consists of the outer pigment epithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. The retina is responsible for converting light into neural signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. It is considered an extension of the central nervous system.\n\nIn summary, the three concentric layers that make up the wall of the eyeball are the corneoscleral coat (cornea and sclera), the vascular coat or uvea (choroid, ciliary body, and iris), and the inner photosensitive layer, the retina.\n\nReference:\n- The ciliary body is a ringlike thickening that extends inward just posterior to the level of the corneoscleral junction. The anterior rim of the uveal layer continues forward, where it forms the stroma of the ciliary body and iris.\n- The wall of the eyeball is organized in three separate concentric layers: an outer supporting layer, the corneoscleral coat; a middle vascular coat or uvea; and an inner photosensitive layer, the retina. The vascular coat, the middle layer, or uvea, includes the choroid and the stroma of the ciliary body and iris. The retina, the inner layer, includes an outer pigment epithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris.\n\nThe eye is composed of three concentric layers or coats. The outer layer, called the corneoscleral coat or fibrous layer, consists of the sclera and cornea. The sclera, sometimes referred to as the \"white\" of the eye, is a dense fibrous connective tissue that provides attachment for the extrinsic muscles of the eye. It forms the majority of the outer layer and gives the eye its shape and protection. The cornea, which is transparent, covers the anterior one-sixth of the eye and is continuous with the sclera.\n\nMoving inward, the middle layer is known as the vascular coat or uvea. It includes the choroid, the stroma of the ciliary body, and the iris. The choroid is a highly vascular layer that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the retina. It also contains pigments that help absorb excess light. The ciliary body, located behind the iris, is responsible for producing the aqueous humor and controlling the shape of the lens. The iris, which gives our eyes their color, controls the size of the pupil.\n\nThe innermost layer is called the retina. It consists of the outer pigment epithelium, the inner neural retina, and the epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that convert light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. The retina is continuous with the central nervous system and plays a crucial role in vision.\n\nIn summary, the three concentric layers of the eye include the corneoscleral coat (consisting of the sclera and cornea), the vascular coat or uvea (composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris), and the retina (comprised of the outer pigment epithelium, inner neural retina, and ciliary body/iris epithelium).\n\nReference:\n- The wall of the eye consists of three concentric layers or coats. The eyeball is composed of three structural layers: the corneoscleral coat, the outer or fibrous layer, the vascular coat, the middle layer, or uvea, and the retina, the inner layer.\n\nThe vascular layer of the eyeball, also known as the uvea, is composed of three parts: the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris. \n\nThe choroid is the posterior portion of the vascular layer and makes up approximately two-thirds of its structure. It is a thin, highly vascularized, and pigmented layer that lies between the retina and the sclera. The choroid supplies blood to the retina and helps nourish its cells with oxygen and nutrients.\n\nNext is the ciliary body, which extends from the anterior border of the choroid. It forms a complete ring around the eyeball and consists of the ciliary muscle and the ciliary processes. The ciliary muscle is made up of smooth muscle fibers arranged longitudinally, circularly, and radially. When the ciliary muscle contracts, it decreases the size of the ring formed by the ciliary body. This action allows for accommodation of the lens, enabling near vision. The ciliary processes are ridges on the inner surface of the ciliary body. They produce aqueous humor, a clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye, helping with maintaining intraocular pressure.\n\nLastly, there is the iris, which is the most anterior portion of the vascular layer. It is a thin, circular structure that determines the color of the eye. The iris contains muscles that regulate the size of the pupil, controlling the amount of light that enters the eye. The iris also helps in protecting the internal structures of the eye.\n\nOverall, the components of the vascular layer of the eyeball work together to provide nourishment to the retina, regulate the amount of light entering the eye, facilitate accommodation for near vision, and maintain intraocular pressure.\n\nReference: \"8.108).Completing the vascular layer of the eyeball anteriorly is the iris (Fig.Ciliary processes also contribute to the formation of aqueous humor.The lens therefore becomes more rounded (relaxed) resulting in accommodation of the lens for near vision.This reduces tension on the suspensory ligament of the lens.Continuous with the sclera anteriorly is the transparent cornea. It covers the anterior one-sixth of the surface of the eyeball and, being transparent, allows light to enter the eyeball. Vascular layer of the eyeball\\n\\nThe vascular layer of the eyeball consists of three continuous parts—the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris from posterior to anterior (Fig. 8.108). The choroid is posterior and represents approximately two-thirds of the vascular layer. It is a thin, highly vascular, pigmented layer consisting of smaller vessels adjacent to the retina and larger vessels more peripherally. It is firmly attached to the retina internally and loosely attached to the sclera externally. Extending from the anterior border of the choroid is the ciliary body (Fig. 8.108). This triangular-shaped structure, between the choroid and the iris, forms a complete ring around the eyeball. Its components include the ciliary muscle and the ciliary processes.\"\n\nQuestion: the vascular layer of the eye is the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1878, the Pact of Zanjón ended the conflict, with Spain promising greater autonomy to Cuba. In 1879–80, Cuban patriot Calixto García attempted to start another war known as the Little War but failed to receive enough support. Slavery in Cuba was abolished in 1875 but the process was completed only in 1886. An exiled dissident named José Martí founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York in 1892. The aim of the party was to achieve Cuban independence from Spain. In January 1895, Martí traveled to Monte Cristi and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to join the efforts of Máximo Gómez. Martí recorded his political views in the \n\n of Montecristi. Fighting against the Spanish army began in Cuba on 24 February 1895, but Martí was unable to reach Cuba until 11 April 1895. Martí was killed in the Battle of Dos Rios on 19 May 1895. His death immortalized him as Cuba's national hero.  Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on guerrilla and sabotage tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression. General Valeriano Weyler, the military governor of Cuba, herded the rural population into what he called reconcentrados, described by international observers as \"fortified towns\". These are often considered the prototype for 20th-century concentration camps. Between 200,000 and 400,000 Cuban civilians died from starvation \n\n publicly denounced Spanish rule and demanded independence. With only forty men in his force, they were quickly defeated by Spanish troops. Agüero was arrested en route to Puerto Príncipe while trying to flee to the United States. His armed revolt had failed miserably, but as historian Cento Gomez stated, \"it was a ground breaking event in the history of Cuban struggle for independence.\" On August 12, 1851, he was shot by a firing squad of Spanish troops alongside three of his compatriots in Puerto Príncipe (today’s Camagüey province). Years later Cuba did achieve independence from Spanish rule, and to honor Agüero's dedication to the Cuban cause of freedom, after the conclusion of the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898), several public places and buildings were named after him. Even fast food restaurants have their billboards have the name Joaquín de Agüero emblazoned on their billboards.\n\n By 1868, many countries in Latin America had obtained independence from Spain. In October 1868, Cuban planter and sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes and his followers proclaimed independence for Cuba. This proclamation led to the Ten Years' War with Spain and ended in the independence movement defeat in 1878. In August 1879, a second struggle ensued known as the Little War and lasted until September 1880 with the independence movement defeat once more. In February 1895, a new independence struggle movement began and is known as the \"Cuban War of Independence\" and was led by Cuban Poet José Martí who died in May 1895 at \n\n Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter Carlos Manuel de Céspedes. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. On 27 December 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service. The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War. A great number of the rebels were volunteers from the Dominican Republic, and other countries, as well as numerous Chinese indentured servants.

Forensic scientists use various specialized techniques, including comparison microscopy and computerized imaging systems, to analyze and compare bullet markings in order to establish reliable associations between a bullet and a specific firearm.\n\nOverall, primary and secondary markings on metal bullets play a crucial role in the identification of weapons, aiding in criminal investigations, and supporting the justice system.\n\n of raised burrs; it also prevented the necessity of the armor being softer than an engraving tool. Late in the seventeenth century, etching became used to produce the graduations on measuring instruments; the thinness of lines that etching could produce allowed for the production of more precise and accurate instruments than were possible before.

One 2006 study of children age 3–10 in India reported 93% of children bed-sharing while a 2006 study of children in Kentucky in the United States reported 15% of infants and toddlers 2 weeks to 2 years engage in bed-sharing. Bed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the crib. In many parts of the world, bed-sharing simply has the practical benefit of keeping the child warm at night. Bed-sharing has been relatively recently re-introduced into Western culture by practitioners \n\n Records show the earliest duvets were made in China, around 3000 B.C. From Viking times, duvets of eider down were used by people on the northern coast of Norway. From the 16th century, wealthy people all over Europe began buying and using such duvets. In the 17th century, Paul Rycaut was among the first to try and market the duvet in England. In the story The Princess and the Pea, published in 1835, H.C. Andersen wrote about a princess lying on 10 eiderdown duvets. In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, an Englishman on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise: \"There is one thing very particular to them, that they do not cover themselves with bed-clothes, but lay one feather-bed over, and another under. This is comfortable enough in winter, but how they can bear their feather-beds over them in summer, as is generally practised, I cannot conceive.\"\n\nAn adjustable bed is a bed that allows for the head and foot sections to be raised and lowered. Modern adjustable beds use electrical motors to control movement, and often include extras such as heat and massage. Adjustable beds have in some shape or form been available for many years. They have their roots in the hospital industry, which long ago discovered the many advantages of adjustable beds. It was not until the 1960's that these devices became popular for the general consumer, and since the price has dropped while the quality has risen. There are many medicinal advantages that are associated with adjustable beds.\nAdjustable beds have been shown to improve circulation, help to ease lower back pain and tension, improve breathing conditions, help with acid reflux, and have many other benefits. Many of these advantages come from the ability to easily put yourself in the semi-fowler position. The semi-fowler position is when the head is elevated to 30 - 45 degrees, and is largely accepted in the hospital industry as providing many advantages for patients who have undergone surgery. Of all the medical benefits associated with adjustable beds, perhaps the most intriguing is its help with combating acid reflux. Acid Reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a common medical condition wherein acids from the stomach are regurgitated into the esophagus.\nIt is incredibly common and by some estimates affects over 40 million Americans each year. Small amounts of acid reflux, or heartburn, are normal, but chronic cases will result in damage an inflammation of the esophagus. Over a long period of time acid reflux will result in hoarseness, chronic cough, throat and chest pain, and feeling like there is always a lump in your throat. Gravity plays an incredibly large part in controlling acid reflux, so it is no surprise that acid reflux is at its worst at night when the body is in a prone position. It is also at night that acid reflux can cause the most damage. This is because swallowing helps to bring the acid reflux back down to the stomach, but at night you do not swallow frequently, so the acid reflux stays in the esophagus for greater periods of time. This is where the advantage of owning an adjustable bed comes in. By sleeping with your upper body slightly elevated acid reflux can often be controlled, and when this is combined with some of the medicines available for acid reflux, it provides a powerful means of preventing and controlling acid reflux. Adjustable beds offer many other advantages that revolve around individual comfort and usability. They make it much easier to watch TV or to read books in bed.\nIt is also much more ergonomic and practical to eat in bed with an adjustable bed. Whether you are purchasing your adjustable bed for one of the many of the medical reasons, to get a better nights rest, or for any of the other advantages associated with them, you will be amazed at the luxurious feelings associated with these beds.\n\n The state bed, intended for receiving important visitors and producing heirs before a select public, but not intended for sleeping in, evolved during the second half of the seventeenth century, developing the medieval tradition of receiving visitors in the bedroom, which had become the last and most private room of the standard suite of rooms in a Baroque apartment. Louis XIV developed the rituals of receptions in his state bedchamber, the petit lever to which only a handful of his court élite might expect to be invited. The other monarchs of Europe soon imitated his practice; even his staunchest enemy, William III of England, had his \"grooms of the bedchamber\", a signal honour. The state bed, a lit à la duchesse&mdash;its canopy supported without visible posts&mdash; was delivered for the use of Queen Marie Leszczyńska at Versailles, as the centrepiece of a \n\nQuestion: when did beds become popular in france and germany\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is one of his earliest compositions and featured in the Beatles live act in their early days. The group recorded the song at their 1962 audition for Decca Records, but never issued it on any of their official releases. Instead, Cilla Black recorded it for her debut single, which was produced by George Martin. The single reached No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1963. The Beatles audition version was left off Anthology 1, even though the other Lennon–McCartney originals from the same session, \"Hello Little Girl\" and \"Like Dreamers Do\", were included.

In 1966 a new French version, also by lyricist Michel Rivgauche, was recorded by Dalida as \"Parlez-moi de lui\" (\"Tell me about him\"). This rendition slightly alters the original melody. This adaptation was covered by Françoise Hardy on her 1968 album Françoise Hardy (commonly known as Comment te dire adieu).\n\nQuestion: who wrote the song the glory of love\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ledyard Stebbins. The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by Julian Huxley in his book, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis. In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete. Developmental biologists did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that \n\n  Alfred Russel Wallace (8 January 1823 – 7 November 1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, biologist and illustrator. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species. Like Darwin, Wallace did extensive fieldwork—first in the Amazon River basin, and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the \n\n of the organisms named inside of it. In 1859, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published. In this book, he described his theory of evolution by natural selection. Both the work of Darwin and his contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace —who was also working on the theory of evolution—were informed by the careful study of insects. In addition, Darwin collected many species of invertebrate during his time aboard ; many of the specimens collected were insects. Using these collections, he was able to study sexual dimorphism, geographic distribution of species, and mimicry; all of these concepts influenced Darwin's theory of evolution. Unfortunately, a firm popular belief in the immutability of species was a major hurdle in the acceptance of the theory.\n\n the Origin of Species. ; (Online: 6th Edition (text)) ; The Origin of Species is one of the hallmark works of biology. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. It was first published on November 24, 1859 and the initial print run was oversubscribed by booksellers at Murray's Autumn sale the day before. ; Darwin presents a theory of natural selection that is in most aspects identical to the theories now accepted by \n\n Genetics and the Origin of Species is a 1937 book by the Ukrainian-American evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. It is regarded as one of the most important works of the modern synthesis, and was one of the earliest. The book popularized the work of population genetics to other biologists, and influenced their appreciation for the genetic basis of evolution. In his book, Dobzhansky applied the theoretical work of Sewall Wright (1889–1988) to the study of natural populations, allowing him to address evolutionary problems in a novel way during his time. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. The study of evolution was present, but greatly neglected at the time. Dobzhansky illustrates that evolution regarding the origin and nature of species during this time in history was deemed mysterious, but had expanding potential for progress to be made in its field.\n\nQuestion: who wrote the book the origin of species\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The tour commenced on March 26 and concluded on April 5, 1966. Support acts for the tour included Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders, Ian Witcomb, Antoine et les Problèmes (les Charlots), The Newbeats, Les Hou-Lops and Ronnie Bird.\n\n In 2007, the band grossed US$437 million on their A Bigger Bang Tour, which earned them an entry in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records for the most lucrative music tour. When asked if the band would retire after the tour, Jagger said \"I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours. We've got no plans to stop any of that really.\" Two years later in October 2009, Jagger joined U2 on stage to perform \"Gimme Shelter\" (with Fergie and will.i.am) and \"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\" with U2 at the 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Concert.\n\n The Rolling Stones' 1964 1st American Tour was the band's first concert tour of the United States. The tour commenced on June 5 and concluded on June 20, 1964. On this tour, the band supported their first U.S. album The Rolling Stones. The band played eleven shows in total, including two each on 6 and 7 June, and gave several performances on various television shows during the tour. The band also recorded its next single, \"It's All Over Now\", next British EP, Five by Five, and much of its next US album, 12 x 5, at Chess Studios on 10 and 11 June. Tony Scaduto's 1974 work, Mick Jagger: Everybody's Lucifer, gives an excellent overview (pp. 154-164) of this first U.S. tour by the Rolling Stones, including their time in New York City at the beginning of their tour and then their travels several days later into the heartland of America. \"Their fantasies about America smashed against reality,\" Scaduto tells his readers (p. 159), including an excellent account of the band's performance (pp. 160-161) in Omaha, Nebraska and the band's disappointment with their appearance on Dean Martin's \"Hollywood Palace\" show.\n\n the famous Gretsch drum set that he continued to play with the Stones until his death, as well as his first employment of a china cymbal as a crash.

However, this United States tour did not carry on into Europe in 1979, breaking the group's similar schedule of performing in Europe every three years, which had started in 1967. This gap-year from touring prompted Keith Richards to join Ronnie Wood on his 1979 United States solo tour, to promote his then-album Gimme Some Neck, in the process forming the band The New Barbarians.\n\n The Rolling Stones' US Tour 1978 was a concert tour of the United States that took place during June and July 1978, immediately following the release of the group's 1978 album Some Girls.

Since 2002, the state has offered a tax incentive for large film productions to drive producers to the state and bolster its economy. The first season was shot primarily in Atlanta, but required a great deal of coordination with the city to shut down streets and parks for filming. Production for subsequent seasons moved mainly to Riverwood Studios (doing business as Raleigh Studios Atlanta), a plot of land covering approximately 120 acres, located outside of Senoia, Georgia. Some existing buildings were used here, such as a subdivision that is used by several families, which serves as the Alexandria Safe-Zone. Other buildings are constructed as sets, such as the exterior shots of the main Hilltop mansion, the trash \n\n Slasher.com is a 2016 horror feature film directed by Chip Gubera and starring Jewel Shepard, R.A. Mihailoff, All-4-One's Delious Kennedy, Ben Kaplan, and Morgan Carter.\n\n The series is filmed in Nova Scotia, Canada. Thom Fitzgerald wrote and directed the original series, which also features Jeremy Akerman, Naomi-Joy Blackhall-Butler, Pasha Ebrahimi, Michael McPhee, Glen Matthews, Lisa-Rose Snow, Candy Palmater and Rob Joseph Leonard. Season 2 introduces new characters played by Johnny Terris, Kevin Kincaid and Riley Raymer.\n\n The series' head writer for all 65 episodes was Ian Weir, who wrote all but five episodes. Its director was Michael Berry. The first season of the show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, the second season was recorded at the studios of CJOH-TV in Ottawa, Ontario, and the third and fourth seasons were videotaped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida.\n\n Principal photography for the first season took place from October 22 to December 18, 2018, in Toronto, Ontario. Filming for the third season began on February 8, 2021, and finished on May 3, 2021. The writer/producer Paul Simms said that series does not use CGI effects: \"There's no fully digital characters or anything like that.

The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics. Psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks, feels, or even behaves. This correlation can be viewed in normal, everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause one's foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene. In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music. By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident.\n\n In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. The loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.\n\nHow is the degree of hearing loss measured?\nWhat is loss of loudness vs. loss of clarity?\nWhat are my hearing aid options?\nKnown as the pinna, the outer ear captures sounds from the environment and funnels them into the ear canal.\nSound waves travel down the ear canal and hit the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates and transfers the vibrations to the small bones in the middle ear (hammer, anvil and stirrup) which send the vibrations into the inner ear.\nThe vibrations are transferred into one of two parts of the inner ear, the Cochlea. The Cochlea is a snail shaped, fluid filled organ of sound. The vibrations move microscopic, finely tuned sensory cells which send impulses to the brain where sound is interpreted.\nThe other parts of the inner ear are the Semi Curricular Canals which is responsible for our balance system.\nHearing loss is typically divided into two categories: conductive and sensorineural.\nConductive - A conductive hearing loss is a problem in the outer and/or middle ear and affects the conduction of sound from the environment to the inner ear/organ of hearing. It can result from something as simple as wax occluding the ear canal to the build up of fluid behind the eardrum. A conductive hearing loss is usually medically or surgically treatable.\nSensorineural - A sensorineural hearing loss is a problem in the inner ear. It is permanent and can vary from mild to profound. The causes are numerous and can be the result of, for example, exposure to very loud sounds, the aging process, or genetics. Over 17 million Americans of all ages have this type of hearing loss.\nIn order to understand hearing loss, one must understand what “normal” hearing is. Normal hearing means a person can hear sounds at a variety of frequencies (pitches) around 0 – 20 decibels (dB HL). Normal conversational speech typically is at 45 dB HL. Loud speech is around 65dB HL, and sounds like a lawn mower is around 95 dB HL.\nWhen someone has a hearing loss, it means that they have to have sounds louder than 20 dB before they can first detect it. We use the terms mild, moderate, severe and profound to describe the varying degrees of hearing loss.\nMild - A person with a mild hearing loss can hear normal speech, however, it will seem “faint.” If the speaker is far away from them or there is background noise, they will have more difficulty understanding what is being said.\nModerate - People with a moderate hearing loss will state that everyone mumbles since they won’t be able to hear all of the speech sounds. With increased volume, they will do better; however, the level of concentration required to participate in a conversation, especially in noise, is exhausting, and often leads to people avoiding social situations.\nSevere – This is the level that most people think of when they think about hearing loss. None of the speech sounds are audible for a person with a severe hearing loss and they may require people to shout to be heard. A hearing aid will make many of the sounds audible, but the listener may need to watch the talker’s lip movements to supplement what they hear.\nProfound - Speech is mostly inaudible even with a hearing aid for an individual with a profound hearing loss. With a hearing aid, the listener may only hear the low pitch speech sounds, such as vowels and the rhythm of speech. Amplified speech will not be clear and this person may benefit from a cochlear implant.\nIf you answer ‘YES’ to more than one of the following questions, you may have a hearing loss and should consult your primary care physician about a referral to a licensed audiologist.\nDo voices seem soft or muffled?\nDo you have trouble hearing when it is noisy?\nDo you have trouble hearing and/or understanding what people say to you?\nDo you sometimes mishear or misunderstand what someone says to you?\nDo you turn up the volume of the television?\nDo you have trouble hearing on the telephone?\nDo you have trouble hearing the telephone or doorbell ring?\nFirst of all, you should ask your primary care physician for a referral to a licensed audiologist who can evaluate your hearing acuity. The audiologist will then make the appropriate recommendations for treatment options and communication strategies. In many cases there is technology available that can improve your hearing and quality of life.\nWe use hearing for communication and safety. Hearing aids can help you to hear what people are saying as well as improve your access to environmental sounds. Everyone’s hearing loss is different and there is no one-size-fits-all device. Consult a licensed audiologist to find out what hearing aid is most appropriate for your hearing loss.\nHearing aids come in all shapes and sizes and offer different types of technology. A hearing aid is a miniature sound processor that the audiologist will program to make sounds louder specific to your hearing loss. A hearing aid will not restore normal hearing.\nHearing aids today are much more user friendly and able to improve sound quality than ever before. There is no signal “best hearing aid,” so what might work for one person might not work for another. There are many options out there and the path to choosing the “right hearing aid for you” can be confusing. That’s where Clarke Hearing Center audiologists stand out from the rest.\nYour audiologist will discuss the options with you and will make a recommendation based on your particular needs and preference.\nThese hearing aids leave the ear canal open, allowing for a more natural sound quality by preserving some of the natural resonances of the outer ear. These types of hearing aids are particularly suited for people who have a mild to moderate “high frequency” hearing loss. They may be fit behind the ear or in the folds of the fleshy part of the ear called the pinna. Regardless, they all have a microphone, digital circuitry, amplifier, and battery.\nMost high end hearing aids are able to communicate with ear other via wireless technology. If a patient changes the volume in one hearing aid, the other automatically adjusts. If a hearing aid automatically adjusts to sounds coming from the environment, both will adapt to coordinate how they amplify the sounds together.\nAlso available is the availability for a hearing aid to use Bluetooth technology. Through a “gateway” device, similar in appearance to an iPod, the hearing aids can connect to Bluetooth compatible telephones, computers, TVs and more.\nComputer chips can now amplify sounds in several different ways, adapting to how loud a room is and whether speech and or noise are present. The hearing aids will amplify sounds differently when the users are sitting in a room watching television as compared to when in a restaurant when background noise is more of a problem.\nCircuits are “smarter” and can recognize speech , putting more emphasis on speech sounds than competing noise. It also can reduce environmental sounds such as wind noise, without compromising the quality of speech sounds.\nMany people have an outdated perception of what a hearing aid is. Too many people know someone who bought a hearing aid, only to let it sit in their drawer. With the care and attention you will receive from the Clarke Hearing Center staff, you will learn to appreciate the changes in technology and understand how a hearing aid can help you.\nAudiologists are the primary health-care professionals who evaluate, diagnose, treat, and manage hearing loss and balance disorders in adults and children. Audiologists prescribe and fit hearing aids, assist in cochlear implant programs, perform ear or hearing-related surgical monitoring, design and implement hearing conservation programs and newborn hearing screening programs, and provide hearing rehabilitation training.\nWe are happy to help answer any additional questions you may have.

It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion. According to Barthes, listening can be understood on three levels: alerting, deciphering, and understanding how the sound is produced and how it affects the listener. People listen for 45 percent of their time communicating. Alerting, the first level, involves detection of environmental sound cues. This means that certain places have certain sounds associated with them; for \n\n The Forest Grove Sound was an unexplained noise, described by The Oregonian as a \"mechanical scream\", heard in Forest Grove, Oregon in February 2016. In February 2016, a high pitched noise was heard at night in Forest Grove, Oregon. The Department of Forestry determined that their equipment was not the cause of the sound. The news about the noise was first shared with Dave Nemeyer by a Forest Grove resident, who posted a video of it on the city's Facebook page. The Washington Post described the noise as sounding like a \"giant flute played off pitch\", car brakes, or a steam whistle. NBC News described it as \"akin to a bad one-note violin solo broadcast over a microphone with nonstop feedback\".

Mandarin Chinese has an equally dominant presence in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Xinjiang. The languages of the majority of the inhabitants of the former Soviet Central Asian Republics belong to the Turkic language group. Turkmen is mainly spoken in Turkmenistan, and as a minority language in Afghanistan, Russia, Iran and Turkey. Kazakh and Kyrgyz are related languages of the Kypchak group of Turkic languages and are spoken throughout Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and as a minority language in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Xinjiang. Uzbek and Uyghur are spoken \n\n The Oghuz languages are a sub-branch of the Turkic language family, spoken by approximately 108 million people. The three languages with the largest number of speakers are Turkish, Azerbaijani and Turkmen, which combined account for more than 95% of speakers. Kara-Khanid scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari, who lived in 11th century, stated that the Oghuz language was the simplest among all Turkic languages. Swedish turcologist and linguist Lars Johanson notes that Oghuz languages form a clearly discernible and closely related block within the Turkic language family as the cultural and political history of the speakers of Oghuz languages has linked them more closely up to the modern age.\n\n The Finnish language is spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns elsewhere. Unlike the languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are North Germanic languages, or Russian, which is a Slavic language, Finnish is a Uralic language of the Finnic languages group. Typologically, Finnish is agglutinative. As other Uralic languages, Finnish has vowel harmony, and like other Finnic languages, it has consonant gradation.\n\n The Finnic (Fennic) or more precisely Balto-Finnic (Balto-Fennic; Baltic Finnic, Baltic Fennic) languages, are a branch of the Uralic language family spoken around the Baltic Sea by the Baltic Finnic peoples. There are around 7 million speakers who live mainly in Finland and Estonia. Traditionally, eight Finnic languages have been recognized. The major modern representatives of the family are Finnish and Estonian, the official languages of their respective nation states. The other Finnic languages in the Baltic Sea region are Ingrian and Votic, spoken in Ingria by the Gulf of Finland; and Livonian, once spoken around the Gulf of Riga. Spoken farther northeast are Karelian, Ludic and Veps, in the region of Lakes Onega and Ladoga. In addition, since the 1990s, several Finnic-speaking minority groups have emerged to seek recognition \n\n (such as in English, for example). Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the Baltic group (Latvian and Lithuanian), the Celtic group (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish and Breton ), Greek, Armenian and Albanian. A distinct non-Indo-European family of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Erzya, Komi, Mari, Moksha and Udmurt) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, Hungary and parts of Russia. Turkic languages include Azerbaijani, Kazakh and Turkish, in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe (Balkan Gagauz Turkish, Bashkir, Chuvash, Crimean Tatar, Karachay-Balkar, Kumyk, Nogai and Tatar).

Throughout the twentieth-century applicator tampons like Tampax (Always) and pads such as Kotex were increasingly popular in the Global North. There are environmental costs of using menstruation products containing plastic and chemicals. As an alternative, companies are manufacturing reusable period panties, cloth menstrual pads, menstrual cups, biodegradable sanitary napkins and other eco-friendly products. Not all cultures use menstrual products, opting instead for natural materials or homemade options.\n\nIf a woman does not have menstrual pads available while menstruating, there are several alternatives she can consider. One option is to use toilet paper as a temporary substitution. Although it may not provide the same level of absorbency and protection as menstrual pads, it can help manage the flow until more suitable products become available.\n\nAnother alternative is to use reusable sanitary pads. These are cloth pads that can be washed and reused multiple times. They come in various sizes and absorbencies, providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective option for managing menstrual flow.\n\nIn addition, some women may choose to use period underwear or menstrual cups as alternatives to traditional menstrual pads. Period underwear is specially designed with built-in absorbent layers to prevent leaks, while menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood.\n\nIt's important to note that these alternatives may vary in terms of comfort, effectiveness, and personal preference. It's recommended for each individual to explore different options and find what works best for them.\n\nReference:\n- Menstrual pads: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_pad\n\nCloth menstrual pads are reusable pads made from layers of absorbent fabrics, such as cotton or hemp, that are worn in the underwear to collect menstrual fluid. They serve as an alternative to disposable sanitary napkins or menstrual cups. \n\nCompared to disposable sanitary napkins, cloth menstrual pads have a few advantages. Firstly, they are generally less expensive over time because they can be reused multiple times. This can be particularly cost-effective for individuals who experience longer or heavier periods. Additionally, cloth pads reduce the amount of waste produced since they do not need to be thrown away after each use.\n\nIn comparison to menstrual cups, cloth pads offer a different level of convenience and comfort. Menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina and collect blood internally, while cloth pads sit on the outside of the underwear and absorb blood externally. Some individuals may find cloth pads more comfortable or easier to use than inserting a cup.\n\nIt is important to note that both cloth menstrual pads and disposable sanitary napkins require regular changing throughout the day to maintain hygiene and prevent leaks. Similarly, proper cleaning and care should be taken with both types of products.\n\nOverall, choosing between cloth menstrual pads, disposable sanitary napkins, or menstrual cups is a personal preference based on factors such as cost, environmental impact, comfort, and ease of use. It may be helpful to try different options and see which one works best for you.\n\n the World Menstrual Network to connect activists, practitioners, politicians, researchers and individuals around the world working to improve menstrual health. With The Malawi Girl Guides Association, The Cup Effect Hampton ran a feasibility study in a refugee camp, secondary schools and a national park which showed that women and girls in Malawi want to use menstrual cups. Compared to washable cloths or disposable pads or tampons, they found cups more comfortable, cheaper and more environmentally sustainable. As a result, ActionAid Malawi has begun a national menstrual cup programme. Hampton promotes menstrual health through the media, including an essay for Aeon ideas website and for World Menstrual Day.\n\nDuring their periods, women use various products to manage menstrual bleeding. Some common products include menstrual pads, tampons, and menstrual cups. \n\nMenstrual pads are placed on panties to collect the menstrual fluid outside of the body. They come in different sizes and absorbencies to accommodate different flows. Pads should be changed every four to eight hours, depending on the flow.\n\nTampons are narrow columns of absorbent fabric that are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual fluid. They also come in different sizes and absorbencies. It's important to change tampons every four to eight hours to reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a rare but serious condition.\n\nMenstrual cups are soft cups usually made of medical-grade silicone and are shaped like a bell.

When the German U-boat U-20 sank the British liner on 7 May 1915 with 128 US citizens aboard, Wilson demanded an end to German attacks on passenger ships, and warned that the USA would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare in violation of \"American rights\" and of \"international and obligations.\" Wilson's Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan, resigned, believing that the President's protests against the German use of U-boat attacks conflicted with America's official commitment to neutrality. On the other hand, Wilson came under pressure from \n\n in this attack, it prompted US President Woodrow Wilson to declare that if Germany continued the practice, the United States would break diplomatic relations with Germany. Fearing the American entry into the war, Germany tried to appease the United States by issuing on May 4, 1916 the Sussex pledge, which promised a change in Germany's naval warfare policy. These were the primary elements of the pledge: In 1917, Germany became convinced that it could defeat the Allied Forces by instituting unrestricted submarine warfare before the United States could enter the war. The Sussex pledge was, therefore, rescinded in January 1917, which started the decisive stage of the so-called First Battle of the Atlantic. The resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram caused the United States to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.\n\n When World War I broke out in Europe during the summer of 1914, the United States stuck to a strict policy of neutrality. On August 4, 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared to Congress that, \"The United States must be neutral in fact, as well as in name, during these days that are to try men's souls. We must be impartial in thought, as well as action.\" However, after years of unrestricted German submarine warfare, the sinking of the Lusitania, the Black Tom explosion, and the public release of the Zimmermann Telegram, the United States could no longer remain neutral in the \n\n  The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, nearly three years after World War I started. A ceasefire and Armistice was declared on November 11, 1918. Before entering the war, the U.S. had remained neutral, though it had been an important supplier to the United Kingdom, France, and the other powers of the Allies of World War I. The U.S. made its major contributions in terms of supplies, raw material, and money, starting in 1917. American soldiers under General of the Armies John Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), arrived at the rate of 10,000 men a day on the Western Front in the summer of 1918. \n\n The American entry into World War I came on April 6, 1917, after a year long effort by President Woodrow Wilson to get the United States into the war. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans, as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe. Over time, especially after reports of atrocities \n\nQuestion: when did united states enter world war i\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, inflation remains low because of either a pegged exchange rate or a supply shock, and thus the central bank does not tighten credit and money. Increasingly speculative loans are made as diminishing returns lead to reduced yields. Eventually inflation begins or the economy slows, and when asset prices decline, a bubble is pricked which encourages a macroeconomic bust. In 2006, William White argued that \"financial liberalization has increased the likelihood of boom-bust cycles of the Austrian sort\" and he has later argued the \"near complete dominance of Keynesian economics in the \n\n Classical economist David Ricardo embraced Say's Law, suggesting, in Keynes's formulation, that \"supply creates its own demand\". According to Say's Law, for every excess supply (glut) of goods in one market, there is a corresponding excess demand (shortage) in another. This theory suggests that a general glut can never be accompanied by inadequate demand for products on a macroeconomic level. In challenge of Say's Law, Thomas Malthus, Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi and other 19th century economists argued that \"effective demand\" is the foundation of a stable economy. Responding to the Great Depression of the 20th century, in the 1930s Michał Kalecki and John Maynard Keynes concurred with the latter theory, suggesting that \n\n The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The theory views business cycles as the consequence of excessive growth in bank credit due to artificially low interest rates set by a central bank or fractional reserve banks. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. Proponents believe that a sustained period of low interest rates and excessive credit creation from fractional reserve banks result in a volatile and unstable imbalance between saving and investment. According to \n\n creates its own supply\" and developing a comprehensive theory of effective demand. According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. This triggers a multiplier effect which draws the economy toward underemployment equilibrium. By the same token, strong demand results in unplanned reduction of inventories, which tends to increase production, employment, and incomes. If entrepreneurs consider such trends sustainable, investments typically increase, thereby improving potential levels of production. In the 1960s, Robert Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud did further work on effective demand, and in the 1970s Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman published a well-known model of spillover effects upon effective demand.\n\n The Austrian theory of the business cycle (ABCT) focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who posited that fractional reserve banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes which leads to an artificial \"boom\". Mises stated that this artificial \"boom\" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called \"malinvestment\" - which eventually must end in a \"bust\". Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment \n\nQuestion: who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Libavius in Alchymia (1594) refers to \"vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum\". Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. The term ethanol was invented in 1892, blending \"ethane\" with the \"-ol\" ending of \"alcohol\", which was generalized as a libfix.\n\n The earliest known instance of the term \"moonshine\" being used to refer to illicit alcohol dates to the 1785 copy of Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. Prior to that, \"moonshine\" referred to anything \"illusory\" or to literally the light of the moon. The U.S. Government considers the word a \"fanciful term\" and does not regulate its use on the labels of commercial products, as such, legal moonshines may be any type of spirit, which must be indicated elsewhere on the label.\n\n Spirits are distilled beverages that contain no added sugar and have at least 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). Popular spirits include borovička, brandy, gin, rum, slivovitz, tequila, vodka, and whisky. Brandy is a spirit created by distilling wine, whilst vodka may be distilled from any starch- or sugar-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from grains such as sorghum, corn, rye or wheat.\n\n Liquors (or spirits) are alcoholic drinks produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced by means of fermenting grain, fruit, or vegetables. Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. For the most common distilled drinks, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, shōchū, soju, tequila, whiskey, brandy and rum are examples of distilled drinks. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack. Fortified wine is wine, such as port or sherry, to which a distilled beverage (usually brandy) has been added. Fortified wine is distinguished from spirits made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of distillation, while fortified wine is simply wine that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth.\n\n The word \"alcohol\" is from the Arabic kohl (الكحل), a powder used as an eyeliner. Al- is the Arabic definite article, equivalent to the in English. Alcohol was originally used for the very fine powder produced by the sublimation of the natural mineral stibnite to form antimony trisulfide. It was considered to be the essence or \"spirit\" of this mineral. It was used as an antiseptic, eyeliner, and cosmetic. The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when \"spirits\" was a synonym for hard liquor. Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the word as a term used by \"barbarous\" authors for \"fine powder.\" Vigo wrote: \"the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for \n\nQuestion: where did the term spirits for alcohol come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Brown and twenty-one followers, including whites (three of whom were Brown's sons) and Blacks (three free Blacks, one freedman, and one fugitive slave), planned to seize the armory and use weapons stored there to arm Black slaves in order to spark a general uprising by the slave population. Although the raiders were initially successful in cutting the telegraph line and capturing the Armory, they allowed a passing train to continue, and at the next station with a working telegraph the conductor alerted authorities to the attack. The raiders were forced by the militia and other locals to barricade themselves in the Armory, in a sturdy building later known as John Brown's Fort. Robert E. Lee (then a \n\n In 1859 elements of the First Light Division, the City Guards, participated in the suppression of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, an abortive attempt to ignite a slave rebellion. Steuart personally led six companies of Militia: the City Guard, Law Greys and Shields Guard from Baltimore, and the United Guards, Junior Defenders and Independent Riflemen from the city of Frederick.\n\n John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry (formerly spelled Harper's Ferry) was an effort by abolitionist John Brown, from October 16 to 18, 1859, to initiate a slave revolt in Southern states by taking over the United States arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia). It has been called the dress rehearsal for, or Tragic Prelude to, the Civil War. Brown's party of 22 was defeated by a company of U.S. Marines, led by First Lieutenant Israel Greene. Ten of the raiders were killed during the raid, seven were tried and executed afterwards, and five escaped. Several of those present at the raid would \n\n John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry. Owen led a party of five escapees from the failed raid to safety in the north. On or about the night of October 23, 1859 these men ascended the slope of South Mountain after circling around Turner's Gap to avoid the men and dogs lying in wait for them in the mountain pass. To their astonishment, there on the crest of the mountain was an odd stone tower. Owen Brown retold the experience during his only known interview in 1873, both he and the interviewer then still apparently unaware the men had stumbled upon Washington's Monument. Although it was a popular meeting place for the citizenry of Boonsboro, weather and vandalism reduced the monument to rubble. In that condition, it was used by the Union Army as a signal station during the Civil War.\n\n On October 16, 1859, the radical abolitionist John Brown led a group of 22 men in a raid on the Federal Arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. U.S. troops, led by Robert E. Lee, responded and quelled the raid. Subsequently, Brown was tried and executed by hanging in Charles Town on December 2, 1859. In 1860 the Democratic Party split into northern and southern factions over the issue of slavery in the territories and Stephen Douglas' support for popular sovereignty: after failing in both Charleston and Baltimore to nominate a single candidate acceptable to the South, Southern Democrats held their convention in Richmond, Virginia, on June 26, 1860, and nominated John C. Breckinridge as their party candidate for U.S. president. When Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected as president, Virginians were concerned about the implications for their state. While a majority of the state would look for compromises to the sectional differences, most people also opposed any restrictions on slaveholders' rights. As the state watched to see what South Carolina would do, many Unionists felt that the greatest danger to the state came not from the North but from \"rash secession\" by the lower South.\n\nQuestion: who led the soldiers in ending the raid on the harper 's ferry arsenal\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The lagoon remained as a scenic viewpoint (and was renamed \"Ariel's Grotto\", complete with a King Triton spouting statue) until 2004, when the water was drained and the sets and infrastructure were demolished. Pooh's Playful Spot was built where the attraction formerly stood and operated between 2005 and 2010 before making way for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train as part of the Fantasyland Expansion. However, the exterior to The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure contains a silhouette of the Nautilus in a rock wall and the tiki bar Trader Sam's Grog Grotto at Disney's Polynesian Village Resort serves a cocktail called the \"Nautilus\" which is itself served in a stylized drinking vessel resembling the submarine.\n\n Eden Rock contains 32 rooms and suites and 2 villas. The original rooms are described as being \"stuffed with antiques, family heirlooms, silver fixtures, steamer trunks, four-poster beds and watercolours of local scenes\". The beach houses contain one to three bedrooms. The Howard Hughes Suite is above the main building on the rock, and features hardwood floors, three verandahs offering 360-degree panoramas, and two bathrooms uniquely clad in welded copper. The Rockstar Suite opened in 2010, described as being a \"1486 sqm stunner with four master suites, a screening room, a fully-equipped recording studio, a pool table, a private pool, and a dedicated butler,\" costing $130,000 for a week's stay. The Villa Nina features two bedrooms, and its own pool and art gallery. The resort is served by two restaurants, \"The On The Rocks\" and \"The Sand Bar\", headed by chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.\n\n Announced in June 2018, an eighth \"port of call\" named Fantasy Springs will be added to the park as part of its largest expansion so far. It will comprise three areas themed to the films of Frozen, Tangled, and Peter Pan. There will be a total of four new attractions, three restaurants, and a new luxury hotel situated in the park itself. The entire area will be connected to the existing park through a pathway between the ports of Lost River Delta and Arabian Coast. Originally scheduled to be completed by the fiscal year of 2022, its opening date has been pushed back to the fiscal year of 2023 after further studies and reviews.\n\n The lagoon that houses the ride requires 9000000 USgal of water to fill. It is difficult to maintain, since divers had to be sent underwater every night to clean up debris and fix the audio-animatronics whenever they broke down. During the summers of 1959–1967, female cast members dressed in mermaid costumes could be seen sun-bathing themselves and performing synchronized swimming and underwater stunts for four hours each day. Disney ended this feature in 1967 after several mermaid performers reported health concerns, related to the submarines' diesel exhaust fumes and the highly chlorinated water. In addition, tourists taking pictures of them would block the thoroughfare between the Matterhorn and the submarine lagoon. The mermaids received $1.65 an hour, which in 2018 dollars would be $13.15 an hour. In 2005, an auction took place at the Disneyland Resort, where several pieces of the original attraction's scenery were sold, such as the shark fighting with the octopus on a rock. They were removed from the lagoon prior to the auction so new scenery for the updated Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage could be built into the lagoon.\n\nMagic Kingdom received a major refurbishment of \"it's a small world\", A major refurbishment of Pirates of the Caribbean, a new golden overlay for Cinderella Castle including a temporary stage show held at the castle called \"Cinderellabration\" featuring many Disney princesses and a new playground Pooh's Playful Spot. ; Epcot received Soarin' from Disney's California Adventure and A Hong Kong Disneyland Preview Center ; Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) received a major refurbishment of the Streets of America area, and the now extinct Lights, Motors, Action!

A lower LD50 is indicative of increased toxicity. There are four methods in which the LD50 test is measured: Subcutaneous : Venom is injected into the fatty layer beneath the skin. Intravenous : Venom is injected directly into a vein. Intramuscular : Venom is injected into a muscle. Intraperitoneal : Venom is injected into the abdominal cavity. The most commonly tested methods are subcutaneous and intravenous injections of mice. Subcutaneous is the most applicable to actual bites. \n\nWhat Is a Subcutaneous Injection?\nA subcutaneous injection is a method of administering medication. Subcutaneous means under the skin.\nIn this type of injection, a short needle is used to inject a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. Medication given this way is usually absorbed more slowly than if injected into a vein, sometimes over a period of 24 hours.\nThis type of injection is used when other methods of administration might be less effective. For example, some medications can’t be given by mouth because acid and enzymes in the stomach would destroy them.\nOther methods, like intravenous injection, can be difficult and costly. For small amounts of delicate drugs, a subcutaneous injection can be a useful, safe, and convenient method of getting a medication into your body.\nMedications administered by subcutaneous injection include drugs that can be given in small volumes (usually less than 1 mL but up to 2 mL is safe). Insulin and some hormones are commonly administered as subcutaneous injections.\nOther drugs that need to be given very quickly can also be administered via subcutaneous injection. Epinephrine comes in an automated injector form, called an EpiPen, that’s used to quickly treat severe allergic reactions. While it’s intended to be given intramuscularly, epinephrine will also work if given subcutaneously.\nSome pain medications like morphine and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) can be given this way as well. Drugs that prevent nausea and vomiting like metoclopramide (Reglan) or dexamethasone (DexPak) can also be given via subcutaneous injection.\nSome vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. Many other vaccines are administered as an intramuscular injection — into muscle tissue rather than under the skin.\nThe location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels.\nMedication: Vials of liquid medication can be single-use or multiuse. Vials can also be filled with a powder to which liquid needs to be added.\nSyringes: The needles are short, at 5/8 inches long. The thickness of the needle is usually 25 or 27 gauge. There may be other options for doses more than 1 mL or for children or people with visual impairments.\nAuto-injector pen: Some medications are available in a “pen” with a short single-use needle screwed onto the end of a pen-shaped, multiuse vial. The amount of medication needed is then dialed in at the end. As mentioned earlier, emergency medications like epinephrine can also come in this form.\n1. Wash your hands. Wash your hands with soap and warm water to prevent potential infection. Be sure to thoroughly scrub between fingers, on the backs of hands, and under fingernails. The recommends lathering for 20 seconds — the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice.\n3. Clean and inspect the injection site. Before injecting medication, inspect your skin to make sure there’s no bruising, burns, swelling, hardness, or irritation in the area. Alternate injection sites to prevent damage to an area with repeated injections. Then you should clean the skin with an alcohol swab. Let the alcohol dry thoroughly before doing the injection.\n4. Prepare the syringe with medication. Before withdrawing medication from a vial and injecting yourself or someone else, make sure you’re using the correct medication, at the correct dose, at the correct time, and in the right manner. Use a new needle and syringe with every injection.\nRemove the cap from the vial. If the vial is multidose, make a note about when the vial was first opened. The rubber stopper should be cleaned with an alcohol swab.\nDraw air into the syringe. Draw back the plunger to fill the syringe with air up to the dose that you’ll be injecting. This is done because the vial is a vacuum, and you need to add an equal amount of air to regulate the pressure. This makes it easier to draw the medication into the syringe. Don’t worry, though — if you forget this step, you can still get the medication out of the vial.\nInsert air into the vial. Remove the cap from the needle and push the needle through the rubber stopper at the top of the vial. Inject all the air into the vial. Be careful to not touch the needle to keep it clean.\nWithdraw the medication. Turn the vial and syringe upside down so the needle points upward. Then pull back on the plunger to withdraw the correct amount of medication.\nRemove any air bubbles. Tap the syringe to push any bubbles to the top and gently depress the plunger to push the air bubbles out.\nIf you’re using a pen delivery system, attach the needle to the pen.\nThe first time you use the pen, you’ll need to prime it to push out extra air in the delivery system.\nDial a small dose (usually 2 units or 0.02 mL, or as indicated by the package instructions) and push the button to expel the primer.\nDial the correct dose and prepare for your injection.\nPinch your skin. Take a big pinch of skin between your thumb and index finger and hold it. (Your thumb and forefinger should be about an inch and a half apart.) This pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection easier.\nInject the needle. Inject the needle into the pinched skin at a 90-degree angle. You should do this quickly, but without great force. If you have very little fat on your body, you may need to inject the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin.\nInsert the medication. Slowly push the plunger to inject the medication. You should inject the entire amount of medication.\nWithdraw the needle. Let go of the pinched skin and withdraw the needle. Discard the used needle in a puncture-resistant sharp’s container.\nApply pressure to the site. Use gauze to apply light pressure to the injection site. If there’s any bleeding, it should be very minor. You may notice a little bruising later. This is common and nothing to be concerned about.\nIf you’ll be doing this type of injection for more than one dose or for multiple days, you’ll need to rotate the injection sites. This means that you shouldn’t inject medicine into the same spot twice in a row.\nFor example, if you injected medicine into your left thigh this morning, use your right thigh this afternoon. Using the same injection site over and over again can cause discomfort and even tissue damage.\nThese symptoms should be reported to your physician immediately.\nDilaudid vs. Morphine: How Are They Different?\nHydromorphone and morphine are both strong pain medications. They are very similar, but have important differences. Learn the specifics here.\nIntravenous (IV) medications are given into your vein. Learn about the types of IV administration, their uses, and the risks.\nEnoxaparin (Lovenox) is an injectable drug used to prevent and treat blood clots.

Find out how to know if you have one and what to do about it.\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcut is the preferred abbreviation to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and potential errors.\n\nSubcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections.\n\nMedical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. They are commonly used to administer medications, especially those which cannot be administered by mouth as they would not be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth.\n\nMedications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. These medications cannot be administered orally as the molecules are too large to be absorbed in the intestines. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection.\n\nInsulin\nPerhaps the most common medication administered subcutaneously is insulin. While attempts have been made since the 1920s to administer insulin orally, the large size of the molecule has made it difficult to create a formulation with absorption and predictability that comes close to subcutaneous injections of insulin. People with type 1 diabetes almost all require insulin as part of their treatment regimens, and a smaller proportion of people with type 2 diabetes do as well - with tens of millions of prescriptions per year in the United States alone.\n\nInsulin historically was injected from a vial using a syringe and needle, but may also be administered subcutaneously using devices such as injector pens or insulin pumps. An insulin pump consists of a catheter which is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue, and then secured in place to allow insulin to be administered multiple times through the same injection site.\n\nRecreational drug use\nSubcutaneous injection may also be used by people to (self-) administer recreational drugs. This can be referred to as skin popping. In some cases, the administration of illicit drugs in this way is associated with unsafe practices leading to infections and other adverse effects. In rare cases, this results in serious side effects such as AA amyloidosis. Recreational drugs reported to be administered subcutaneously have included cocaine, mephedrone, and amphetamine derivatives such as PMMA.\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. Doses which would require more than 2 mL to be injected at once are not administered subcutaneously. Medications which may cause necrosis or otherwise be damaging or irritating to tissues should also not be administered subcutaneously. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area.\n\nRisks and complications\nWith normal doses of medicine (less than 2 mL in volume), complications or adverse effects are very rare. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". This term encompasses any combination of redness, swelling, itching, bruising, or other irritation that does not spread beyond the immediate vicinity of the injection. Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. There may also be specific complications associated with the specific medication being administered.\n\nMedication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. Heparin-based anticoagulants injected subcutaneously may cause hematoma and bruising around the injection site due to their anticoagulant effect. This includes heparin and low molecular weight heparin products such as enoxaparin. There is some low certainty evidence that administering the injection more slowly may decrease the pain from heparin injections, but not the risk of or extent of bruising. Subcutaneous heparin-based anticoagulation may also lead to necrosis of the surrounding skin or lesions, most commonly when injected in the abdomen.\n\nMany medications have the potential to cause local lesions or swelling due to the irritating effect the medications have on the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This includes medications such as apomorphine and hyaluronic acid injected as a filler, which may cause the area to appear bruised. Hyaluronic acid \"bruising\" may be treated using injections of hyaluronidase enzyme around the location.\n\nOther common medication-specific side effects include pain, burning or stinging, warmth, rash, flushing, or multiple of these reactions at the injection site, collectively termed \"injection site reactions\". This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued.\n\nThe administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. This includes the BCG vaccine which is associated with a specific scar appearance which can be used as evidence of prior vaccination. Other subcutaneous vaccines, many of which are live vaccines including the MMR vaccine and the varicella vaccine, which may cause fever and rash, as well as a feeling of general malaise for a day or two following the vaccination.\n\nTechnique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. A 90-degree angle is always used for medications such as heparin. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. The injection is administered slowly, lasting about 10 seconds per milliliter of fluid injected, and the needle may be left in place for 10 seconds following injection to ensure the medicine is fully injected.\n\nEquipment\nThe gauge of the needle used can range from 25 gauge to 27 gauge, while the length can vary between -inch to -inch for injections using a syringe and needle. For subcutaneous injections delivered using devices such as injector pens, the needle used may be as thin as 34 gauge (commonly 30-32 gauge), and as short as 3.5mm (commonly 3.5mm to 5mm). Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. The specific needle size/length, as well as appropriateness of a device such as a pen or pump, is based on the characteristics of a person's skin layers.\n\nLocations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm.\n The abdomen, avoiding a 2-inch circle around the navel.\n The front of the thigh, between 4 inches from the top of the thigh and 4 inches above the knee.\n The upper back.\n The upper area of the buttock, just behind the hip bone.\n\nThe choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections.\n\nSelf-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise. Self-administration by subcutaneous injection generally does not require disinfection of the skin outside of a hospital setting as the risk of infection is extremely low, but instead it is recommended to ensure that the site and person's hands are simply clean prior to administration.\n\nSee also\n Intramuscular injection\n Intravenous injection\n Intradermal injection\n\nReferences\n\nDosage forms\nRoutes of administration\nInjection (medicine)\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcut is the preferred abbreviation to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and potential errors.\n\nSubcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections.\n\nMedical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. They are commonly used to administer medications, especially those which cannot be administered by mouth as they would not be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth.\n\nMedications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. These medications cannot be administered orally as the molecules are too large to be absorbed in the intestines. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection.\n\nInsulin\nPerhaps the most common medication administered subcutaneously is insulin. While attempts have been made since the 1920s to administer insulin orally, the large size of the molecule has made it difficult to create a formulation with absorption and predictability that comes close to subcutaneous injections of insulin. People with type 1 diabetes almost all require insulin as part of their treatment regimens, and a smaller proportion of people with type 2 diabetes do as well - with tens of millions of prescriptions per year in the United States alone.\n\nInsulin historically was injected from a vial using a syringe and needle, but may also be administered subcutaneously using devices such as injector pens or insulin pumps. An insulin pump consists of a catheter which is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue, and then secured in place to allow insulin to be administered multiple times through the same injection site.\n\nRecreational drug use\nSubcutaneous injection may also be used by people to (self-) administer recreational drugs. This can be referred to as skin popping. In some cases, the administration of illicit drugs in this way is associated with unsafe practices leading to infections and other adverse effects. In rare cases, this results in serious side effects such as AA amyloidosis. Recreational drugs reported to be administered subcutaneously have included cocaine, mephedrone, and amphetamine derivatives such as PMMA.\n\nContraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. Doses which would require more than 2 mL to be injected at once are not administered subcutaneously. Medications which may cause necrosis or otherwise be damaging or irritating to tissues should also not be administered subcutaneously. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area.\n\nRisks and complications\nWith normal doses of medicine (less than 2 mL in volume), complications or adverse effects are very rare. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". This term encompasses any combination of redness, swelling, itching, bruising, or other irritation that does not spread beyond the immediate vicinity of the injection. Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. There may also be specific complications associated with the specific medication being administered.\n\nMedication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. Heparin-based anticoagulants injected subcutaneously may cause hematoma and bruising around the injection site due to their anticoagulant effect. This includes heparin and low molecular weight heparin products such as enoxaparin. There is some low certainty evidence that administering the injection more slowly may decrease the pain from heparin injections, but not the risk of or extent of bruising.

There are also enzymes (enterocyte digestive enzyme) on the surface for digestion. Villus capillaries collect amino acids and simple sugars taken up by the villi into the blood stream. Villus lacteals (lymph capillary) collect absorbed chylomicrons, which are lipoproteins composed of triglycerides, cholesterol and amphipathic proteins, and are taken to the rest of the body through the lymph fluid. Villi are specialized for absorption in the small intestine as they have a thin wall, one cell thick, which enables a shorter diffusion path. They have a large surface area so there will be more efficient absorption of fatty acids and glycerol into the blood stream. They have a rich blood supply to keep a concentration gradient.\n\nCongenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. Digestion involves both mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. Enzymatic hydrolysis is initiated by intraluminal processes requiring gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Malabsorption constitutes the pathological interference with the normal physiological sequence of digestion (intraluminal process), absorption (mucosal process) and transport (postmucosal events) of nutrients. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\nThe human body breaks down and absorbs food through a series of processes. When food is ingested, it enters the digestive system where it is broken down into simpler particles through the process of digestion. This involves both mechanical and chemical processes.\n\nThe initial breakdown of food starts in the mouth, where chewing and the action of enzymes in saliva begin the process of digestion. The partially digested food, known as the bolus, then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach. In the stomach, the bolus is further broken down by gastric juice into a semi-liquid substance called chyme.\n\nFrom the stomach, the chyme moves into the small intestine. The small intestine is the primary site of absorption in the digestive system. It is responsible for breaking down food into its simplest forms, such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nThe lining of the small intestine contains tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. These villi are covered with even smaller projections called microvilli, which further enhance the absorption process. The nutrients are then transported through the bloodstream to various cells and tissues in the body for energy production and other functions.\n\nNot all parts of the food are absorbed, and the undigested food material moves into the large intestine. The large intestine, particularly the colon, is involved in the reabsorption of water and electrolytes from the remaining undigested food. This process helps in the formation of solid waste material, which will be eliminated from the body.\n\nIt is important to note that the absorption of digested food material occurs primarily in the small intestine, whereas the large intestine is involved in water reabsorption. The structures and organs involved in the digestive process, such as the stomach, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, each have specific roles in breaking down and absorbing food.\n\nOverall, the human body's ability to break down and absorb food is a complex process involving various organs, enzymes, and physiological mechanisms to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients for optimal function.\n\n Malabsorption is a state arising from abnormality in absorption of food nutrients across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. This may lead to malnutrition and a variety of anaemias. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. A typical Western diet ingested by an adult in one day includes approximately 100 g of fat, 400 g of carbohydrate, 100 g of protein, 2 L of fluid, and the required sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, vitamins, and other elements. Salivary, gastric, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic secretions add an additional 7–8 L of protein-, lipid-, and electrolyte-containing fluid to intestinal contents. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less \n\nThe digestion and absorption process in the gastrointestinal tract involves several steps. \n\nFirstly, the ingestion of food and fluids occurs through the mouth, where mechanical breakdown of food starts with the help of teeth and mixing it with saliva to form a food bolus. Saliva also contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which begins the chemical digestion of cooked starch.\n\nAfter swallowing, the food bolus moves through the esophagus to reach the stomach. This movement is facilitated by peristalsis, which involves muscle contractions to propel the food throughout the GI tract. In the stomach, the food bolus is mixed with various gastric secretions, such as hydrochloric acid and enzymes, to form chyme. This mechanical breakdown of food continues in the stomach.\n\nNext, the chyme moves into the small intestine. Here, further digestion takes place with the help of pancreatic enzymes, bile from the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine itself. These enzymes break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed.\n\nThe small intestine is where most absorption occurs. The inner lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to various organs and tissues for energy and other functions.\n\nThe remaining undigested and unabsorbed materials, along with water, move into the large intestine. Here, water and electrolytes are absorbed, and the waste materials are formed into feces. The feces then move towards the rectum and are eliminated from the body through the anus during defecation.\n\nIn summary, digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract involve the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, followed by the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine and elimination of waste in the large intestine.\n\nQuestion: where are most nutrients absorbed in the human digestive tract\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This requires a hyaline cartilage precursor. There are two centers of ossification for endochondral ossification. The primary center In long bones, bone tissue first appears in the diaphysis (middle of shaft). Chondrocytes multiply and form trebeculae. Cartilage is progressively eroded and replaced by hardened bone, extending towards the epiphysis. A perichondrium layer surrounding the cartilage forms the periosteum, which generates sperm cells that then go on to make a collar that encircles the outside of the bone and remodels the medullary cavity on the inside. The nutrient artery enters via the nutrient foramen from a small opening in the diaphysis. It invades the primary center of ossification, bringing osteogenic cells (osteoblasts on the outside, osteoclasts on the \n\nEndochondral ossification is one of the two essential processes during fetal development of the mammalian skeletal system by which bone tissue is created. Unlike intramembranous ossification, which is the other process by which bone tissue is created, cartilage is present during endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is also an essential process during the rudimentary formation of long bones, the growth of the length of long bones, and the natural healing of bone fractures.\n\nGrowth of the cartilage model\nThe cartilage model will grow in length by continuous cell division of chondrocytes, which is accompanied by further secretion of extracellular matrix. This is called interstitial growth.\nThe process of appositional growth occurs when the cartilage model also grows in thickness due to the addition of more extracellular matrix on the peripheral cartilage surface, which is accompanied by new chondroblasts that develop from the perichondrium.\n\nPrimary center of ossification\n\nThe first site of ossification occurs in the primary center of ossification, which is in the middle of diaphysis (shaft). Then:\n\nFormation of periosteum\n The perichondrium becomes the periosteum. The periosteum contains a layer of undifferentiated cells (osteoprogenitor cells) which later become osteoblasts. \nFormation of bone collar\n The osteoblasts secrete osteoid against the shaft of the cartilage model (Appositional Growth). This serves as support for the new bone.\nCalcification of matrix\n Chondrocytes in the primary center of ossification begin to grow (hypertrophy). They stop secreting collagen and other proteoglycans and begin secreting alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme essential for mineral deposition. Then calcification of the matrix occurs and osteoprogenitor cells that entered the cavity via the periosteal bud, use the calcified matrix as a scaffold and begin to secrete osteoid, which forms the bone trabecula. Osteoclasts, formed from macrophages, break down spongy bone to form the medullary (bone marrow) cavity.\n\nSecondary center of ossification\nAbout the time of birth in mammals, a secondary ossification center appears in each end (epiphysis) of long bones. Periosteal buds carry mesenchyme and blood vessels in and the process is similar to that occurring in a primary ossification center. The cartilage between the primary and secondary ossification centers is called the epiphyseal plate, and it continues to form new cartilage, which is replaced by bone, a process that results in an increase in length of the bone. Growth continues until the individual is about 20 years old or until the cartilage in the plate is replaced by bone. The point of union of the primary and secondary ossification centers is called the epiphyseal line.\n\nAppositional bone growth\nThe growth in diameter of bones around the diaphysis occurs by deposition of bone beneath the periosteum. Osteoclasts in the interior cavity continue to resorb bone until its ultimate thickness is achieved, at which point the rate of formation on the outside and degradation from the inside is constant.\n\nHistology\n\nDuring endochondral ossification, five distinct zones can be seen at the light-microscope level.\n\nFracture healing\nDuring fracture healing, cartilage is often formed and is called callus. This cartilage ultimately develops into new bone tissue through the process of endochondral ossification.

Endochondral ossification is also an essential process during the rudimentary formation of long bones, the growth of the length of long bones, and the natural healing of bone fractures.\n\nGrowth of the cartilage model\nThe cartilage model will grow in length by continuous cell division of chondrocytes, which is accompanied by further secretion of extracellular matrix. This is called interstitial growth.\nThe process of appositional growth occurs when the cartilage model also grows in thickness due to the addition of more extracellular matrix on the peripheral cartilage surface, which is accompanied by new chondroblasts that develop from the perichondrium.\n\nPrimary center of ossification\n\nThe first site of ossification occurs in the primary center of ossification, which is in the middle of diaphysis (shaft). Then:\n\nFormation of periosteum\n The perichondrium becomes the periosteum. The periosteum contains a layer of undifferentiated cells (osteoprogenitor cells) which later become osteoblasts. \nFormation of bone collar\n The osteoblasts secrete osteoid against the shaft of the cartilage model (Appositional Growth). This serves as support for the new bone.\nCalcification of matrix\n Chondrocytes in the primary center of ossification begin to grow (hypertrophy). They stop secreting collagen and other proteoglycans and begin secreting alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme essential for mineral deposition. Then calcification of the matrix occurs and osteoprogenitor cells that entered the cavity via the periosteal bud, use the calcified matrix as a scaffold and begin to secrete osteoid, which forms the bone trabecula. Osteoclasts, formed from macrophages, break down spongy bone to form the medullary (bone marrow) cavity.\n\nSecondary center of ossification\nAbout the time of birth in mammals, a secondary ossification center appears in each end (epiphysis) of long bones. Periosteal buds carry mesenchyme and blood vessels in and the process is similar to that occurring in a primary ossification center. The cartilage between the primary and secondary ossification centers is called the epiphyseal plate, and it continues to form new cartilage, which is replaced by bone, a process that results in an increase in length of the bone. Growth continues until the individual is about 20 years old or until the cartilage in the plate is replaced by bone. The point of union of the primary and secondary ossification centers is called the epiphyseal line.\n\nAppositional bone growth\nThe growth in diameter of bones around the diaphysis occurs by deposition of bone beneath the periosteum.

When bone grows at same rate at both ends, the nutrient artery is perpendicular to the bone. Most other bones (e.g. vertebrae) also have primary ossification centers, and bone is laid down in a similar manner. Secondary centers The secondary centers generally appear at the epiphysis. Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). The epiphyseal arteries and osteogenic cells invade the epiphysis, depositing osteoclasts and osteoblasts which erode the cartilage and build bone, respectively.

She would go on to reprise the role in a voiceover cameo in Luke Cage in 2016, in The Defenders in 2017, a second season of Jessica Jones in 2018, and the series's final season in 2019. In 2014, Taylor played a supporting role in the thriller The Loft, a remake of the 2008 original, alongside fellow Australian Isabel Lucas. In 2016, Taylor portrayed the character Rachel Hill in Gold. In 2018, Taylor appeared in Ladies in Black, an Australian comedy-drama. In 2019, Taylor appeared in Finding Steve McQueen as Molly Murphy, where she starred alongside Travis Fimmel, Forest Whitaker, and William Fichtner.\n\n The second season of the American streaming television series Jessica Jones, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Jones as she takes on a new case after the events surrounding her encounter with Kilgrave. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise.

It was their 1st season under general manager Phil Savage and head coach Romeo Crennel. They posted a record of 6–10, improving upon their 2004 record of 4–12. However, the Browns failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third consecutive season.\n\n The 1995 Cleveland Browns season was the team's 50th season overall and 46th in the National Football League. It ultimately became their final NFL season until 1999, their final season at Cleveland Stadium, and Bill Belichick's final year as Browns head coach. The team finished 5–11, fourth in the AFC Central, though most of the season was overshadowed by the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy. The team was documented in NFL Network's A Football Life. After finishing 11–5 in 1994 under and winning a playoff game for the first time since 1989, the Browns were favored by many to reach Cleveland's first ever Super Bowl. The Browns started by winning three of their first four games and were 4–4 halfway through the season. On November 6, the day after the Browns recorded their fifth loss, a 37–10 blowout against the Oilers, \n\n The 1988 Cleveland Browns season was the team's 39th season with the National Football League. Despite taking the Browns to the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year, head coach Marty Schottenheimer was fired at the end of the 1988 season. He left the Browns having compiled a record of 44–27 (a 62% winning percentage) with the team. (Schottenheimer would later go through a similar scenario with the San Diego Chargers: they fired him after the 2006 season, during which the Chargers posted the best regular-season record in the NFL and then lost their first playoff game.) The Browns finished the season with a 10–6 record, tied for second place in the AFC Central with the Houston Oilers. The Browns were awarded second place by posting a better division record than the Oilers. The Browns clinched a playoff berth for the 4th straight season. In the playoffs, they lost to the Oilers in the Wild Card game, 24–23. As of 2020, this remains the last time the Browns swept the Steelers.\n\n The 1980 Cleveland Browns season was the team's 35th overall, and 31st season in the National Football League. The Browns finished the regular season with eleven wins and five losses, and their first division title in since 1971, winning a tiebreaker with the Houston Oilers. The 1980 Browns were known as the Kardiac Kids for having several games decided in the final moments. The 1980 season was the first time that Cleveland had qualified for the postseason since 1972. Also, for the second straight year, Browns head coach Sam Rutigliano was named NFL Coach of the Year, and quarterback Brian Sipe was named the league's Most Valuable Player. Rallying from a 10–0 first-half deficit against Cincinnati, the Browns came back to beat the Bengals 27–24 and finally snare the Central championship when Don Cockroft kicked the game-winning 22-yard field goal with \n\n owner Art Modell made the decision to move the team from Cleveland, Ohio to Baltimore, Maryland. An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team’s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell’s new team would be regarded as an expansion team. The Baltimore Ravens would begin play in 1996, and the Browns would return to the league in. For record-keeping purposes, the Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998, which is reflected in this list. In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became the second team in NFL history (2008 Detroit Lions) to suffer a 0-16 record. In 2020, the Browns won their first playoff game since their reactivation in 1999, defeating the division champion Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round.\n\nQuestion: who is the most losing team in nfl history\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This coincided with the cultivation of new vines, such as biturica, an ancestor of the Cabernets. These vineyards became so successful that Italy ultimately became an import centre for provincial wines. Depending on the vintage, modern Italy is the world's largest or second-largest wine producer. In 2005, production was about 20% of the global total, second only to France, which produced 26%. In the same year, Italy's share in dollar value of table wine imports into the U.S. was 32%, Australia's was 24%, and France's was 20%. Along with Australia, Italy's market share has rapidly increased in recent years.\n\n Michigan wine refers to any wine that is made in the state of Michigan in the United States. As of 2018, there were 3050 acre under wine-grape cultivation and 148 commercial wineries in Michigan, producing 3 e6USgal of wine. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007. Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA. There are also a few disjunct wineries in every region of the state, including some in the Upper Peninsula that have opened over the past several years. In addition to grape wine, Michigan is a leader in the production of fruit wines such as cherry wine.\n\n Michigan is the fourth largest grape-growing state in America, with over 13,500 acres of vineyards. Much of the state's acreage is planted to varieties like Concord and Niagara, destined for juice production. Wine grapes represent 11% of total vineyard area. The 100,000 short tons of grapes produced in 2005, just 4,600 tons were used for wine-making. However, the proportion of vinifera grapes used in wine–making is increasing. In 2005, the wine industry pressed 2,640 tons of European vinifera grapes, 1,660 tons of hybrid varieties, and 300 tons of American varieties. European grapes grown include Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Pinot noir, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot gris, and Riesling.\n\n York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes, just behind California and Washington. It has AVA's near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island, and in the Hudson Valley has the second-most productive area in the country for growing apples, making it a center for hard cider production, just like New England. Pennsylvania has been growing rye since Germans began to emigrate to the area at the end of the 17th century and required a grain they knew from Germany. Therefore, overall it is not unusual to find New York grown Gewürtztraminer and Riesling, Pennsylvania \n\n Michigan is one of the foremost U.S. states in the production of diverse varieties of bottled, fermented fruit wine. Fruit wine has a long history in Europe, especially in regions such as Poland and the Baltic states where grapes do not easily grow. In Michigan, apple wine and cherry wine are produced in the highest volume, but other fruit juices are fermented as well. Michigan is the leading state for tart cherry production (many Traverse City vineyards were formerly cherry orchards); a number of Michigan wineries produce cherry wine, spice cherry wine, and cherry-grape blends. Michigan is a North American leader in the production of fortified fruit wines and eau-de-vie (fruit brandy).\n\nQuestion: what are the top five wine producing states\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The publisher's title for the almanac for the Tamil year 2012-2013 is Asal No. 28, Nandana Varsha Suddha Vakya Panchangam (அசல் 28—நெ. நந்தன வருஷ சுத்த வாக்கிய பஞ்சாங்கம்). The almanac is popularly referred to as the Pambu Panchangam because the cover page of the almanac carries a prominent image of a snake. The snake referred to here is the Moon in the Panchangam. The image of the snake contains 27 small circles embedded with it. These circles represent the 27 days the Moon takes to complete one full cycle. The reason Moon is represented as a snake is that, due to the pull and push of various planets, its path is like the path left by a snake on sand.\n\n (1491–1570 CE). The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The Karthigai Deepam festival is celebrated during the day of the full moon between November and December, and a huge beacon is lit atop the hill. It can be seen from miles around, and symbolizes the Shiva lingam of fire joining the sky. The event is witnessed by three million pilgrims. On the day preceding each full moon, pilgrims circumnavigate the temple base and the Arunachala hills in a worship called Girivalam, a practice carried out by one million pilgrims yearly.\n\n  In Thailand, two main calendar systems are used alongside each other: the Thai solar calendar, based on the Gregorian calendar and is used for official and most day-to-day purposes, and the Thai lunar calendar (a version of the Buddhist calendar, technically a lunisolar calendar), used for traditional events and Buddhist religious practices. The use of the solar calendar was introduced in 1889 by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), replacing the lunar calendar in official contexts. The beginning of the year was originally marked as April 1st, however this was changed to January 1st in 1941. The days and months now correspond exactly to the Gregorian calendar. The years follow the Buddhist Era, introduced in 1913 to replace the Rattanakosin Era, which in turn replaced the Chula Sakarat in 1889. The reckoning of the Buddhist Era in Thailand is 543 years ahead of the Common \n\n Gregorian calendar) and used by Muslims everywhere to determine the proper day on which to celebrate Islamic holy days and festivals. Its epoch is the Hijra (corresponding to AD 622) With an annual drift of 11 or 12 days, the seasonal relation is repeated approximately every 33 Islamic years. Various Hindu calendars remain in use in the Indian subcontinent, including the Nepali calendars, Bengali calendar, Malayalam calendar, Tamil calendar, Vikrama Samvat used in Northern India, and Shalivahana calendar in the Deccan states. The Buddhist calendar and the traditional lunisolar calendars of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand are also based on an older version of the Hindu calendar.

Nigeria also lost their first group game against Croatia 2–0, but the team got a win in their second game, over Iceland 2–0, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists Argentina. However, they lost the decisive game, and were eliminated after finishing third in the group. Senegal won their opening game against Poland 2–1, and drew their second game against Japan, leaving them needing a draw in their final game against Colombia to be sure of progressing. However, they went down 0–1, and because Japan lost 0–1 as well, Senegal bowed out due to the fair play tiebreaker.\n\n  The Croatia national football team of the late 2010s was thought of as the \"Second Coming of the Golden Generation\";  in reference to the Golden Generation of Croatia from the late 1990s who won the bronze medal in at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Croatia's debut at the World Cup. The team, under the leadership of captain Luka Modrić and the style of play by key players such as Mario Mandžukić, Ivan Rakitić, and Ivan Perišić, reached the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, losing to France 4–2. The squad were praised for their performance at the World Cup.\n\n The teams had met in four previous matches. Their most recent meeting came in a World Cup knockout stage match in 2002, Brazil winning 2–0 to advance to the quarter-finals. That match was also the only time the two sides had previously met in a World Cup. Belgium scored from their first corner of the game in the 13th minute, Vincent Kompany flicked on Eden Hazard's left-wing delivery but the decisive touch came from Fernandinho, who turned the ball past Alisson via his arm. Belgium doubled their lead by breaking from a Brazil corner in the 31st minute, Kevin De Bruyne arrowed a right foot drive across Alisson and into the left corner of the net from the edge of the penalty area after Romelu Lukaku collected the ball, turned and embarked on a 40-yard run with a pass at the end to \n\nGroup C Didier Deschamps lead France to their third World Cup Final in 2018. France finished top of its group ahead of Denmark, Peru and Australia. In the round of sixteen, France faced Argentina in which they beat them 4–3, thanks to great performance by the talented teenager Kylian Mbappé who scored twice for his team. In the quarter-finals, France beat Uruguay 2–0. Belgium managed to beat Brazil 2–1 to face France in the semi-finals, the match ended with a 1–0 win for France through a Samuel Umtiti header from a corner in the second half. After beating Croatia in final, France won their second World Cup title on 15 July 2018, in Luzhniki stadium in Russia. Kylian Mbappé won the \"Best young player\" award, scoring four goals along with Antoine Griezmann who was awarded the Bronze Ball and the Silve Boot as well. In June 2019, the President of the French Football Federation, Noël Le Graët, and French coach Didier Deschamps received the title \"Officier of the Légion d'honneur\"; meanwhile, the 23 players in the 2018 World Cup, all received the title \"Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur\". \n\n The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the Soccer World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II. The tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the World Cup Finals).

It received a change to the front and rear bumper, as well as a slightly revised interior. It also gained the EX-L trim from the refresh with a small increase in price. The base price LX trim starts at $20,295 with a manual transmission, and $20,945 with a continuously variable transmission or CVT. The EX trim increased to $22,140 with a manual transmission, and $22,790 with a CVT. The new EX-L trim starts at $24,440 with a manual transmission, and $25,090 with a CVT. The refresh has changed a few colors as well. The North Shore Blue Pearl color changed to the Aegean Blue Metallic color, the Crystal Black Pearl color has changed to the Jet Black color, and Premium White Pearl has changed to Ivory Pearl. On the EX trim, the secondary interior red color has changed to orange. The CR-Z also gained a few new wheel designs for the refresh. Honda had previously confirmed that a second generation of the CR-Z was under development, possibly for the 2018 model year.\n\n mechanism is also adopted for passenger's seat, realizing a luggage room connected from the front passenger's seat to the rear seat/tailgate.

This theorem can be strengthened: any undirected Hamiltonian graph with at least n2/4 edges is either pancyclic or Kn/2,n/2. There exist n-vertex Hamiltonian directed graphs with n(n + 1)/2 &minus; 3 edges that are not pancyclic, but every Hamiltonian directed graph with at least n(n + 1)/2 &minus; 1 edges is pancyclic. Additionally, every n-vertex strongly connected directed graph in which each vertex has degree at least n (counting incoming and outgoing edges together) is either pancyclic or it is a complete bipartite directed graph.\n\n A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. A minor of a given graph is another graph formed by deleting vertices, deleting edges, and contracting edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. In some versions of graph minor theory the graph resulting from a contraction is simplified by removing self-loops and multiple adjacencies, while in other version multigraphs are allowed, but this variation makes no \n\n{ {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,4} } A graph without self-loops is just a 2-uniform hypergraph: each edge can be considered as a set of the two vertices that it connects. For example, this 2-uniform hypergraph represents a graph with 4 vertices {1,2,3,4} and 3 edges: By the above definition, a matching in a graph is a set M of edges, such that each two edges in M have an empty intersection. This is equivalent to saying that no two edges in M are adjacent to the same vertex; this is exactly the definition of a matching in a graph.\n\n For a simple graph with vertex set , the adjacency matrix is a square n&thinsp;×&thinsp;n matrix A such that its element Aij is one when there is an edge from vertex ui to vertex uj , and zero when there is no edge. The diagonal elements of the matrix are all zero, since edges from a vertex to itself (loops) are not allowed in simple graphs. It is also sometimes useful in algebraic graph theory to replace the nonzero elements with algebraic variables. The same concept can be extended to multigraphs and graphs with loops by storing the number of edges between each two vertices in the corresponding matrix element, and by allowing nonzero diagonal elements. Loops may be counted either once (as a single edge) or twice (as two vertex-edge incidences), as long as a consistent convention is followed. Undirected graphs often use the latter convention of counting loops twice, whereas directed graphs typically use the former convention.\n\nWhere graphs are defined so as to allow loops and multiple edges, a graph without loops or multiple edges is often distinguished from other graphs by calling it a simple graph. ; Where graphs are defined so as to disallow loops and multiple edges, a graph that does have loops or multiple edges is often distinguished from the graphs that satisfy these constraints by calling it a multigraph or pseudograph.  In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. A simple graph contains no loops. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a bouquet.\n\nQuestion: an edge that is between a vertex and itself is a\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The series airs on the Global Television Network. It is re-broadcast in the U.S. as First Comes Love, on Logo. In the first season, the show features a same-sex couple that plans to marry; the arrangements for the wedding are prepared, on two weeks' notice, by a team of wedding planners who are both heterosexual and homosexual. As with typical, Western heterosexual weddings, the general idea is to create a unique experience that reflects the personality of the people to be wed, while adding a special gay sensibility. The spirit of the program is one of fun. In the second season, with new host Elvira Kurt, the stories concentrate more on the couples than the wedding planning process. The team of wedding planners has been reduced to one: Fern Cohen. This season debuted on Logo in February 2007. Through interviews with the family members, the show also explores the issue of same-sex marriage and its effect on the social fabric.\n\n Little America is an American anthology streaming television series produced for Apple TV+.

They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause, act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, administer oaths of office to public officials, take depositions and issue subpoenas. New Hampshire justices of the peace are also authorized, upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit, to issue arrest warrants, search warrants, administrative inspection warrants and by court appointment, to fix and receive bail in criminal cases.\n\n In the state of Queensland, a \"justice of the peace (qualified)\" has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and, in conjunction with another justice of the peace (qualified) constitute a magistrates' court for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings. Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates' court), usually in remote Aboriginal communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate. In Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate's Court). A commissioner for declarations (C.dec) has powers limited to witnessing documents, witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits, witnessing and administering oaths and affirmations. The first woman to become a JP in Queensland was Matilda (Maud) Hennessey of Mackay on 24 April 1918.\n\n Justices of the peace existed in Ireland prior to 1922, sitting in a bench under the supervision of resident magistrates at petty sessions to try minor offences summarily, and with a county court judge (in his capacity of chairman of quarter sessions) and jury to try more serious offences at quarter sessions. In the Irish Free State the position was effectively abolished by the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 and permanently abolished by the Courts of Justice Act 1924. Their judicial powers were replaced by full-time, salaried, legally qualified district justices (now called district judges) and their quasi-judicial powers by unpaid lay peace commissioners. Peace commissioners may sign statutory declarations, and may issue summons and search warrants to the Garda Síochána (Irish police). A peace commissioner cannot witness the signature of an affidavit; that function is performed by a commissioner for oaths. A commissioner for oaths can perform every function a peace commissioner can, plus more.\n\n In Belgium, the justices of the peace (vredegerecht, justice de paix, friedensgericht) function as the small claims courts in the country's judicial system; they stand at the bottom of the Belgian judicial hierarchy and only handle civil cases. There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. The judgments made by the justices of the peace can, with some exceptions, be appealed to the tribunals of first instance.\n\n  In some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction, a magistrate, or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers. Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office. The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a trial de novo before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered. A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages.\n\nQuestion: what is the job of justice of the peace\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Oscar stars Sylvester Stallone, in a rare attempt at a comedic role, as Angelo \"Snaps\" Provolone, a mob boss who promises his dying father that he will leave the world of crime and become an honest businessman. Alongside Stallone, the film's cast includes Marisa Tomei, Ornella Muti, Tim Curry and Chazz Palminteri. Its score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. According to Landis, Oscar was stylistically influenced by older Hollywood comedies, particularly those belonging to the \"screwball\" genre, that were popular during the period in which the film takes place. Oscar was released in the United States on April 26, 1991, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n The 8th Academy Awards were held on March 5, 1936, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California. They were hosted by Frank Capra. This was the first year in which the gold statuettes were called \"Oscars\". The category of Best Dance Direction was introduced this year. The DGA successfully lobbied for its elimination three years later. Mutiny on the Bounty became the last film to date to win Best Picture and nothing else (following The Broadway Melody and Grand Hotel), and the only film to receive three nominations for Best Actor. This was the second and last year that write-in votes were allowed at the Oscars. A Midsummer Night's Dream became the only film to win a write-in Oscar, taking Best Cinematography. Miriam Hopkins' Best Actress nomination for Becky Sharp was the first acting nomination for a color film.\n\n The 54th Academy Awards were presented March 29, 1982, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The ceremonies were presided over by Johnny Carson. This year's nominations also marked the second time (after 1967) that three different films were nominated for the \"Big Five\" Academy Awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay (one for Adapted Screenplay and two for Original Screenplay). This also marked the first year that the award for Best Makeup was presented. This was the last year until the 2005 Oscars where all five Best Picture nominations were also nominated for Best Director. Chariots of Fire became the last film to win Best Picture and not win for directing until Driving Miss Daisy. Chariots of Fire won four awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Raiders of the Lost Ark with five awards, On Golden Pond and Reds with three, Arthur with two, and An American Werewolf in London, Close Harmony, Crac, Genocide, Mephisto, and Violet with one.\n\n The first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings, for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system \n\n The 47th Academy Awards were presented Tuesday, April 8, 1975, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, California, honoring the best films of 1974. The ceremonies were presided over by Bob Hope, Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., and Frank Sinatra. This was the last year NBC aired the ceremonies before ABC secured broadcasting rights, which they still hold to this day. The success of The Godfather Part II was notable; it received twice as many Oscars as its predecessor (six) and duplicated its feat of three Best Supporting Actor nominations (as of the 93rd Academy Awards, the last film to receive three nominations in a single acting category). Between the two of them, father and son Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola won four awards, with Carmine winning for Best Original Dramatic Score (with Nino Rota) and Francis for Picture, Director, and Best Screenplay Adapted from Other Material (with Mario Puzo). This was the only Oscars where all nominees in one category (where the category had five nominees) were released by the same studio: all five Best Costume Design nominations were for films released by Paramount Pictures.\n\nQuestion: who won the oscar for best picture in 1976\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was placed in several other top staying races including the Brisbane Cup and Moonee Valley Cup (twice). After winning the Doomben Cup Bore Head had a further 31 race starts without a victory. After winning the 1965 Caulfield Cup, many thought he stood a good chance in the Melbourne Cup of that year (won by Light Fingers, trained by Bart Cummings). But he lost his chance when the horse in front of him fell, taking Bore Head and another horse down in a three-horse tumble. Jockey Fred Clarke was convinced that Bore Head was on his way to winning the cup that day. The following year he placed twelfth in the race behind another Cummings trained horse, Red Handed.\n\n Think Big started eight times at age two, earning just one win. As a three-year-old he had fifteen starts for five wins. His third to Igloo in the Brisbane Cup was an indication of better things to come. The popular Bart Cummings trained mare Leilani was the favourite for the 1974 Melbourne Cup but she was run down in the last fifty metres by her stablemate Think Big under jockey Harry White. The win gave Cummings his fourth Melbourne Cup win and his third quinella of the race. Following his second last in the lead up MacKinnon Stakes, Think Big started at 33–1 in the 1975 Melbourne Cup, assigned high-weight of 58 kg. He had not won a race since his victory the previous year. But at his favourite course and distance, again under jockey Harry White, he fought off a challenge from stablemate Holiday Waggon to record his second win.\n\n Prior to the Cup, Viewed won the AJC Listed Japan Racing Association (JRA) Plate on 30 April 2008 and two months later he qualified by winning the Group 2 Brisbane Cup on 9 June 2008. In the 2008 Melbourne Cup on 4 November, Viewed defeated the Luca Cumani-trained Bauer in a photo finish. The finish was so close that the electronic timing devices, which are placed inside the saddle cloths, recorded that Bauer had completed the course one-hundredth of a second faster than Viewed. Viewed was trained by Bart Cummings and was ridden by Blake Shinn. It was Shinn's first Melbourne Cup winner and the 12th for Cummings. It was the fourth time Cummings had won the Cup in partnership with Dato Tan Chin Nam, the owner. Viewed's Melbourne Cup was the 250th Group 1 training victory for Bart Cummings. Viewed was an outsider in the Melbourne Cup, and paid $41.00 on the totalisator in New South Wales.\n\n The 1965 Melbourne Cup was a two-mile handicap horse race which took place on Tuesday, 2 November 1965. The race, run over 3200 m, at Flemington Racecourse. The race won by Light Fingers, trained by Bart Cummings who won the first of what would end up being a record 12 Melbourne Cups. Ziema ran second also trained by Cummings making it the first of five times he trained the quinella.\n\n The Group 1 Melbourne Cup was the richest greyhound race in the Australia and was inaugurated in 1956.

Early efforts at police reform often involved external commissions, such as the Wickersham Commission, that spelled out reforms but left to the police to implement them, often with limited success. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions under the Warren Court led to important changes in policing, with respect to civil rights and constitutional law. Mapp v. Ohio in 1961 and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions. Mapp v. Ohio found that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" may not be used in criminal prosecutions. Miranda v. Arizona required that criminal suspects must be informed \n\n The Court had decided two years earlier in Mapp v. Ohio that evidence seized in the course of an illegal search was inadmissible in a criminal trial in a state court. The Court extended that holding in this case, addressing the standard for deciding what are the fruits of an illegal search in state criminal trials. Clark's opinion addressed “the specific question as to whether Mapp requires the exclusion of evidence in this case which the California District Court of Appeal has held to be lawfully seized.” Unlike the previous case, where the search was clearly unreasonable, the District Court had found that the seizure of the drugs in the Kers’ apartment was allowed as being incident to an otherwise lawful arrest. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to give lower courts guidance on decide when evidence is the fruit of an unlawful search or seizure. The Court declared that the standards of reasonableness are the same under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments applying in Federal and State courts. Clark interpreted the Court's precedents in determining if the search of the Kers’ apartment and car were reasonable.\n\n In Mapp v. Ohio the Supreme Court deemed it unconstitutional to use the evidence of pornography gathered from the police officers when they illegally searched Mapp's house. This ruling was based on the protection from \"an unreasonable search or seizure\" stated in the Fourth Amendment. However, the exclusionary rule is not cited in the Constitution, but rather a Supreme Court implication. The Supreme Court \"found that the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law and the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures could not be properly enforced as long as illegally obtained evidence continued to be presented in court.\" This realization of the Court is what allowed Dollree Mapp and her lawyer to make a \"motion to suppress\" the evidence. In other words, having the judge determine whether the evidence was gathered legally. In \n\n took the paper from Mapp. The officer found evidence of pornography in Mapp's house. As a result, Mapp was \"charged under an Ohio law that made possession of obscene material a felony.\" Mapp was sentenced with 7 years in prison. While on bond, however, she appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which rejected her case. She then appealed to the U.S Supreme Court \"on the basis of freedom of expression\" and they accepted her case. The Supreme Court Justices all \"drew laughs from the courtroom gallery while leaving no doubt how absurd they found Ohio’s obscenity statute.\" Initially, there was unanimous agreement that the Ohio obscenity law was not in line with the \n\n Dollree Mapp (October 30, 1923 – October 31, 2014) was the appellant in the Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio (1961). She argued that her right to privacy in her home, the Fourth Amendment, was violated by police officers who entered her house with what she thought to be a fake search warrant. Mapp also argued that the Exclusionary Rule was violated due to the collection of the evidence that was found after the police had entered her house without a convincing search warrant according to Mapp's experience. In the Supreme Court case, Mapp v. Ohio, the decision was made in favor of Mapp, in a 6-3 ruling. As a result of the ruling in Mapp v. Ohio, Mapp's conviction was voided. A few years after Mapp v. Ohio was ruled upon, Mapp was convicted again, but this time for the possession of narcotics. After her prison sentence had ended, she began working \"for a non-profit that provided legal assistance to inmates.\"\n\nQuestion: who was involved in the mapp vs ohio case\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The character originally appeared in the soap opera EastEnders from 2000 to 2005, and 2010 to 2016, in which she is usually called \"Kat\". The series of Kat and Alfie: Redwater was created because in EastEnders, Kat and her husband Alfie (Shane Richie) had their marriage on track and needed more stories, and Kat had been \"going round in a cycle of bad self-worth every few years, all down to the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager from her Uncle Harry.\" It was decided that Kat should be shown as a survivor and move on to the next stage of her \n\n her daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan), who had been brought up to believe that Kat was her sister), the domestic abuse of Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) by husband Trevor (Alex Ferns) (which involved marital rape and culminated in Trevor's death after he tried to kill Little Mo in a fire), Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) giving birth at the age of 15 and then putting her baby up for adoption, and Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) prostitution, agoraphobia and drug addiction.

In flashback, young Dermott is played by Eoin Daly. In EastEnders episodes broadcast in January 2016, Kathleen discovers she gave birth to a son, Luke, after she passed out during the birth of her daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan). A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), explains that Kat's family, fearing that the child would turn out like his paedophile father, Kat's uncle, Harry Slater (Michael Elphick), handed him to the nuns in the convent where he was born.

In magazines, it is one of the various symbols used to indicate the end of an article. In Unicode, it is represented as character. Its graphic form varies, as it may be a hollow or filled rectangle or square. In AMS-LaTeX, the symbol is automatically appended at the end of a proof environment  ...  . It can also be obtained from the commands ,   or   (the latter causes the symbol to be right aligned). It is sometimes called a \"Halmos finality symbol\" or \"halmos\" \n\n the mathematician Paul Halmos, who first used it in a mathematical context in 1950. He got the idea of using it from seeing it was being used to indicate the end of articles in magazines. In his memoir I Want to Be a Mathematician, he wrote the following: \"The symbol is definitely not my invention — it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics. It is the symbol that sometimes looks like ▯, and is used to indicate an end, usually the end of a proof. It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.\"\n\n ◌͠◌ – double tilde ; double sub/superscript diacritics ; ◌̧ ̧ – double cedilla ; ◌̨ ̨ – double ogonek ; ◌̈ ̈ – double diaeresis ; ◌ͅͺ – double ypogegrammeni Among the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the Latin script are: The tilde, dot, comma, titlo, apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses. Not all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the Wali language of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects \n\n French, Portuguese and in Catalan it is a softening c, indicating 's-' not 'k-' pronunciation ; the tilde (Señor, João), in Spanish indicating palatalised n, and Portuguese indicating nasal a and o (although in Spanish and most source languages, the tilde is not considered a diacritic over the letter n but rather as an integral part of the distinct letter ñ; in Portuguese the sound is represented by \"nh\") the háček (as in Karel Čapek), often also called the haček in English (adapted from \"háček\", the Czech name ), as Č|Č/č, Š|Š/š, Ř|Ř/ř (only in Czech), Ž|Ž/ž broadly turns \"c\" \"s\" \"r\" \"z\" into English \"\" \"\" \"\" \n\n A T-square is a technical drawing instrument used by draftsmen primarily as a guide for drawing horizontal lines on a drafting table. It may also guide a set square to draw vertical or diagonal lines. Its name comes from its resemblance to the letter T. T-squares come in varying sizes, common lengths being 18 inch, 24 inch, 30 inch, 36 inch and 42 inch. T-squares are also used to measure and cut drywall. Drywall T-squares are typically made of aluminium and have a 48 inch long tongue. Higher-end table saws are often equipped with T-square fences. These table saw fences are attached to a rail only on the front side of the table unlike traditional fences which clamp to both the front and the rear of the table. A T-square has two components—the long shaft called the \"blade\" and the short shaft called the \"stock\" or \"head\". The T-square usually has a transparent edge made of plastic which should be free of nicks and cracks in order to provide smooth, straight lines.

It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia.\n\nSummary\nThe story takes place in the fictional town of Upper Darby, Rhode Island in 2004. Anna Fitzgerald's older sister, Kate, suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer. Anna was born as a savior sister specifically so she could save Kate's life through the donation of her umbilical cord blood. At first it is successful, but the cancer continues to relapse throughout Kate's life.\n\nAnna is usually willing to donate whatever Kate needs, but when she turns 13, she is told that she will have to donate one of her kidneys due to Kate's kidney failure. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney.\n\nAt first Sara, their mother, believes that Anna's decision is led by a simple need of attention, but Anna is serious and refuses to withdraw her complaint, so the case has to be discussed in front of a judge. Having been a civil attorney before becoming a mother, Sara decides to represent herself. The judge assigned to the case is Judge De Salvo, who the year before lost his twelve-year-old daughter because of a drunk driver.\n\nRecognizing that it is impossible for Anna and Sara to be together during the trial, Judge De Salvo hires Julia Romano, the court-appointed guardian ad litem whose job it is to decide what would be best for Anna. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior.\n\nDuring the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. The on-call firefighter, who happens to be Brian, arrives at the scene, retrieving an unconscious and severely injured Anna from the wreckage of the crushed car.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor informs Sara and Brian that Anna is brain-dead and says that they will need to act quickly if they wish to donate her organs. An injured Campbell approves the procedure and Kate's life is saved. Sara and Brian are devastated and struggle to cope for the next eight years after Anna's life support machines are shut off. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her.\n\nCharacters\nKate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. She is the older sister of Anna, and the middle child out of all three Fitzgerald siblings. She sometimes finds all the attention on her stifling. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one.\nAndromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. At first Anna was only meant to donate her umbilical cord, but in response to Kate's relapses, Anna repeatedly donates blood, marrow, and eventually, an organ to her. She is thirteen years old at the time the novel takes place, and seeks to be medically emancipated from her parents. She believes that this legal support is necessary to help her resist the growing pressure on her to donate a kidney. She is the main protagonist of the novel.\nJesse Fitzgerald - The oldest Fitzgerald child. Throughout most of the novel, he is a delinquent teenager, but eventually reforms after a confrontation with his father.\nSara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. She tries her hardest to keep her oldest, ill, daughter alive and well. Sara refuses to accept the idea that Kate is likely to die, and in doing so she neglects the needs of her two other children, whom she keeps seeing in relation to Kate. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. \nBrian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. He is fond of astronomy and becomes torn between his daughters, and his wife, during Anna's emancipation trial. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. He also shows concern for his son, and is the one to confront him about his troubling behavior. After Anna's death, he too needs a lot of time to cope with it.\nJulia Romano - The court-appointed, guardian ad litem, whose job it is to decide what is best for Anna. She also often advises Anna regarding medical emancipation. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why.\nCampbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. He believes that she should have control over her own body, and eventually obtains medical power of attorney over her, when the case is successful. He personally uses a service dog, which others find mysterious, because he does not tell anyone why. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after.\nSuzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in-law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters.\nDr. Harrison Chance - Kate's oncologist.\nJudge DeSalvo - The presiding judge over Anna's medical emancipation case. \nIsobel \"Izzy\" Romano - Julia's twin sister and roommate. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. She is very close to her sister and as such despises Campbell for having left Julia. \nTaylor Ambrose - Kate's boyfriend. He is diagnosed with myeloid leukemia and meets her at the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy. Kate has some of her happiest times with him, as he's one of the only people with whom she's been able to fully relate. After they go to a prom, Kate comes to believe that Taylor has ceased contact with her. She becomes estranged from her mother after learning the truth, which is that Sara learned about Taylor's death and concealed it from Kate, fearing that the grief would rob Kate of the will to live.\n\nDevelopment history\n\nPublication history\nPicoult, Jodi. My Sister's Keeper. Atria Books: New York, 2004; /.\n\nCritical reception\n\nIn review for The Washington Post, Katherine Arie described some of the characters as unconvincing, such as Brian, who is \"too good to be true\", Jesse, \"a poster child for self-destructive behavior\", and Kate, who is \"as weak and wispy on the page as she's supposed to be in life\", but ultimately called the book \"a thrill to read\".\n\nIn 2009 the American Library Association (ALA) and the office for Intellectual Freedom named My Sister's Keeper the seventh out of ten most frequently challenged books in the US. Schools and libraries attempted to ban the book due to its mature themes.\n\nAdaptations\n\nNew Line Cinema adapted My Sister's Keeper into a feature film, which was directed by Nick Cassavetes and released on June 26, 2009. It starred Cameron Diaz as Sara and Alec Baldwin as Campbell. Kate and Anna were played respectively by Sofia Vassilieva and Abigail Breslin.\n\nThe film features an alternate ending and more emphasis on certain subplots while entirely eliminating others. This was against the wishes of Picoult.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMy Sister's Keeper at the author's site\n\n2004 American novels\nAmerican novels adapted into films\nMedical ethics in fiction\nNovels about cancer\nNovels about siblings\nNovels by Jodi Picoult\nNovels set in Rhode Island\nAtria Publishing Group books\n\nWhen Cathy Mooney was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma, the myeloma program at Winship was just beginning to take off.

More than 200 Winship patients participate in the Phase I Clinical Trials Unit directed by Donald Harvey.\n“That’s a huge group that we are able to see in one city,” says Ajay Nooka, assistant professor of hematology and medical oncology and part of the hematology care team at Winship. In addition to caring for patients, Nooka, who specializes in cancer epidemiology, structures and oversees many of Winship’s clinical trials and assesses their outcomes.\nThe large patient population and high rate of clinical trial enrollment is a gold mine of data for researchers.\n“The ultimate goal is to see where we stand in terms of treatment for multiple myeloma progress and what changes we can make to further improvements in patient outcomes,” Nooka says.\nAnother advantage for Winship’s multiple myeloma team is Atlanta’s large population of African Americans, who are twice as likely as the white population to be diagnosed with the disease.\nIn November, the FDA approved elotuzumab as part of an innovative immune-based therapy treatment for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. That was the third myeloma drug approved by the FDA within the previous month and the fourth approved within the last year.\nThat’s good news for patients like Quincy Washington, who was 42 when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2007.\nAt first his doctor suspected rheumatoid arthritis, but then sent Washington to an oncologist, where he learned about myeloma for the first time. The disease typically strikes African American men at a younger age than any other patient group.\nWashington happened to have a friend who specializes in oncology at Winship, and that’s how he discovered that he could get the most leading-edge care within miles of his home in Lithonia. He began treatment for multiple myeloma immediately, including enrollment in a clinical trial.\nCathy Mooney shares her multiple myeloma patient story. Treatment for multiple myeloma is the topic very relevant to even those who consider themselves a “health nut” or a “gym rat”. This article shares a story of how one health-conscious young lady had to undergo a treatment for multiple myeloma at Emory.\nCathy Mooney didn’t need a wake-up call. In 2002, at 48 years old, “I felt like I was at the top of my game,” she says. “I was exercising regularly, walking four miles five days a week. I was following a great diet. I had really never been in better health.” But a routine physical exam turned up some troubling results, and a long series of visits to specialists and tests followed. After a frustrating three months, Mooney heard two words she never knew before: multiple myeloma.\n“I learned that the survival rate was three to five years,” she says. “We were devastated. I felt wonderful; I did not feel sick.” Mooney received an advise to travel from her home in Thomasville, Georgia, to Little Rock, Arkansas. There was a center specializing in myeloma.\nAlthough her cancer could be coaxed into remission, it kept coming back.\nIn 2008, Mooney and her husband flew north to visit myeloma specialists at Sloan Kettering and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The latter was Ken Anderson, who had been following Lonial’s progress at Winship. Both told Mooney that she could get the best, most current treatment in her home state of Georgia.\nSince Mooney’s diagnosis, her twin daughter and son have married and had children of their own. Her five grandchildren are a constant delight.\nMultiple myeloma begins in the bone marrow with plasma cells going haywire.

And then, the passing out. She was getting sick and it was happening fast. For a young, vibrant, working wife and mother that was terrifying.\nA trip to the emergency room led to a rapid diagnosis of multiple myeloma — a cancer of the blood — and a recommendation from her doctor to seek treatment at Emory and Winship.\nMobley was so ill that she got to Emory University Hospital in an ambulance. And that’s when all the ripping and running slowed way, way down — at least for a while.\nAs cancer goes, multiple myeloma is a bit of a misfit.\nFor one thing, it’s rare. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 30,000 new cases of myeloma will be diagnosed this year, trailing far behind the most common cancers — breast and lung — each of which will derail more than 220,000 lives. That’s stiff competition for research funding and awareness.\nFor another, it’s mysterious. Multiple myeloma begins in the bone marrow with plasma cells going haywire. But experts aren’t entirely sure how the process starts or what the key risk factors are. The disease is most common in people over 65, men are slightly more vulnerable and that African Americans are more than twice as likely as white Americans to get it. But we don’t know why.\nence between multiple myeloma and pretty much all other types of cancer is that the life expectancy for myeloma patients has doubled in the past decade. All thanks to treatments developed and tested at Emory’s Winship Cancer Institute.\nLast November, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the fourth new myeloma drug to be green-lighted within one year —three of those within one monthv—and all four were tested in clinical trials at Winship.\n“There’s no other story like that in cancer,” says Sagar Lonial, Winship’s chief medical officer and chair of the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology in the School of Medicine.\nSince his arrival at Emory and Winship in 1997, Lonial has built the multiple myeloma program into one of the best and most sought-after in the country. A team of experts who specialize in the disease leads this program. As Georgia’s only National Cancer Institute–designated cancer center and one of just 69 in the US, Winship offers patients the chance to be treated in the same building where research is taking place. There are three floors dedicated to basic science and three to clinical care.\nRegimen of medications calibrated to keep the cancer at bay and send it into remission for a long time.\nIt’s that last phase that has put Winship’s approach ahead of other myeloma treatment centers. Instead of a one-by-one, trial-and-error approach to drug therapy, Lonial has advocated a full court press. It allowed to hit the residual cancer with a simultaneous three-drug combination.\n“That concept of combination therapy is one that our center is focused on and one that benefited her early on,” Lonial says.\nWhen Lonial joined Emory’s hematology and oncology department nearly two decades ago, other researchers might have seen a department struggling with turnover and inadequate resources. With the encouragement of a mentor—Kenneth Anderson, probably the best-known myeloma specialist in the world—Lonial saw an opportunity to build a program, from the ground up.\nThe bottom floor of Winship houses the Clinical Trials Unit, the key to the multiple myeloma program’s growth and success. Within a few years, Lonial had recruited top scientists and clinicians, including Boise, and was testing new classes of drugs in Phase I clinical trials. They proved to be game changers.\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood that develops when normal, antibody-producing plasma cells become malignant and their growth spirals out of control. They build up in the bone marrow until they crowd out healthy blood cells. They can form lesions and tumors in multiple bones, hence the condition’s name.\nBut the cancerous cells also secrete protein and, like normal cells, they’re engineered to do this in a particular way—the protein assembled and folded just so. When that assembly goes awry, as it does in myeloma cells, the malformed proteins are broken down by proteasomes—protein complexes whose job it is to get rid of problem proteins by degrading them—and that opens up the pipeline for more myeloma cell production.\nAbout ten years ago, scientists discovered that if you interfere with the proteasome’s work—allowing the abnormal proteins to accumulate—the cancerous cells, which in a sense are trying to function normally, will self-destruct. Rapidly.\n“Proteasome is part of quality control, so if you inhibit that, and all these mid-folded proteins build up, that causes stress, and the cell kills itself,” Boise explains.\nLearn more about Tamara’s story here.\nWhen Eric Berry first learned he had a type of blood cancer known as Hodgkin lymphoma, the Kansas City Chiefs football player returned to his home and family in Georgia and sought treatment at Winship Cancer Institute. Berry became a patient of Dr. Christopher R. Flowers, a Winship hematologist specializing in lymphoma and director of the Emory Lymphoma Program, and started regular chemotherapy treatments at Winship that lasted for several months. During that time, nurse Stephanie Jones took care of Berry and got to know both him and his family. It turned out that nurse Stephanie made quite a lasting impression on Berry. At the end of July, he returned to Kansas City to resume practices with his team and during his first press conference, he gave a shout-out to Jones and credited her as being the “real MVP” of his treatment. Jones says she’s proud of the honor and admiring of Berry’s determination to beat the cancer. Winship is fortunate to have a dedicated oncology nursing staff that demonstrates patient- and family-centered commitment, care and collaboration. All Winship nurses are specially trained to administer complicated chemotherapy regimens and implement steps for symptom management. As Stephanie shows, our Winship compassion is what is remembered.\nSee Eric Berry and Stephanie’s story on KCTV-TV Kansas City.\nI was diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) in 2007, and I underwent six rounds of chemotherapy, which thankfully, resulted in remission. To celebrate the journey and one year of remission, my family and I planned a trip to England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. We were so excited to celebrate! We planned to leave on a Sunday in June, and I had one more appointment on the Friday before we left. At that appointment, I found out I had relapsed; the leukemia was back. Absolutely devastated, we decided to postpone the trip and start treatment right away instead.\nI was evaluated for a bone marrow transplant, and they found a perfect match who was available and willing to donate. By God’s grace, I received my transplant on August 15, 2009. All I knew at that point was that my donor was male, 21 years old, and from another country. I remember writing him a card and sending it through the Be The Match organization to let him know how my recovery was going. Because he was an international donor, we couldn’t exchange information for two years. After two long years of anonymous letters, my donor Johannes and I were able to learn each other’s names and locations. We immediately made contact and began emailing. It was so incredible to be able to talk with the man who saved my life! How could I even begin to put my gratitude into words?!\nMy family and I decided to re-schedule the trip we had postponed for summer 2012, and we couldn’t wait to finally go – we had so much more to celebrate! That trip was symbolic of God’s healing and grace, and it became even more significant when Johannes and his dad agreed to meet us in London to spend a few days together.\nIt was an experience of a lifetime! There I was, sitting in a London pub, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the man who gave me the gift of life. It was so amazing to spend a few days exploring London with Johannes and his dad Bernd. God is so good – He healed me and blessed me with two new family members from Germany. What an incredible gift!\nFast forward three years, a dozen Skype sessions, tons of emails, and countless postcards – Johannes surprised me with the news that he and his girlfriend Tina were coming to Georgia to celebrate the 5-year anniversary of my transplant — I call it my transplantiversary. They arrived on Aug. 15 and we spent the weekend camping out at Lake Lanier with friends and family. I loved every minute of it!\nWe also took Johannes and Tina to tour Winship and meet some of my doctors and practitioners, which was an amazing experience. We went to the hospital and showed Johannes around the unit where I spent so much of my time surrounding the transplant. God is so faithful – it felt like I had come full circle to be able to return to Emory with my donor and celebrate complete healing. What a beautiful experience!\nI will forever be connected to Johannes and his family, and it is all because he joined the bone marrow registry in Germany. Through God’s grace, Johannes gave me the gift of life, for which I could never fully express my gratitude. My prayer and my hope is that others will be inspired to join the registry as well – there are so many people who need this life-saving gift, and you could be the match for them! The registration requires a simple cheek swab, and you can request a kit at BetheMatch.org. You, too, could save a life!\nErin Blonshine lives in Gwinnett County and works as a hospital teacher in the School Program at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. She felt called to work with children and families experiencing challenges similar to her own. Erin feels blessed by the unique opportunity to serve others in her role at CHOA.\nErin enjoys spending time with her family, including her one month old niece and her two-and-a-half year old nephew. She also loves to travel, hang out with her friends, and relax at Lake Burton.\nTamara Mobley, 38 and married with 8 and 12 year old sons, has been battling multiple myeloma for five years now under the care of Dr. Sagar Lonial at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. She went on a clinical trial at Winship in order to get the most advanced drug for treating this blood cancer. Because of that trial, the drug is now FDA-approved and is helping Tamara maintain her active life.\nClinical trials are responsible for most advances in medical treatment, but they can’t take place without volunteer participants like Tamara. Unfortunately, there are still many misconceptions about clinical trials that keep people from participating.\nFor instance, some believe joining a clinical trial is a last resort in the treatment process, which was not the case for Tamara and many other Winship patients. For Tamara, enrolling in a clinical trial was a good option once her standard cancer drugs stopped working.\nIn the video below, Fox 5 Atlanta talked to Tamara and Dr. Lonial about the decision to participate in a clinical trial.\nIt is important to speak with your physician about participating in a clinical trial. For more information about a specific trial, please contact the lead research coordinator.\nI was diagnosed with breast cancer at the young age of 33. A cancer diagnosis always comes as a shock, but it’s particularly unexpected at that age. Because my mother had breast cancer at a young age, a new provider sent me for my base line screening mammogram and that turned out to be my first and only mammogram. I can say without a doubt that a mammogram saved my life.\nI was treated here at Winship, by Dr. Toncred Styblo and Dr. David Lawson. Twenty-five years later, all three of us are still here. I came back to Winship six years ago, but not as a patient. I took a job as supervisor of business operations for the Glenn Family Breast Center at Winship, and I am one of the organizers of the Celebration of Living event coming up this Sat., June 21.\nThat’s why the Celebration of Living event is so near and dear to my heart. This is a chance to get together with other survivors, and discover that part of being a survivor is learning that it’s ok to let fun and humor back into your life. Learn to let the fear go and not let it rule your life. Coming to the Celebration of Living event can be a first step toward getting back out into the world, or it can be a continuation of your on-going journey. We all know that battling cancer has very dark moments, but I hope we can bring some hope and lightness into your life.\nSo I invite all cancer survivors, their family members and friends to come share this special day. There will be workshops for the mind, body and soul, as well as music, food and companionship. It’s free and open to all. Detailed information is available on our website.\nI see more and more people surviving cancer because of new and better treatments and earlier detection. In the time since I got my screening mammogram, the technology has greatly improved. Emory and Winship are now offering state-of-the-art 3D mammograms (also called tomosynthesis) at no additional charge above the cost of standard mammograms, so that all women can benefit from this more precise screening technology. For more information about this new service and where it’s available, check out this video about 3D mammography at Emory Healthcare.\nFor some, the idea of living a normal lifespan with cancer as a chronic disease is a reality.\nMy hope is that one day, all cancer patients will enjoy a lifetime of survivorship.\nMary Brookhart grew up in Ohio before moving to Georgia to get away from the snow. There she enjoyed a 20+ year career in advertising and design. In 2008, looking for something more rewarding, Mary returned to Winship, this time, not as a patient, but as supervisor of business operations for the Emory Glenn Family Breast Center. Besides serving as an advocate for breast cancer patients, Mary coordinates screenings for mammograms and the Emory’s Breast Cancer Seminar for the Newly Diagnosed breast cancer patient. She currently lives in rural Conyers, with her husband of 37 years, and their three horses.\nAs we near the end of 2013, it’s common to reflect on events from the past year, both the challenging and the inspiring. For the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, it was an exciting year as strides were made in many areas, including enrolling over 800 patients in clinical trials, breaking ground on the Emory Proton Therapy Center, performing our 4,000th bone marrow and stem cell transplant and continuing to pioneer exciting research discoveries, such as the development of drug therapies aimed to cure brain cancer.\nWinship opened its doors in 1937 and was the first center to provide advanced care for cancer patients in the Southeast. Today, as Georgia’s only National Cancer Institute – designated cancer center, Winship is among the nation’s leading institutions as it continues to pursue a future where cancer ceases to exist.\nThrough the generosity of donations of any size, as well as fundraising events like the Winship Win the Fight 5K, the physicians, staff and researchers at Winship are working harder than ever to achieve that goal for the residents of Georgia and beyond. The video below recaps some of the 2013 achievements as we prepare to welcome 2014 with eagerness and hopefulness!\n\n Phoebe Halliwell (played by Alyssa Milano) is the third sister who initially receives the power of premonition, which enables her to see into the past or the future. To make up for initially receiving a passive power, Phoebe develops martial arts skills to better assist her sisters when fighting evil. As the series progresses, she also gains the active powers of levitation and empathy and her premonitions become more powerful, enabling her to communicate with people in the future and share with other people. Phoebe starts out as the youngest and most rebellious of the sisters. Because of her free-spirited nature, she often comes into major conflicts with Prue but the two eventually mend their relationship. She later becomes the middle sister after Prue dies and the series introduces their younger half sister Paige. One of the recurring struggles for Phoebe is her attempt to find a career and true love. In the final season she falls in love and marries Coop, a cupid that was initially sent to her to find love.\n\n Professional football player Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges) is released by his team, the Outlaws. Aging, injured and in need of money, he is contacted by an old acquaintance, the shady gambler and nightclub owner Jake Wise (James Woods), who wants Terry to find Jake's girlfriend Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward), daughter of the Outlaws' owner. Jake claims that Jessie assaulted him, stole money and fled. Terry is reluctant to take on the job, but needs the money and knows Wise is capable of blackmailing him. Terry gets in touch with Jessie's mother (Jane Greer), ostensibly to find out where Jessie can be found, but mainly to convince Mrs. Wyler and her \n\n Forty-one-year-old Nadezhda Petrukhina (Maya Bulgakova), a once heroic World War II Soviet fighter pilot, is now living a quiet, but disappointingly ordinary life as a school principal at a construction-oriented trade school. Beloved and revered by the generation that experienced the Great Patriotic War, Nadezdha struggles to connect with the generation that followed hers. Nadezhda disapproves of her adopted daughter's choices in men, and worries that her daughter, Tanya (Zhanna Bolotova), unaware of her own adoption, might discover the truth. Conversations between the two emphasize their tense, understated and ambiguous relationship.

In April 1992, John appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium, performing \"The Show Must Go On\" with the remaining members of Queen, and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses and Queen's remaining members. In September, John performed \"The One\" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards and closed the ceremony performing \"November Rain\" with Guns N' Roses. The following year, he released Duets, which featured collaborations with 15 artists, including Tammy Wynette and RuPaul. This included a new collaboration with Kiki Dee, \"True Love\", which \n\n the Top 10 of the UK charts. In the same year, The Bunbury Tails, a multi-artist charity album, was released, which was the soundtrack to the British animated television series of the same name. \"Up The Revolution\" was John's track, alongside contributions from George Harrison, the Bee Gees and Eric Clapton. The album was issued briefly, and only in the UK. Along with Tim Rice, John wrote the songs for the 1994 Disney animated film The Lion King. At the 67th Academy Awards, three of the five nominees for the Academy Award for Best Original Song were from The Lion King soundtrack. John \n\n title track is an autobiographical recounting of parts of his life. The album also featured the single \"Believe\". John performed \"Believe\" at the 1995 Brit Awards and won the Outstanding Contribution to Music prize. A duet with Luciano Pavarotti, \"Live Like Horses\", reached number nine in the UK in December 1996. A compilation album, Love Songs, was released in 1996. Early in 1997, John held a 50th birthday party, costumed as Louis XIV of France, with 500 friends. He performed with the surviving members of Queen in Paris at the opening night (17 January 1997) of Le Presbytère N'a Rien Perdu De Son \n\n 8 album The One, featuring the hit song \"The One\". It was his first album recorded entirely sober. As John recalled in 2020, \"I was used to making records under the haze of alcohol or drugs, and here I was, 100% sober, so it was tough. But I managed to come up with a good song, which was the title of the record.\" He also released \"Runaway Train\", a duet he recorded with his longtime friend Eric Clapton, with whom he played on Clapton's World Tour. John and Taupin then signed a music publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music for an estimated $39 million \n\n In 1990, John achieved his first solo UK number one hit single, with \"Sacrifice\" (coupled with \"Healing Hands\") from the previous year's album Sleeping with the Past; it stayed at the top spot for five weeks. The following year, \"Basque\" won the Grammy for Best Instrumental, and a guest concert appearance at Wembley Arena John made on George Michael's cover of \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" was released as a single and topped the charts in both the UK and the US.

Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter \n\n A graphite pencil, also called a lead pencil, is a type of pencil in which a thin graphite core is embedded in a shell of other material. The pencil shell is typically wooden, but can be made of plastic or recycled paper.\n\n A large deposit of graphite was discovered in 1565 on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called plumbago (Latin for \"lead ore\"). Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or a \"lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, even though it never contained the element lead. The words for pencil in German (Bleistift), Irish (peann luaidhe), Arabic (قلم رصاص qalam raṣāṣ), and some other languages \n\n The ability to leave marks on paper and other objects gave graphite its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. It stems from γράφειν (\"graphein\"), meaning to write or draw in Ancient Greek. From the 16th century, all pencils were made with leads of English natural graphite, but modern pencil lead is most commonly a mix of powdered graphite and clay; it was invented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. It is chemically unrelated to the metal lead, whose ores had a similar appearance, hence the continuation of the name. Plumbago is another older term for natural graphite used for drawing, typically as a lump of the mineral without a wood casing. The term plumbago drawing is normally restricted to 17th and 18th-century works, mostly portraits. Today, pencils are still a small but significant market for natural graphite. Around 7% of the 1.1 million tonnes produced in 2011 was used to make pencils. Low-quality amorphous graphite is used and sourced mainly from China.\n\n mean lead pen. The value of graphite would soon be realised to be enormous, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs; the mines were taken over by the Crown and were guarded. When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. England would enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found in 1662 in Italy. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, still manufactures pencils, the factory also being the location of the Cumberland Pencil Museum.\n\nQuestion: when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The members of an autosome pair in a diploid cell have the same morphology, unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structures. The DNA in autosomes is collectively known as atDNA or auDNA. For example, humans have a diploid genome that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters. By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two X chromosomes \n\n  The DNA of an individual is the same in every somatic (nonreproductive) cell. Sexual reproduction brings the DNA of both parents together to create a unique combination of genetic material in a new cell, so the genetic material of an individual is derived from the genetic material of each parent in equal amounts; this genetic material is known as the nuclear genome of the individual, because it is found in the nucleus. Comparing the DNA sequence of one person to that of another can prove if one of them was derived from the other, but DNA paternity tests are not currently 100% accurate. Specific sequences are examined to see if they were copied verbatim from one individual's genome; if so, then the genetic material of one individual \n\n  Environmental DNA or eDNA is DNA that is collected from a variety of environmental samples such as soil, seawater, snow or even air rather than directly sampled from an individual organism. As various organisms interact with the environment, DNA is expelled and accumulates in their surroundings from various sources. Example sources of eDNA include, but are not limited to, feces, mucus, gametes, shed skin, carcasses and hair. Such samples can be analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing methods, known as metagenomics, metabarcoding, and single-species detection, for rapid monitoring and measurement of biodiversity. In order to better differentiate between organisms within a sample, DNA metabarcoding is used in which the sample is analyzed and uses previously studied DNA libraries, such as BLAST, to determine what organisms are present. \n\n**Dolly the sheep** The first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.DNA is found in the cells of all prokaryotes and eukaryotes.**DNA** Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries the coded genetic information that transmits inherited traits.**cytoplasm** The part of a cell that surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by the cell's outer membrane – the cellular membrane.**cell** Smallest unit of an organism, typically but not always consisting of a nucleus and cytoplasm encircled by a membrane. Many microscopic organisms – such as bacteria and yeasts – consist of just one cell. **centrioles** Organelles (compartments within a cell) found in pairs close to the nucleus in animal cells. Centrioles play a key role in cell division. **chloroplast** A plastid (type of organelle) found in the cells of green plants, in which photosynthesis occurs. **choanoflagellates** Free-living single-celled microscopic eukaryotes believed to have been the evolutionary ancestors of animals. They are flagellate – they contain whip-like organelles known as _flagella_. **cloning** Asexual reproduction of genetically identical copies of an original organism or cell. Cloning occurs naturally: plants' and animals' body cells are ultimately clones of an original fertilized egg. Cells are also cloned in the laboratory: for example, the nucleus can be removed from an egg and replaced with the nucleus of a cell of the type to be cloned. **cyanobacteria** Single-celled prokaryotic organisms that derive energy through photosynthesis. Also known as blue-green bacteria, they are the earliest known lifeform on Earth – their fossil record in western Australia dates to 3.5 billion years ago. **cytoplasm** The part of a cell that surrounds the nucleus and is enclosed by the cell's outer membrane – the cellular membrane. **DNA** Deoxyribonucleic acid, a molecule that carries the coded genetic information that transmits inherited traits.

From this information, detection and classification of species is possible. eDNA may come from skin, mucous, saliva, sperm, secretions, eggs, feces, urine, blood, roots, leaves, fruit, pollen, and rotting bodies of larger organisms, while microorganisms may be obtained in their entirety. eDNA production is dependent on biomass, age and feeding activity of the organism as well as physiology, life \n\nQuestion: where can you find dna in the body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the 1960 Games at Squaw Valley, California, defeating the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, and \n\n The United States competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from February 9 to 25, 2018. The United States had its worst showing at a Winter Olympics since the 1998 Nagano Games, ranking out of the top three in both the gold and total medal count with 9 and 23 medals respectively, and finished fourth in both rankings. However, there were some notable successes for the team. Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randall won the first Olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing ever for the United States in the women's team sprint event. Skip John Shuster led his team to the United States' first-ever gold medal in curling, winning the men's curling over Sweden. The United States women's national ice hockey team also won the gold in the women's ice hockey tournament for the first time since the inauguration of the sport in 1998 over the four-time defending gold medalist Canada in an overtime penalty shootout. The United States earned medals in at least one event in 11 different sports, the most of any nation. These Games also witnessed the 100th Winter Olympic gold medal for the Americans, won by Shaun White.\n\n Men's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1920. The men's tournament was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and permanently added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. The United States has participated in 22 of 23 tournaments, sending 43 goaltenders and 282 skaters. For the first two tournaments, the United States sent club amateur teams with additional players from other squads. After sitting out the 1928 tournament, they returned in 1932 with a team made up almost entirely of players attending college in the US. The early American teams were successful, winning three silver medals and a bronze in the first five tournaments. In 1948, controversy struck when the \n\n Quaglia played for the France men's national ice hockey team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, and the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. He won a silver medal at the 1923 European Championship and was also the tournament's top scorer, finishing with 10 goals. At the 1924 European Championship, he won a gold medal with France and scored the game-winning goal against Sweden in the final. At the club level, he won the French Championship with Chamonix Hockey Club in 1923 and 1930. In 1925 he won the Italian Championship with Hockey Club Milano. He was inducted into the French Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in 2010. Quaglia also competed as a speed skater at the Winter Olympics in 1924 and 1928, with the best result of sixth place all-around in 1924. The Trophée Léon Quaglia, a short-track speed skating event, is held annually in Chamonix in his honour.\n\n Updated on November 1, 2018 ''This table includes two medals – one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.

It is an adaptation of Paul Abbott's British series of the same name and features an ensemble cast led by William H. Macy and Emmy Rossum. The show is set on the South Side of Chicago. With the premiere of the ninth season on September 9, 2018, Shameless became the longest-running original scripted series in Showtime's history. In January 2019, the series was renewed for a tenth season, which premiered on November 10, 2019. In January 2020, the series was renewed for its eleventh and final season, which was scheduled to premiere in mid-2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it instead premiered on December 6, 2020. On December 14, 2020, Showtime announced that they are airing a clip show series during Season 11, Shameless: Hall of Shame, containing new scenes juxtaposed with clips from the show to summarize the characters' journeys during the prior 10 seasons.\n\n The Last Kingdom is a British historical fiction television series based on Bernard Cornwell's The Saxon Stories series of novels. The first season debuted on BBC America on 10 October 2015, and BBC Two on 22 October 2015. The second season premiered on 16 March 2017 and was a joint venture between the BBC and Netflix. Netflix bought the rights exclusively for the third season, which was released on 19 November 2018. This was followed by a fourth season, which was released on 26 April 2020.

This enzyme plays a crucial role in regulating the overall rate of glucose metabolism in the glycolytic pathway. Phosphofructokinase catalyzes the third step of glycolysis, in which fructose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This conversion is an irreversible and highly regulated step.\n\nPhosphofructokinase is subject to allosteric regulation, whereby certain molecules can bind to its regulatory sites and affect its activity. One of the most important regulatory molecules is ATP, which acts as a negative allosteric effector of PFK. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis.\n\nOverall, phosphofructokinase acts as a molecular \"switch\" that responds to the energy needs of the cell by modulating the rate of glucose metabolism. Its regulation ensures that glycolysis is tightly controlled and can adapt to the energy demands of the cell.\n\n In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.\n\nThe enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in glycolysis is phosphofructokinase (PFK). PFK plays a crucial role in regulating the glycolytic pathway by catalyzing the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway.\n\nPFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. One of the key regulators of PFK is ATP, which acts as a negative allosteric effector, inhibiting PFK activity when cellular energy levels are high. Other factors, such as citrate and low pH, can also inhibit PFK activity.\n\nOn the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP.\n\nOverall, the regulation of PFK activity ensures a fine-tuned control of glycolysis, allowing cells to respond to fluctuations in energy demands. Its crucial role in the first committed step of glycolysis highlights its significance as a key enzyme in energy metabolism.\n\nThe allosteric inhibitor of PFK-1 is AMP/ADP. PFK-1, or phosphofructokinase-1, is an enzyme involved in the regulation of glycolysis, a critical metabolic pathway. Allosteric regulation refers to the binding of molecules to a site other than the active site of an enzyme, which can modulate its activity. In the case of PFK-1, AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and ADP (adenosine diphosphate) act as allosteric inhibitors. When AMP or ADP levels are high, they bind to specific sites on PFK-1, inhibiting its activity and slowing down glycolysis. This mechanism ensures that glycolysis is regulated according to the energy needs of the cell.\n\nA classical example of allosteric inhibition in biochemistry involves the regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) through the binding of citrate and ATP. Allosteric inhibition refers to the process in which the activity of an enzyme is regulated by the binding of a molecule to a specific site other than the active site. In the case of PFK-1, both citrate and ATP act as allosteric inhibitors, meaning they bind to the enzyme at different sites, leading to a decrease in its activity.\n\nCitrate, which is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, serves as an important regulator of glycolysis. When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis.\n\nAdditionally, ATP, which is an energy carrier molecule, can also act as an allosteric inhibitor of PFK-1. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required.\n\nBy binding to specific allosteric sites on PFK-1, both citrate and ATP play crucial roles in regulating the enzyme's activity and maintaining metabolic balance. This classical example of allosteric inhibition demonstrates the intricate control mechanisms that exist in biochemistry to ensure efficient cellular function.\n\nQuestion: which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party. Since the 1860s, its main political rival has been the Republican Party. Before 1860, the Democratic Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs. It split in two in 1860 over slavery and won the presidency only twice between 1860 and 1910. In the late 19th century, it continued to oppose high tariffs and had bitter internal debates on the gold standard. In the early 20th century, it supported progressive reforms and opposed imperialism, with \n\n The Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or Democratic-Republican Party organized by Jefferson and Madison in opposition to the Federalist Party. The Democratic-Republican Party favored republicanism; a weak federal government; states' rights; agrarian interests (especially Southern planters); and strict adherence to the Constitution. The party opposed a national bank and Great Britain. After the War of 1812, the Federalists virtually disappeared and the only national political party left was the Democratic-Republicans, which was prone to splinter along regional lines. The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the Era of Good Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president. Jackson and Martin Van Buren worked with allies in each state to form a new Democratic Party on a national basis. In the 1830s, the Whig Party coalesced into the main rival to the Democrats.\n\n The title of \"Democrat\" has its beginnings in the South, going back to the founding of the Democratic-Republican Party in 1793 by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It held to small government principles and distrusted the national government. Foreign policy was a major issue. After being the dominant party in U.S. politics from 1800 to 1829, the Democratic-Republicans split into two factions by 1828: the federalist National Republicans, and the Democrats. The Democrats and Whigs were evenly balanced in the 1830s and 1840s. However, by the 1850s, the Whigs disintegrated. Other opposition parties emerged but the Democrats were dominant. Northern Democrats were in serious opposition to Southern Democrats on the issue of slavery; Northern Democrats, led by Stephen Douglas, believed in Popular Sovereignty—letting the people \n\n The Democratic-Republican Party splintered in 1824 into the short-lived National Republican Party and the Jacksonian movement which in 1828 became the Democratic Party. Under the Jacksonian era, the term \"The Democracy\" was in use by the party, but the name \"Democratic Party\" was eventually settled upon and became the official name in 1844. Members of the party are called \"Democrats\" or \"Dems\". The term \"Democrat Party\" has also been in local use but has usually been used by opponents since 1952 as a disparaging term. The most common mascot symbol for the party has been the donkey, or jackass. Andrew Jackson's enemies twisted his name to \"jackass\" as a term of ridicule regarding a \n\n The Democratic-Republican Party split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe. The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the modern Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828: \"Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president.

It opens with the \"volcanic\" ballad \"Moments\", which boasts atmospherics and influences of \"trippy\" samba. Lyrically, it sees Lo confessing her flaws before declaring \"On good days, I am charming as fuck!\". \"The Way That I Am\" is a dubstep song filled with \"pain and passion\" as Lo sings in a soulful rasp and lyrically cries out to her partner to love her as she is; including flaws. \"Got Love\" is one of the albums \"pure\" pop moments, and contains an unwaveringly positive attitude. Lyrically, she rejoices exultant feelings of first falling in love as she sings \"Good enough \n\n The song is a mid-tempo tune whose singer recalls being sent home one day from school for fighting when he was a child, and he tells his father what had happened, expecting punishment from his father. Instead his father tells him that fathers always love their children, and that such love is a \"love without end, Amen.\" In the second verse, the singer has now become a father, and he had no doubt that his son was \"just like (his) father's son\", and he passes his father's secret on to his son. In the third and final verse, the singer dreams that he has died and is standing outside the gates of Heaven.

Country artist Anne Murray (who'd taken her recording of another Loggins & Messina recording, \"Danny's Song\", to the top-ten in late 1972) covered the song later that year for her album of the same name. Released in December 1973, Murray's version became a major crossover hit early in 1974. In her native Canada, it topped all three singles charts: the overall Top Singles chart, the Country Tracks chart and the Adult Contemporary chart.

Lyrically, it acknowledges that any relationship has occasional annoyances, but these aren't enough to prompt Mraz to give up on it. Mraz further explained the track, in a \"track-by-track\" commentary for Billboard: \"I try to keep my music gender neutral, but this is obvious, it's called 'The Woman I Love,' but I'd like to dedicate to the men in the relationships because every so often the woman forgets her own greatness and she goes a little bat sh-- crazy sometimes.

After he narrated the story to Marion Cotillard, she agreed to play Marie, a character loosely based on Lancaster's real-life lover, Chubbie Miller. The Last Flight was originally scheduled to begin shooting in Niger, but due to safety concerns it was filmed in and around the Moroccan village of Merzouga. Due to the location change, Tuareg actors had to be brought in from Mali. For his role in the film as a French lieutenant who has assimilated to Tuareg culture, Guillaume Canet learned Tamasheq, the Tuareg language.\n\nQuestion: where was the original flight of the phoenix filmed\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The character was seen by many readers as a ground-breaking humanistic portrayal of a slave, one who uses nonresistance and gives his life to protect others who have escaped from slavery. However, the character also came to be seen, especially based on his portrayal in pro-compassion dramatizations, as inexplicably kind to white slaveholders. This led to the use of Uncle Tom – sometimes shortened to just a Tom – as a derogatory epithet for an exceedingly subservient person or house negro, particularly one aware of their own lower-class racial status.\n\n Antifanaticism is one of several examples of the plantation literature genre that appeared in reaction to the anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which had been criticised as inaccurately depicting slaveholders and slavery in general. Authors from the Southern United States sought to rectify this through their own series of pro-slavery novels. Examples of these include: Aunt Phillis's Cabin (1852), Uncle Robin, in His Cabin in Virginia, and Tom Without One in Boston (1853) and The Planter's Northern Bride (1854). Butt explains in her novel that Antifanaticism is her first novel, and invites Stowe herself to the south to see that the events of the book, though fictional, are based on reality rather than fiction, which she accuses Stowe of doing in the creation of Uncle Tom's Cabin.\n\n Uncle Tom's Children is a collection of novellas and the first book published by African-American author Richard Wright, who went on to write Native Son (1940), Black Boy (1945), and The Outsider (1953). When it was first published in 1938, Uncle Tom's Children included only four novellas: \"Big Boy Leaves Home,\" \"Down by the Riverside,\" \"Long Black Song,\" and \"Fire and Cloud.\" \"The Ethics of Living Jim Crow\" and \"Bright and Morning Star,\" which are now the first and final pieces, respectively, were added when the book was republished in 1940. The book's title is derived from Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, an anti-slavery novel published in 1852.\n\n Harriet Beecher Stowe published the anti-slavery novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin, in 1852. During the first year of being published, over one million copies were sold in Great Britain and the United States, which led it to become the best selling novel of the 19th-century. Stowe had the intentions of this novel being published when she wrote it; she had taken out a copyright for Uncle Tom's Cabin before it appeared in The National Era. Stowe knew in order for her novel to play a pivotal role in the development of American culture; focusing on racism, slavery, and gender, she had to make a larger impact than the abolitionists of the press. Established by a Russian journalist, Stowe used \"defamiliarization\" to create new perspectives when it came to the issues she focused on, by presenting them in unfamiliar ways so people can see it in a different way. This helped support her endorsing domestic family values of all races, and presented the prejudicial assumption options about cultural differences in the 19th-century.\n\n A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin is a book by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published to document the veracity of the depiction of slavery in Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). First published in 1853 by Jewett, Proctor & Worthington, the book also provides insights into Stowe's own views on slavery.\n\nQuestion: where was uncle tom 's cabin first published\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A week later Hamilton won the, becoming the first Briton since John Watson in 1983 to win a Formula One race in the US. Hamilton finished third at Magny-Cours behind Kimi Räikkönen and Felipe Massa, to extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 14 points. In his first home Grand Prix at Silverstone, Hamilton finished third to equal Jim Clark's record of 9 consecutive podium finishes for a British driver. This run came to an end at the where during qualifying, Hamilton crashed at the Schumacher chicane after a problem with a wheel nut.

Button ultimately finished a tenth of a second behind Hamilton, locking out the front row of the grid; the result was the first time since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix that two British drivers occupied the front row of the grid, and the first time since the 2010 Italian Grand Prix in which a Red Bull car failed to qualify on the front row of the grid. Schumacher's second flying lap was set on fresh rubber, and while he initially looked set to take third place, he had to settle for fourth after a surprise lap from \n\n from Hamilton, to become the first driver to win three consecutive Grands Prix since Button won four races in succession in May and June. Alonso rapidly caught Petrov, but Petrov held on long enough to secure third place, the only podium finish of his career. With Alonso fourth, Mark Webber equalled his best result at Albert Park, finishing fifth. Jenson Button finished sixth ahead of the Saubers of Sergio Pérez in seventh and Kamui Kobayashi in eighth, while Felipe Massa crossed the line ninth, almost ninety seconds behind Vettel. Sébastien Buemi claimed the final championship point in tenth, one lap down.\n\n On 11 November 2013, Bottas was confirmed to continue with Williams-Mercedes in 2014 alongside Felipe Massa, who was signed from Ferrari to replace Pastor Maldonado. At the first race of the 2014 season in Australia, Bottas qualified 10th and finished 6th, after recovering from a crash earlier in the race. He was later promoted to 5th after Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from 2nd position. At the, Bottas qualified 2nd, his then-best grid position in Formula One and achieved his first podium in the sport, finishing third behind Nico Rosberg (1st) and Lewis Hamilton (2nd). Despite qualifying 14th on the grid at the, Bottas charged through the field to finish second, following Rosberg's retirement from the race, thereby achieving his second consecutive career podium. At the, he qualified second and ended the race in the same position despite a late challenge from Hamilton. After achieving three more podiums in Belgium, Russia (where he set his first fastest lap of a race) and Abu Dhabi (part of the Williams team's first double podium since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix), Bottas finished 4th overall in the Drivers' Championship, beating the likes of former world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso.\n\n Ferrari dominated the opening weekend at Albert Park in Australia, comfortably locking out the front row in qualifying and earning a 1–2 in the race. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race on his way to a lights-to-flag victory, with teammate Rubens Barrichello and Renault's Fernando Alonso joining him on the podium. Schumacher followed that up with another pole and victory at Sepang, finishing ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya and Jenson Button, the British driver scoring his first career podium and the BAR Honda team's best result since the 2001 German Grand Prix. Mark Webber, who split the Ferraris in qualifying in his unfancied Jaguar, suffered a poor start before colliding with Ralf Schumacher and spinning out. Formula One's first visit to the Arab world since the 1958 Moroccan Grand Prix took place at the Bahrain International Circuit. The Ferrari duo of Schumacher and Barrichello once again finished 1–2 in both qualifying and the race, with Button's second consecutive podium elevating him to third in the Drivers' Championship as the series headed for Europe.\n\nQuestion: who has the most podium finishes in australia\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The city of St. Augustine, in current-day Florida, founded in 1565 by the Spanish, is credited as the oldest continuously-inhabited European-established settlement in the contiguous United States. By the 1530s, the British and French had begun colonizing the northeast tip of the Americas. Within a century, the Swedish had established New Sweden, the Dutch had established New Netherland, and Denmark–Norway along with the other aforementioned powers had made several claims in the Caribbean, and by the 1700s, Denmark–Norway had revived its former colonies in Greenland, and Russia had begun to explore and claim the Pacific \n\n While some Norse colonies were established in north eastern North America as early as the 10th century, systematic European colonization began in 1492. A Spanish expedition which was headed by the Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus sailed west in order to find a new trade route to the Far East, the source of spices, silks, porcelains, and other rich trade goods. The overland Silk Road did not benefit Iberia and the Portuguese who left Spain in order to conduct voyages down the coast of Africa because they needed to find an alternative route. Columbus inadvertently landed in what Europeans would later call the \n\n Giovanni da Verrazzano landed in North Carolina in 1524, and was the first European to sail into New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay. A decade later, Jacques Cartier sailed in search of the Northwest Passage, but instead discovered the Saint Lawrence River and laid the foundation for French colonization of the Americas in New France. After the collapse of the first Quebec colony in the 1540s, French Huguenots settled at Fort Caroline near present-day Jacksonville in Florida. In 1565, Spanish forces led by Pedro Menéndez destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States — St. Augustine. After this, the French mostly remained in Quebec and Acadia, but far-reaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling New Orleans, Mobile and Biloxi.\n\n other powers such as the Netherlands and Sweden also received holdings on the continent. Settlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas. They gained control of most of the largest islands in the Caribbean and conquered the Aztec empire, gaining control of present-day Mexico and Central America. This was the beginning of the Spanish Empire in the New World. The first successful Spanish settlement in continental North America was Veracruz founded by Hernán Cortés in 1519, followed by many other settlements in colonial New Spain, including Spanish Florida, Central America, New Mexico, and later California. The Spanish claimed all of North and South America (with the exception of Brazil), and \n\n In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas, after which European exploration and colonization rapidly expanding. The post-1492 era is known as the Columbian Exchange period. The first conquests were made by the Spanish, who quickly conquered most of South and Central America and large parts of North America. The Portuguese took Brazil. The British, French and Dutch conquered islands in the Caribbean Sea, many of which had already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease. Early European colonies in North America included Spanish Florida, the British settlements in Virginia and New England, French settlements in Quebec and Louisiana, and Dutch settlements in New Netherlands.

After his death in 1303, he was succeeded by his son Pratapbimba, who had built his capital city at Marol in Salsette, which he named Pratappur. The islands were wrested from Pratapbimba's control by Mubarak, the emperor of Delhi, who had occupied Mahim and Salsette under his expansion campaign in 1318. But it was later reconquered by Pratapbimba, which he ruled till 1331. Later, his brother-in-law Nagardev reigned for 17 years till 1348. In 1348, the islands came under the control of the Muzaffarid dynasty of Gujarat, thus ending the sovereignty of Hindu rulers over the islands of Bombay.\n\n The present day Mumbai was originally an archipelago of seven islands. Pleistocene sediments found around Kandivali on Salsette Island north of the seven islands by Todd in 1939 indicate that these islands were inhabited since the Stone Age. The archipelago had been named after the Koli Goddess Mumbadevi. The port of Sopara (present day Nala Sopara near Mumbai) was an important trading centre during ancient times. In the 3rd century BCE, the islands were incorporated into the Maurya Empire under the expansion campaign of Emperor Ashoka of Magadha. The empire's patronage gradually made the islands a centre of Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture.

Found in all known forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the \"molecular unit of currency\" of intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme. From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate.\n\n A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.\n\n Oxidative phosphorylation is the process driving ATP synthesis by means of the energy of O2 released through the oxidation of reducing equivalents. It occurs in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of transmembrane protein complexes that catalyze redox reactions. NADH and FADH2 are reducing equivalents that donate electrons at complexes I and II, respectively. These electrons are then transferred in multiple redox reactions and are carried to the complexes III and IV. The oxidation of reducing equivalents in the electron transport chain releases protons into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria and maintains the proton electrochemical gradient. As protons move down the electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane protein ATP synthase, ATP is generated from ADP and an inorganic phosphate group. In order to maintain the proton gradient and generate ATP, reducing equivalents are supplied to the electron transport chain from multiple processes such as the TCA cycle.\n\nSome examples of metabolic pathways involved in ATP production include glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is the initial step in glucose metabolism and occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. It involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP. \n\nThe pyruvate produced from glycolysis then enters the mitochondria where it undergoes further processing in the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as NADH and FADH2, which are then used in oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nOxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is the main pathway for ATP production. It involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain (ETC). As electrons pass through the ETC, energy is released and used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This creates an electrochemical gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP by the enzyme ATP synthase.\n\nThese metabolic pathways work in concert to efficiently produce ATP, the primary energy currency of cells.\n\n In plants, ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. The process is called photophosphorylation. The \"machinery\" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars.\n\nQuestion: where does the formation of atp take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On 8 March 1995, he was consecrated as bishop by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, as Suffragan Bishop in Europe. He was also commissioned by Edmond Browning as an assistant bishop to the Convocation of American Churches in Europe in May 1995. From 2002 to 2008, Scriven served the Diocese of Pittsburgh as assistant bishop. He is married to Catherine and has a daughter, Anna, and a son, Joel. Scriven is great-great-grandnephew of Joseph Scriven, Irish poet, best known as the writer of the poem which became the hymn \"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\".\n\n Cruttenden became a friend of Methodist George Whitefield in 1742, after hearing John Cennick preach at the recently built wooden Tabernacle. He rejoined the Calvinistic Lime Street Independent chapel, near Leadenhall Market, where Robert Bragge had been pastor; becoming a lay elder. Here he experienced a spiritual conversion, which was described in print by Whitefield, attracting interest and criticism. Cruttenden wrote seven or so hymns, published after his death: 'And is it yet, dear Lord, a doubt?' 'Did Jesus die, but not for me?’ ‘I own my guilt, my sins confess;' 'Let others boast their ancient line;' 'Rise, Sun of glory, shine reveal'd;' ' 'Tis false, thou vile accuser, go;' 'What adverse powers we feel within.'\n\n \"What a Friend\" is a song performed by Canadian contemporary Christian music (CCM) artist Matt Maher. The song was released as the second single from his 2017 album Echoes on September 15, 2017. The song peaked at No. 10 on the US Hot Christian Songs chart, becoming his seventh Top 10 single from that chart. It lasted 26 weeks on the overall chart. The song is played in an E major key, and 110 beats per minute.\n\n \"What a Friend\" was released on September 15, 2017, as the second single from his fifth studio album Echoes. The song samples the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus by Joseph M. Scriven, who wrote it in 1855 to comfort his mother in Iceland while he was living in Canada. Maher shows God’s faithfulness even in the midst of personal sorrow and devastation. On the song, Maher sings about the joy of our friendship with the Saviour. Aleteia described the song as \"switching gears from quiet worship to bouncing folk-rock, with a country-pop hook, where the piece is infused with a jubilant energy, which is aided by a perfectly employed gospel-ish choir.\"\n\n Although the lyrics were originally composed, the music and melody of this adaptation resembled the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus, originally written by Joseph M. Scriven as a poem in 1855. The hymn is sung in Indonesian as Yesus Kawan yang Sejati and in Toba Batak as Ise do Alealenta and is popular in Batak churches, as well as in Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. Even though Indonesia has a statistically larger Muslim community, the hymn is quite widely known. Prior his death in 1958, the melody of the music was adopted by Kamsidi Samsuddin, the composer of the Ibu Pertiwi song.\n\nQuestion: who wrote song what a friend we have in jesus\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly gave it a great review: \"\"The Jolly Roger\" was an appropriately exciting hour of television—complete with the sort of confounding, frustrating final twist that Once should consider having trademarked. All that, plus the return of JoAnna Garcia Swisher's delightfully daffy Ariel? Christine Orlado of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.4 out of 5 stars. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave it an 8.5, saying that \"This week's Once focused on Hook, and things got awfully exciting - in a good way.\" Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, noting that \"Hook has been one of the more delightful character reinventions on Once Upon A Time. Turning the classic permed villain into a swaggery anti-hero, now a tortured romantic, is one of the most successful character transformations this show has taken on. The episode title “The Jolly Roger” refers to Hook’s efforts to get his boat back, his true love, but really the vessel is just a stand-in for his actual true love, Emma, who—due to yet another unfortunate curse!—seems farther away from him than ever by the end of the episode.\"\n\n With Emma having become the new Dark One, her family travels to Camelot to find the sorcerer Merlin, in a bid to remove the darkness from her vessel. The heroes then met King Arthur and Queen Guinevere of Camelot, with both on the hunt of the Dark One's dagger to make Excalibur whole. The trip to Camelot is cut short when another Dark Curse is cast, returning everyone to Storybrooke, where it is revealed that Hook had also become a Dark One and is responsible for the new curse. The battle to destroy the darkness leads to the death of Hook, prompting Emma and the heroes to take a trip to the Underworld where Hades, as well as most of the deceased villains have plans of their own to get back to the land of the living. Hook is eventually resurrected, but a bid from Mr. Gold to capture all of Storybrooke's magic resulted in the arrival of Mr. Hyde and refugees from the Land of Untold Stories to Storybrooke, as well as the separation of Regina Mills and her evil self, who wages war on Regina.\n\n turns out that Blackbeard has left Eric stranded on a deserted island, and offers Hook a deal in which he'll tell him where Eric is if Hook gives up the Jolly Roger, or else Eric will die. Ariel tries to talk Hook into saving Eric and giving up the Jolly Roger, but he tells her love brings pain and that he's doing her a favour. As Hook cuts Blackbeard loose and tosses him overboard, Ariel slaps Hook and tells him he's selfish and heartless, and that's what will bring him endless torment. Then she jumps off the plank into the water to find Eric, changing back into a mermaid as she swims off.\n\n As Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), Snow White/Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Aurora (Sarah Bolger) return to the island from the castle, the foursome discover that everyone at the camp has been killed and their hearts ripped out by Cora. However, they discover Captain Hook/Killian Jones (Colin O'Donoghue) hiding among the bodies. Hook claims that he was the only survivor and pretends to act like a traumatized victim in an effort to gain their trust. However, Emma is suspicious of his claim, and is convinced that he is lying about the attack. She ties him to a tree and threatens to leave him to the ogres if he does not confess; Hook finally comes clean and reveals \n\nThis episode was the intended final appearance for Jennifer Morrison, who decided to leave the series at the conclusion of the sixth season. Morrison agreed to return for one final episode in order to give fans a final chance to see what happened to Emma and to give her character a proper closure. In March 2018 it was revealed Morrison would reprise the role for the series finale. ; The episode revealed a twist in Colin O'Donoghue's character, which revealed that the Killian Jones that was cursed as Rogers in Hyperion Heights was not the one from Storybrooke and the Enchanted Forest. O'Donoghue knew about the surprise twist when production began as he kept hinting that there was a reason why they wanted to make sure that Emma and Hook had a happy ending. \n\nQuestion: who dies in season 6 of once upon a time\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Pullum used a newspaper photograph of actor Eddie Murphy to alter an identification badge he used in the escape. The attempt made Pullum the 13th person to successfully escape the facility. In May 2013, along with the adjacent Men's Central Jail, Twin Towers ranked as one of the ten worst prisons in the United States, based on reporting in Mother Jones magazine which stated: \"Packed at the best of times, Twin Towers and Men's Central are overflowing with prisoners transferred there from overcrowded California prisons under the state's court-ordered reorganization scheme.

For his unauthorized feat 1,312 ft above the ground, he rigged a 440 lb cable and used a custom-made 30 ft, 55 lb balancing pole. He performed for 45 minutes, making eight passes along the wire. Though Petit was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct, he was later freed in exchange for performing for children in Central Park. On February 20, 1981, an Aerolíneas Argentinas airliner was guided away by air traffic controllers after radar signals indicated it was on a collision course with the North Tower (1 WTC). The aircraft, which departed from José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and was scheduled to land at nearby JFK Airport, was flying at a much lower altitude than regulations recommended. The 1995 PCA world chess championship was played on the 107th floor of the South Tower.\n\n  Before its destruction, the World Trade Center was a New York City icon, and the Twin Towers were the centerpiece that represented the entire complex. They were used in film and TV projects as \"establishing shots\", standing for New York City as a whole. In 1999, one writer noted: \"Nearly every guidebook in New York City lists the Twin Towers among the city's top ten attractions.\" There were several high-profile events that occurred at the World Trade Center. The most notable was held at the original WTC in 1974.

The film chronicles Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center. It is based on Petit's 2002 book, To Reach the Clouds, released in paperback with the title Man on Wire. The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest (and later release) of Petit, whose performance lasted for almost an hour. The film is crafted like a heist film, presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments (with Paul McGill as the young Petit) and present-day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man. Man on Wire competed in the World Cinema Documentary Competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize: World Cinema Documentary and the World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary.

In the United States, copyright will not expire until 95 years after publication for each of Milne's books first published before 1978, but this includes the illustrations. In 2008, a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than £1.2 million at auction in Sotheby's, London. Forbes magazine ranked Winnie the Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002; Winnie the Pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than $5.9 billion. In 2005, Winnie the Pooh generated $6 billion, a figure surpassed by only Mickey Mouse. \n\n Winnie the Pooh, the fictional teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne, is one of the most popular characters adapted for film and television by The Walt Disney Company. Disney first received certain licensing rights to the Winnie the Pooh stories, characters, and trademarks from Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and the estate of A. A. Milne in 1961.\n\n Sometime around 2000, the Pooh Properties Trust licensed additional rights to Disney and accepted a buyout of their claims to royalties as defined in a 1991 lawsuit brought by Stephen Slesinger, Inc. Although Slesinger's rights are arguably more valuable, the combined value paid by Disney to The Pooh Properties Trust is said to be approximately $300 million for Milne's portion of those rights. To further minimize Disney's legal exposure to Slesinger, Disney paid money to the Pooh Properties attorneys and trusts to use the name of Clare Milne, daughter of Christopher Robin, in an attempt to terminate certain of the copyright rights \n\n After Disney purchased the rights for Winnie the Pooh to make a 1966 animated short film, the company conceded to a broad licensing agreement with Sears, Roebuck & Co.. Stephen Slesinger Inc.'s Pati Slesinger found merchandise that Disney did not pay royalties on. Slesinger then attempted to get the A.A. Milne Trust to abrogate its contract. In 1983, Disney paid Stephen Slesinger Inc. and the Milne estate to end the royalty issue and agreed to a new contract that lowered Slesinger Inc.'s royalty percentage. In 1979, the Intergovernmental Philatelic Corporation of New York was licensed by Walt Disney Productions to make Disney character stamps for several countries.\n\n In 2001, the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $350m. Previously Disney had been paying twice-yearly royalties to these beneficiaries. The estate of E. H. Shepard also received a sum in the deal. The UK copyright on the text of the original Winnie the Pooh books expires on 1 January 2027; at the beginning of the year after the 70th anniversary of the author's death (PMA-70), and has already expired in those countries with a PMA-50 rule. This applies to all of Milne's works except those first published posthumously. The illustrations in the Pooh books will remain under copyright until the same amount \n\nQuestion: where do the royalties for winnie the pooh go\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.\n\nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Individual twitches can become indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.\n\nDevelopment \nMotor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. In the neural tube cells are specified to either the rostral-caudal axis or ventral-dorsal axis. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain (pMN). Transcription factors here include Pax6, OLIG2, Nkx-6.1, and Nkx-6.2, which are regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh). The OLIG2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression, a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development.\n\nFurther specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors. There are 13 Hox transcription factors and along with the signals, determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character. In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns.\n\nAnatomy and physiology\n\nUpper motor neurons \n\nUpper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract. Corticomotorneurons project from the primary cortex directly onto motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. They are unique to primates and it has been suggested that their function is the adaptive control of the hands including the relatively independent control of individual fingers. Corticomotorneurons have so far only been found in the primary motor cortex and not in secondary motor areas.\n\nNerve tracts \n\nNerve tracts are bundles of axons as white matter, that carry action potentials to their effectors. In the spinal cord these descending tracts carry impulses from different regions. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. There are seven major descending motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord:\n Lateral corticospinal tract\n Rubrospinal tract\n Lateral reticulospinal tract\n Vestibulospinal tract\n Medial reticulospinal tract\n Tectospinal tract\n Anterior corticospinal tract\n\nLower motor neurons \n\nLower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories.\n\nAccording to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:\n Somatic motor neurons\n Special visceral motor neurons\n General visceral motor neurons\n\nSomatic motor neurons \nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.\n Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells. A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. Motor units are split up into 3 categories: Main Article: Motor Unit\nSlow (S) motor units stimulate small muscle fibers, which contract very slowly and provide small amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue, so they are used to sustain muscular contraction, such as keeping the body upright. They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen. They are also called red fibers.\nFast fatiguing (FF) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups, which apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly. They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts of energy, such as jumping or running. They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence don't require oxygen. They are called white fibers.\nFast fatigue-resistant motor units stimulate moderate-sized muscles groups that don't react as fast as the FF motor units, but can be sustained much longer (as implied by the name) and provide more force than S motor units. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy.\nIn addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. This process is also called the stretch reflex.\n Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles, with collaterals to extrafusal fibres. There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers.  Fast Contracting- These innervate intrafusal fibers.\nGamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. There are two types of gamma motor neurons:   Dynamic- These focus on Bag1 fibers and enhance dynamic sensitivity.  Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity.\n Regulatory factors of lower motor neurons   \nSize Principle – this relates to the soma of the motor neuron. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. By reducing unnecessary muscle fiber recruitment, the body is able to optimize energy consumption.\n Persistent Inward Current (PIC) – recent animal study research has shown that constant flow of ions such as calcium and sodium through channels in the soma and dendrites influence the synaptic input. An alternate way to think of this is that the post-synaptic neuron is being primed before receiving an impulse.  \n After Hyper-polarization (AHP) – A trend has been identified that shows slow motor neurons to have more intense AHPs for a longer duration. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate.\n\nSpecial visceral motor neurons \nThese are also known as branchial motor neurons, which are involved in facial expression, mastication, phonation, and swallowing. Associated cranial nerves are the oculomotor, abducens, trochlear, and hypoglossal nerves.\n\nGeneral visceral motor neurons \nThese motor neurons indirectly innervate cardiac muscle and smooth muscles of the viscera ( the muscles of the arteries): they synapse onto neurons located in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic), located in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which themselves directly innervate visceral muscles (and also some gland cells).\n\nIn consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle.  Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle.\n\nAll vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic, whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. (see Table)\n\nNeuromuscular junctions \nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. As a result, if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed, the twitches can superimpose on one another, either through summation or a tetanic contraction. In summation, the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch. The twitches thus superimpose on one another, leading to a force greater than that of a single twitch. A tetanic contraction is caused by constant, very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.\n\nThe interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate. Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound, an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell. The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential. T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is this chemical release that causes the target muscle fiber to contract.\n\nIn invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.  Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself.  This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles (by decreasing their electrophysiological activity) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions, rather than on the muscles themselves.\n\nSee also\n Betz cell\n Central chromatolysis\n Motor dysfunction\n Motor neuron disease\n Nerve\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nEfferent neurons\nMotor system\n\nA motor neuron (or motoneuron or efferent neuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.

The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. The axons of these cells descend from the cortex to form the corticospinal tract. Corticomotorneurons project from the primary cortex directly onto motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. They are unique to primates and it has been suggested that their function is the adaptive control of the hands including the relatively independent control of individual fingers. Corticomotorneurons have so far only been found in the primary motor cortex and not in secondary motor areas.\n\nNerve tracts \n\nNerve tracts are bundles of axons as white matter, that carry action potentials to their effectors. In the spinal cord these descending tracts carry impulses from different regions. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. There are seven major descending motor tracts to be found in the spinal cord:\n Lateral corticospinal tract\n Rubrospinal tract\n Lateral reticulospinal tract\n Vestibulospinal tract\n Medial reticulospinal tract\n Tectospinal tract\n Anterior corticospinal tract\n\nLower motor neurons \n\nLower motor neurons are those that originate in the spinal cord and directly or indirectly innervate effector targets. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories.\n\nAccording to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:\n Somatic motor neurons\n Special visceral motor neurons\n General visceral motor neurons\n\nSomatic motor neurons \nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The three types of these neurons are the alpha efferent neurons, beta efferent neurons, and gamma efferent neurons. They are called efferent to indicate the flow of information from the central nervous system (CNS) to the periphery.\n Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, which are the main force-generating component of a muscle. Their cell bodies are in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and they are sometimes called ventral horn cells. A single motor neuron may synapse with 150 muscle fibers on average. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. Motor units are split up into 3 categories: Main Article: Motor Unit\nSlow (S) motor units stimulate small muscle fibers, which contract very slowly and provide small amounts of energy but are very resistant to fatigue, so they are used to sustain muscular contraction, such as keeping the body upright. They gain their energy via oxidative means and hence require oxygen. They are also called red fibers.\nFast fatiguing (FF) motor units stimulate larger muscle groups, which apply large amounts of force but fatigue very quickly. They are used for tasks that require large brief bursts of energy, such as jumping or running. They gain their energy via glycolytic means and hence don't require oxygen. They are called white fibers.\nFast fatigue-resistant motor units stimulate moderate-sized muscles groups that don't react as fast as the FF motor units, but can be sustained much longer (as implied by the name) and provide more force than S motor units. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy.\nIn addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. This process is also called the stretch reflex.\n Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles, with collaterals to extrafusal fibres. There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers.  Fast Contracting- These innervate intrafusal fibers.\nGamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers found within the muscle spindle. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. There are two types of gamma motor neurons:   Dynamic- These focus on Bag1 fibers and enhance dynamic sensitivity.  Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity.\n Regulatory factors of lower motor neurons   \nSize Principle – this relates to the soma of the motor neuron. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. By reducing unnecessary muscle fiber recruitment, the body is able to optimize energy consumption.\n Persistent Inward Current (PIC) – recent animal study research has shown that constant flow of ions such as calcium and sodium through channels in the soma and dendrites influence the synaptic input. An alternate way to think of this is that the post-synaptic neuron is being primed before receiving an impulse.  \n After Hyper-polarization (AHP) – A trend has been identified that shows slow motor neurons to have more intense AHPs for a longer duration. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate.\n\nSpecial visceral motor neurons \nThese are also known as branchial motor neurons, which are involved in facial expression, mastication, phonation, and swallowing. Associated cranial nerves are the oculomotor, abducens, trochlear, and hypoglossal nerves.\n\nGeneral visceral motor neurons \nThese motor neurons indirectly innervate cardiac muscle and smooth muscles of the viscera ( the muscles of the arteries): they synapse onto neurons located in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic), located in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which themselves directly innervate visceral muscles (and also some gland cells).\n\nIn consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle.  Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle.\n\nAll vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Parasympathetic ganglionic neurons are also cholinergic, whereas most sympathetic ganglionic neurons are noradrenergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. (see Table)\n\nNeuromuscular junctions \nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. As a result, if an action potential arrives before a twitch has completed, the twitches can superimpose on one another, either through summation or a tetanic contraction. In summation, the muscle is stimulated repetitively such that additional action potentials coming from the somatic nervous system arrive before the end of the twitch. The twitches thus superimpose on one another, leading to a force greater than that of a single twitch. A tetanic contraction is caused by constant, very high frequency stimulation - the action potentials come at such a rapid rate that individual twitches are indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.\n\nThe interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. The acetylcholine molecules bind to postsynaptic receptors found within the motor end plate. Once two acetylcholine receptors have been bound, an ion channel is opened and sodium ions are allowed to flow into the cell. The influx of sodium into the cell causes depolarization and triggers a muscle action potential. T tubules of the sarcolemma are then stimulated to elicit calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is this chemical release that causes the target muscle fiber to contract.\n\nIn invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.  Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself.  This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that innervate muscles (by decreasing their electrophysiological activity) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions, rather than on the muscles themselves.\n\nSee also\n Betz cell\n Central chromatolysis\n Motor dysfunction\n Motor neuron disease\n Nerve\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nEfferent neurons\nMotor system\n\nA motor neuron (or motoneuron or efferent neuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.  There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.\n\nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Individual twitches can become indistinguishable, and tension rises smoothly eventually reaching a plateau.\n\nDevelopment \nMotor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. In the neural tube cells are specified to either the rostral-caudal axis or ventral-dorsal axis. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). This homeodomain is known as the motor neural progenitor domain (pMN). Transcription factors here include Pax6, OLIG2, Nkx-6.1, and Nkx-6.2, which are regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh). The OLIG2 gene being the most important due to its role in promoting Ngn2 expression, a gene that causes cell cycle exiting as well as promoting further transcription factors associated with motor neuron development.\n\nFurther specification of motor neurons occurs when retinoic acid, fibroblast growth factor, Wnts, and TGFb, are integrated into the various Hox transcription factors. There are 13 Hox transcription factors and along with the signals, determine whether a motor neuron will be more rostral or caudal in character.

Indeed, a pairing in the late 1990s between Neil Winters and Victoria Newman was axed by CBS executives, who were rumored to have received many angry phone calls and letters by viewers in the South. In 2004, a love affair between Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) and chemist Damon Porter (Keith Hamilton Cobb) was prominently featured, despite concerns that the interracial pairing would be scrapped just like the one that was written before. While the romance between Phyllis and Damon did eventually come to an end, the writers followed up by having Phyllis' son \n\n go in June 2007 and replaced with former Home and Away actress Tammin Sursok, who left in October 2009 after her character died.

Research by the Henley Business School ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015. Arsenal's financial results for the 2019–20 season showed an after tax loss of £47.8m, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Deloitte Football Money League is a publication that homogenises and compares clubs' annual revenue. Deloitte put Arsenal's footballing revenue in 2019 at £392.7m (€445.6m), ranking Arsenal eleventh among world football clubs. Arsenal and Deloitte both listed the match day revenue generated in 2019 by the Emirates Stadium as €109.2m (£96.2m).\n\n In November 2010 the group took over English Premier League football club Blackburn Rovers FC, acquiring a 99.9% stake through a new holding company, Venky's London Ltd. The deal was worth £43 million including taking on around £20 million of the club's debt. After sacking Sam Allardyce as the club's manager, Steve Kean was appointed in his place, raising media concern as Kean's agent Jerome Anderson had advised Venky's during its takeover of the club. Venky's oversaw an unsuccessful period resulting in relegation to the Championship after the 2011–12 Premier League season ending the club's 11-year run in the top flight, then a further relegation to the third-tier EFL League One after the 2016–17 season. Despite Kean leaving Blackburn Rovers in September 2012, criticism of Venky's running of the club has continued, with both fans and the media calling them into question. In September 2016 Venky's publicly stated their commitment to the club.\n\n The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10. In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues. In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry. The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world.

Derby smashed their transfer record twice during the season, signing striker Paul Kitson for £1.3 million from East Midlands rivals Leicester City in March, followed by the signing of striker Tommy Johnson from First Division strugglers Notts County for the same fee. Club legend Bobby Davison was also re-signed, on loan from Leeds United; he scored 8 goals in 10 games to reach a century of goals for the Rams. However, in spite of this flurry of transfer \n\n Vichai was the founder and CEO of King Power Duty Free, an operator of duty-free shops. In December 2009, King Power received the royal warrant from King Bhumibol of Thailand in a ceremony attended by Vichai. In October 2018, he was ranked by Forbes magazine as the 5th richest man in Thailand, reportedly worth US$4.9 billion. The first football match Vichai watched in England was the 1997 League Cup Final between Leicester City and Middlesbrough, which may have attracted him to the club. In August 2010, the Asia Football Investments consortium including Vichai and his son Aiyawatt purchased English Football League Championship club Leicester City. He succeeded Milan Mandarić as chairman of the club in February 2011 while continuing as owner, and Aiyawatt became the vice chairman. In July 2011, the club's formerly named Walkers Stadium was renamed the King Power Stadium. Leicester City went on to win the 2015–16 Premier League title after starting the season as 5000/1 rank outsiders. Shortly before the 2016–17 season, Vichai gifted 19 players a BMW i8—at £100,000 each—as a gift for winning the title.

A DNA polymerase is a member of a family of enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of DNA molecules from nucleoside triphosphates, the molecular precursors of DNA. These enzymes are essential for DNA replication and usually work in groups to create two identical DNA duplexes from a single original DNA duplex. During this process, DNA polymerase \"reads\" the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones. These enzymes catalyze the chemical reaction  DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the three prime (3')-end of a DNA strand, one nucleotide at a time. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerases are required to duplicate the cell's DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. In this way, genetic information is passed down from generation to generation. Before replication can take place, an enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA molecule from its tightly woven form, in the process breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide bases. This opens up or \"unzips\" the double-stranded DNA to give two single strands of DNA that can be used as templates for replication in the above reaction.\n\n Expression of genetic code in all life forms consists of two major processes, synthesis of copies of the genetic code recorded in DNA into the form of mRNA (transcription), and protein synthesis itself (translation), whereby the code copies in mRNA are decoded into amino acid sequences of the respective proteins. Both transcription and translation are highly regulated processes essentially controlling everything of what happens in live cells (and multicellular organisms, consequently). Control of translation is especially important in eukaryotic cells where it forms part of post-transcriptional regulatory networks of genes expression. This additional functionality is reflected in the increased complexity of the translation process, making it a hard object to investigate. Yet details on when and what mRNA is translated and what mechanisms are responsible for this control are key to understanding of normal and pathological cell functionality. TCP-seq can be used to obtain this information.\n\n A codon table can be used to translate a genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. The standard genetic code is traditionally represented as an RNA codon table, because when proteins are made in a cell by ribosomes, it is messenger RNA (mRNA) that directs protein synthesis. The mRNA sequence is determined by the sequence of genomic DNA. In this context, the standard genetic code is referred to as translation table 1. It can also be represented in a DNA codon table. The DNA codons in such tables occur on the sense DNA strand and are arranged in a 5′-to-3′ direction. Different tables \n\nDNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and information transfer in cells through a process called transcription. During transcription, a specific region of DNA, known as a gene, is \"unzipped\" to expose the bases. Ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs), which are building blocks of RNA, attach to the exposed DNA bases in a complementary manner. The enzyme RNA polymerase catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the rNTPs, creating a chain of RNA nucleotides that is complementary to the DNA template strand.\n\nThe RNA molecule formed during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing, including the removal of non-coding regions called introns and the addition of a protective cap and a poly-A tail. This processed mRNA is then transported out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm.\n\nIn the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. The process of protein synthesis, called translation, involves the coordinated action of different types of RNA. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) play significant roles in this process. Ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, bind to the mRNA at the start codon, and tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. The ribosome reads the mRNA codons and links the amino acids together in the order specified by the sequence of the codons. This forms a polypeptide chain, which subsequently folds into a functional protein.\n\nIn summary, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis through transcription, where the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed and transferred to RNA molecules. This mRNA then carries the information to the ribosomes for protein synthesis through the process of translation, involving the coordinated action of rRNA and tRNA. These proteins are essential for various cellular functions, including cell structure, signaling, and metabolism.\n\nReferences:\n- Molecular biology of the cell. Alberts B, et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 6th edition. 2014.\n- Nelson DL, Cox MM. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 7th edition. 2017.\n\nIn both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, transcription and translation are essential processes involved in gene expression. However, there are notable differences between the two processes in these cell types.\n\nIn prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, which is the cytoplasm. The process of transcription in prokaryotes involves the binding of RNA polymerase to the DNA template, initiating RNA synthesis. This process does not require extensive regulation and occurs in a simplified manner compared to eukaryotes. The RNA molecule produced, called messenger RNA (mRNA), is then immediately available for translation.\n\nOn the other hand, eukaryotic cells have their DNA enclosed in a nucleus, where transcription occurs. The DNA in eukaryotic cells is often packaged with histone and nonhistone proteins into chromatin, which can act as a barrier to the transcription process. Transcription in eukaryotes requires the chromatin structure to change so that the DNA becomes accessible to RNA polymerase. Once the RNA molecule is transcribed, it undergoes additional processing steps, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, as well as the removal of introns. This processed mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in ribosomes, which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. The mRNA molecule serves as a template for protein synthesis during translation. The process of decoding the information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation. It involves the recognition of a start codon (usually AUG) on the mRNA by the ribosome, and the subsequent assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain based on the genetic code. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading each codon and adding the corresponding amino acid until it reaches a stop codon, at which point the polypeptide chain is released.\n\nOverall, the processes of transcription and translation are more complex and regulated in eukaryotic cells compared to prokaryotic cells.

The two ships sighted each other when they were about a 1/2 nmi apart. The captain of Pisagua burnt a warning flare, which was seen by the crew and senior officer on duty on the bridge of Oceana, who then gave the order to turn to port.

Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard.\nDescription: SCP-3105 is a neurotropic virus, exhibiting morphological similarities to Rabies lyssavirus. SCP-3105 is able to infect almost all animals to some extent, though the infection it causes is asymptomatic in non-human hosts. SCP-3105 can be transmitted by airborne particles, bodily fluids, or an animal vector1.\nIn humans, SCP-3105 enters the bloodstream and infects neural pathways. It travels through nerve axons via retrograde transport to reach the central nervous system, in a manner very similar to R. lyssavirus. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. Symptoms of infection will begin to present themselves an average of 5 days after contraction, though this value varies wildly, depending on the location and mode of initial infection, from 2 hours to 14 days. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious.\nOnce SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. It will infect and destroy neurons involved in this process over the course of two days. The method by which SCP-3105 identifies target cells is unknown, and presumed to be anomalous. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia.\nAfter destroying much of the medial temporal lobe, SCP-3105 will infect peripheral glial cells that are left behind, allowing it to remain dormant in the central nervous system for up to 3 months. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. This results in severe retrograde amnesia, resulting in inhibition of basic cognitive functionality. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days.\nSCP-3105 infection also triggers the secretion of cytokines3, deactivating cytoxic T-cells and preventing an effective immune response. This mechanism also prevents artificial attempts at preemptive immunization.\nRecovered autobiographical text from an SCP-3105 victim seem to indicate the retention of some memories, despite the observed destruction of the tissues required to store and consolidate this information. Furthermore, the information presented in the text seems to be shared between several individuals. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon.\nInitial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. Armed Response Force Omega-6 was mobilized with the express purpose of destroying all SCP-3105 instances using incendiary munitions. The resulting wildfire was allowed to burn until noticed by firefighting services in the region, and was explained as an accident involving Spruce Creek's stores of emergency gasoline.\nThe following is a series of notes collected from the forest surrounding Spruce Creek. Monospaced text represents physical notes4, whereas standard text represents unsent messages and journal entries recovered from an abandoned mobile phone. The material has been ordered chronologically, based on digital timestamps, location of recovery, and chemical dating.

Four sailing ships are clearly visible against the pink sky. On the left of the canvas, a sharp, rocky cliff face is seen, breaking up the composition. Bricher clearly depicts each wave rolling onto the beach in minute detail. The Sun is positioned a little left of center of the canvas, but is the major focal point, drawing the eye in. Just like other Hudson River School painters, Bricher hides his brushstrokes, as if to make the canvas disappear.\n\n they had rounded this corner they were in view of the Heads themselves. From the distant cliffs there ran out, on either side, brown reefs, which made the inrushing water dance and foam, and the entrance to the Bay narrow and dangerous: on one side, there projected the portion of a wreck which had lain there as long as Laura had been in the world. Then, having made a sharp turn to the left, the boat crossed to the opposite coast, and steamed past barrack-like buildings lying asleep in the fierce sunshine of the afternoon; and, in due course, it stopped at Laura's destination.'\"\n\n The first impression that the painting creates is of an enormous deep-red sunset over a stormy sea, an indication of an approaching typhoon. This ominous typhoon is further indicated by an approaching dramatized storm cloud, creeping into the visible space from the left, with its rich colors sprawling towards an unstained sky. Upon closer inspection one can discern a ship sailing off into the distance. This ship is identifiable as a type of fast vessel used by slavers to escape navy patrollers, characterized by its \"low, lean lines and clipper bow.\" The masts of the ship are red, matching the blood-red color of the sky and the sickly copper color of the water, which serves to blur the lines between various objects in the painting. The ship's sails are furled, revealing that it is preparing for the typhoon.

Soon the First Great Awakening stirred Protestants throughout America. Evangelical preachers emphasized personal salvation and piety more than ritual and tradition. Pamphlets and printed sermons crisscrossed the Atlantic, encouraging the revivalists. The Awakening resulted from powerful preaching that gave listeners a sense of deep personal revelation of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ. Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made Christianity intensely personal to the average person by fostering a deep sense of spiritual conviction and redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to \n\n The religious excitement at Red River inspired what would later become a regular feature of Kentucky revivalism—camping at the site. In July 1800, the first camp meeting of the Second Great Awakening took place near the Gasper River. Previous to 1800, long-distance travelers attending the multi-day sacrament observance would make arrangements to stay with neighboring families, but as the news of the revivals spread, the combination of the people’s desire to linger, and the practicalities associated with the needs of large numbers of people from great distances, inspired families to come prepared to camp at the site. McGready realized the potential for the innovation when protracted meetings continued into the night, and one family at Red River came ready to camp for the duration. He \n\n The Revival of 1800, also known as the Red River Revival, was a series of evangelical Christian meetings which began in Logan County, Kentucky. These ignited the subsequent events and influenced several of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening. The events represented a transition from British traditions to innovations arising from the unique needs and culture of Americans in the new century, especially on the frontier. The startling manifestations of revival fervor that first occurred in June 1800 at the Red River Meeting House, a small Presbyterian congregation led by James McGready, began as a Scottish sacrament service, but led to the important innovation of serial religious services later \n\n During the Second Great Awakening, Protestantism grew and took root in new areas, along with new Protestant denominations such as Adventism, the Restoration Movement, and groups such as Mormonism. While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second Great Awakening (1800&ndash;1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Bishop Francis Asbury led the American Methodist movement as one of the most prominent religious leaders of the young republic. Traveling throughout the eastern seaboard, Methodism grew quickly under Asbury's leadership into one of the nation's largest and most influential denominations.

A recent folk tradition that adapts a custom from France is the Tintamarre parade of Acadia, similar to France's Medieval Charivari festivities.\n\n  In Canada, Quebec City, Quebec holds an ice sculpture festival each year during the Quebec City Winter Carnival. The sculpture festival lasts about three weeks. For the sheer variety of ice sculptures and the number of visitors, the Quebec festival is regarded by some as the best in the world. Each year, about twenty teams are chosen to participate in the competition. Half of these teams come from Canada and the others come from other countries. Ice sculpting started to become important in Quebec in the 1880s, as traditional sculptors, like Louis Jobin, turned their skills on this less permanent medium. Each year Lake Louise, located in Banff National Park, holds a three-day event called Ice Magic in \n\n The Quebec Winter Carnival (Carnaval de Québec), commonly known in both English and French as Carnaval, is a pre-Lenten festival held in Quebec City. After being held intermittently since 1894, the Carnaval de Québec has been celebrated annually since 1955. That year, Bonhomme Carnaval, the mascot of the festival, made his first appearance. Up to one million people attended the Carnaval de Québec in 2006 making it, at the time, the largest winter festival in the world (since overtaken by the Harbin Festival). It is, however, the largest winter festival in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n as \"Bonhomme Carnaval\" (a man in a stylized snowman costume with a stocking cap or a top hat) is a common mascot at Quebec winter carnivals.

He is the 1980 Olympic champion, the 1980 European champion, a three-time World medalist (1978–1980) and four-time British national champion (1977–1980), obtaining all of these titles during his amateur career. He followed this with a successful career as a professional figure skater and later starred in ice shows as well as producing several of his own. He is able to spin in either direction, both clockwise and anti-clockwise, which is an unusual skill for a figure skater. Off the ice, Cousins has commentated on figure skating events for the BBC, and he assumed the position of head judge on ITV's Dancing on Ice show from 2006 to 2014.

The show was hosted by celebrity gardener and backyard designer Jamie Durie and former Today weather presenter Sami Lukis. It was based on the British ITV show Dancing on Ice, which also featured Torvill and Dean, and is also roughly similar to an earlier Nine program Skating on Thin Ice, also hosted by Durie, in 2005. Kristina, Pam and Matt were also skating partners for the celebrities in the original UK version.

His interest in music was triggered by his mother, Doris, who played records by Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine and Louis Armstrong, and his maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore Dupree, a former big band player, who encouraged him to take up the guitar. In his teens he met up with Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered that they both shared a love of blues music. In the early 1960s Richards moved into a London flat, shared with Jagger and Brian Jones. Together with Bill Wyman, Ian Stewart and Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones were founded in 1962, playing gigs at Ealing Jazz \n\n the famous Gretsch drum set that he continued to play with the Stones until his death, as well as his first employment of a china cymbal as a crash. The concerts featured backing vocals by Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards, something that the Stones would get away from beginning with their next tour when Richards handled the majority of the backing vocals himself. However, this United States tour did not carry on into Europe in 1979, breaking the group's similar schedule of performing in Europe every three years, which had started in 1967. This gap-year from touring prompted Keith Richards to join Ronnie Wood on his 1979 United States solo tour, to promote his then-album Gimme Some Neck, in the process forming the band The New Barbarians.\n\n It Bleed, which was released after his death. (Jones did, however, contribute to the group's hit song \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\", which was part of the same sessions, and released in May 1968.) Nearly all rhythm and lead guitar parts were recorded by Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones' other guitarist and the primary songwriting partner of their lead singer Mick Jagger; together the two wrote all but one of the tracks on the album. Rounding out the instrumentation were bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, though all members contributed on a variety of instruments. As with most albums of the period, frequent collaborator Nicky Hopkins played piano on many of the tracks. \n\n  In mid-1962, Watts first met Brian Jones, Ian \"Stu\" Stewart, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, who also frequented the London rhythm and blues clubs, but it was not until January 1963 that Watts finally agreed to join the Rolling Stones. Initially, the band could not afford to pay Watts, who had been earning a regular salary from his gigs. His first public appearance as a permanent member was at the Ealing Jazz Club on 2 February 1963. Watts was often introduced as \"The Wembley Whammer\" by Jagger during live concerts. Besides his work as a musician, Watts contributed graphic art and comic strips to early Rolling Stones records such as the Between the Buttons record sleeve and was responsible for the 1975 tour announcement press conference in New York City.

Paul was in contact with this community. Legitimised by Jesus' appearance, Peter was the first leader of the Jerusalem ekklēsia. He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord,\" which may explain why the early texts contain scarce information about Peter. According to Lüdemann, in the discussions about the strictness of adherence to the Jewish Law, the more conservative faction of James the Just took the overhand over the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence. According to Dunn, this was not an \"usurpation of power,\" but a consequence of Peter's involvement in missionary activities. According to Eusebius' Church History 4.5.3–4: the first 15 Christian Bishops of Jerusalem were \"of the circumcision\". The Romans destroyed the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem in year 135 during the Bar Kokhba revolt, but it is traditionally believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.\n\n Some early Jewish Christians believed that non-Jews must convert to Judaism and adopt Jewish customs in order to be saved. Paul criticized Peter for himself declining to eat with gentiles during a visit by some of these Christians and therefore presenting a poor example to non-Jews joining the Christians. Paul's close coworker Barnabas sided with Peter in this dispute. Those that taught that gentile converts to Christianity ought to adopt more Jewish practices to be saved, however, were called \"Judaizers\". Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch and at the Council of Jerusalem. Nevertheless, Judaizing continued to be encouraged for several centuries, \n\n Paul seems to have refused \"to be tied down to particular patterns of behavior and practice.\" He does not engage in a dispute with those Corinthians who apparently feel quite free to eat anything offered to idols, never appealing or even mentioning the Jerusalem council. He rather attempts to persuade them by appealing to the care they should have for other believers who might not feel so free. Paul himself described several meetings with the apostles in Jerusalem, though it is difficult to reconcile any of them fully with the account in Acts (see also Paul the Apostle). Paul claims he \"went up again to Jerusalem\" (i.e., not the first time) with Barnabas and Titus \"in response to a revelation\", in order to \"lay before them the gospel \n\n by Jewish Christians. Paul opposed the strict applications of Jewish customs for gentile converts, and argued with the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, where Paul met with the \"pillars of Jerusalem Church\" (whom Paul identifies as Peter, Jesus's brother James, and John) over whether gentile Christians need to keep the Jewish Law and be circumcised. According to Acts, James played a prominent role in the formulation of the council's decision ( NRSV) that circumcision was not a requirement. In Galatians, Paul says that James, Peter and John will minister to the \"circumcised\" (in general Jews and Jewish proselytes) \n\n started proselytizing among the gentiles, adopting the title \"Apostle to the Gentiles\". He persuaded the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, which opened the way for a much larger Christian Church, extending far beyond the Jewish community. While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James. Paul was, before his conversion, an antagonist of the followers of Jesus. Initially he persecuted the \"church of God.\" Then converted, starting to proselytize among the gentiles.\n\nQuestion: which apostle spoke at the council of jerusalem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Pop also admitted that the album is his response to being \"sick of listening to idiot thugs with guitars banging out crappy music\". The album includes a cover of the 1940s French jazz standard \"Les feuilles mortes\" (\"Autumn Leaves\"), which Iggy sings in French. The song is most associated with such artists as Yves Montand and Édith Piaf. The album also includes \"How Insensitive\", a jazzy bossa nova standard composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim, and \"Nice to Be Dead\", more of a swamp rock song. The visuals for the album were created by French-Iranian graphic novelist and animated film director Marjane Satrapi.

At the third Session of the Australasian Federation Convention of 1898, Western Australian premier and future federal cabinet member John Forrest summarised the prevailing feeling: The Barton Government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the Australian Workers Union and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded. The first \n\n was aged only 37, and is still the youngest Prime Minister in Australia's history. George Reid of the Free Trade Party adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs. non-Labour lines prior to the 1906 federal election and renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm. Although Watson further strengthened Labour's position in 1906, he stepped down from the leadership the \n\n Thirty people have served as Prime Minister of Australia since the office was created in 1901. The parties shown are those to which the prime ministers belonged at the time they held office, and the electoral divisions shown are those they represented while in office. Several prime ministers belonged to parties other than those given and represented other electorates before and after their time in office. Since the office was established in 1901, 29 men and one woman have served as prime minister. Robert Menzies and Kevin Rudd served two non-consecutive terms in office while Alfred Deakin and Andrew Fisher served three non-consecutive terms; the 30th and current \n\n Sir Edmund \"Toby\" Barton, (18 January 1849 – 7 January 1920) was an Australian politician and judge who served as the first prime minister of Australia from 1901 to 1903, holding office as the leader of the Protectionist Party. He resigned to become a founding member of the High Court of Australia, where he served until his death. Barton was an early supporter of the federation of the Australian colonies, the goal of which he summarised as \"a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation\". After the retirement of Henry Parkes he came to be seen as the leader of the federation \n\n at the 1903 federal election and continued to hold the balance of power. In April 1904, however, Watson and Alfred Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover state public servants, the fallout causing Deakin to resign. Free Trade leader George Reid declined to take office, which saw Watson become the first Labour Prime Minister of Australia, and the world's first Labour head of government at a national level (Anderson Dawson had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899), though his was a minority government that lasted only four months. \n\nQuestion: when was the first australian prime minister elected\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song incorporates several aggressive themes, largely dealing with the struggles dealt with by B-Rabbit, and how he eventually overcomes his many problems and obstacles to gain the respect of other rappers. The song's production incorporates piano, drums, violins, and several other string instruments. The song is one of four new Eminem solo songs on the soundtrack, the other three being \"8 Mile\", \"Rabbit Run\" and \"Stimulate\" (included on deluxe edition only).

Nintendo licensed the Mario characters but was otherwise not involved in the game's development, nor was Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. The Software Toolworks released the game for MS-DOS in January 1993. Mario Is Missing! marked Luigi's first starring role in a video game, followed by Luigi's Mansion (2001), Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon (2013), and Luigi's Mansion 3 (2019). Nintendo later re-released the game for their own video game consoles. In the United States, The Software Toolworks had released the NES and SNES versions by June 1993. By October 1993, Mindscape had published said NES and SNES versions in Europe. The SNES version used audio and visual assets from Super Mario World. The DOS version uses stretched-out character animations, unlike the later versions. In the United States, The Software Toolworks released a Macintosh version on CD-ROM and floppy disks in June 1994, under the title ''Mario Is Missing! CD-ROM Deluxe''. The new version included 127 QuickTime clips featuring 99 landmarks, including the Golden Gate Bridge and the Great Wall of China.\n\n controller design was reused from Nintendo's portable Game & Watch games. Several add-ons were released, such as a light gun for shooting games. The NES featured a number of groundbreaking games, such as the platform game Super Mario Bros. and the action-adventure games The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, each of which became long-running Nintendo franchises. One of the bestselling consoles of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. It introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers to produce and distribute games. The NES was succeeded in 1990 by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n (as opposed to text), using the Mattel Intellivoice module. The game was sophisticated for its time, but was a commercial failure, released around the time of the video game crash of 1983 when the North American home video game market collapsed. Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo Vs. System, starting with Baseball (1983) and Tennis (1984). They played an important role in the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System, as they were the earliest NES games released in North America, initially in the arcades and then with the console's launch. Nintendo's arcade version VS. Baseball (1984) was competing \n\n During the third generation of video game consoles, tutorials on video game mechanics were rare, and players instead were oriented to a new video game by its level design. The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed in such a way that players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the player with obstacles indiscriminately, the first level of Super Mario Bros. introduces the variety of hazards and objects by directing the player to interact with them while advancing through the level. Miyamoto explained that he designed World 1-1 to contain everything players need to \"gradually and naturally understand what they're doing\", to be able to play more freely, so that it becomes \"their game\".\n\n Released July 15, 1983, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit video game console released by Nintendo in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa and was Nintendo's first home video game console released outside Japan. In Japan, it is known as the \"Family Computer\" (or \"Famicom\", as it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from game design to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted third-party developers. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts. Nintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016. Called the NES Classic Edition, it is a dedicated console that comes with a single controller and 30 preloaded games.\n\nQuestion: what was the first video game for nintendo\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund Strait. At 450295 km2, Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe, the third-largest country in the European Union, and the fifth largest country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total population of 10.4 million; and a low population density of 25.5 PD/km2. 87% of Swedes live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area. The highest concentration is in the central and \n\n Approximately 91% of people test positive for Sd(a) through blood typing, and 96% test positive through urine testing. The Sd(a++) phenotype is rare, especially in Europe, but may be more common in East Asian populations.\n\n The prevalence of the Lan antigen exceeds 99.9% in most populations. The frequency of the Lan-negative blood type is estimated at 1 in 50,000 in Japanese populations, 1 in 20,000 in Caucasians, and 1 in 1,500 in black people from South Africa.\n\nVIRAL HEPATITIS\n\nDonated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.All blood donations are tested for infection with the organisms that cause viral hepatitis, AIDS, selected other viral disorders (such as West Nile virus), Chagas' disease, and syphilis.A person with AB-positive blood has red blood cells that have A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative. A blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type. Therefore, before a transfusion, blood banks do a test called a \"type and crossmatch\" on the donor's and the recipient's blood. This test minimizes the chance of a dangerous or possibly fatal reaction. However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells. Thus, people with type O blood are known as universal donors. People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients. Recipients whose blood is Rh-negative must receive blood from Rh-negative donors, but recipients whose blood is Rh-positive may receive Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood. Generally, donors are not allowed to give blood more than once every 56 days. The practice of paying donors for blood has almost disappeared,\n\nTesting Donated Blood for Infections\n\nBlood transfusions can transmit infectious organisms carried in the donor's blood. That is why health officials have restricted blood donor eligibility and made blood testing thorough. All blood donations are tested for infection with the organisms that cause viral hepatitis, AIDS, selected other viral disorders (such as West Nile virus), Chagas' disease, and syphilis. VIRAL HEPATITIS\n\nDonated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.Hepatitis B remains the most common potentially serious disorder transmitted by blood transfusions, with a current risk of about 1 infection for every 137,000 units of blood transfused.AIDS\n\nIn the United States, donated blood is tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS.\n\nA blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type.The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative.Some blood types are far more common than others.Conditions that permanently disqualify a person from donating blood include hepatitis B or C, heart disease, certain types of cancer (leukemia, lymphoma, and any type of cancer that has recurred after treatment or that has ever been treated with chemotherapy drugs), severe asthma, bleeding disorders, possible exposure to prion diseases (such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—see Overview of Prion Diseases), AIDS, and possible exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS) due to high-risk behaviors (see Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection). Conditions that temporarily disqualify a person include malaria (if it has been less than 3 years since the person last experienced symptoms), cancer that has been treated with surgery or radiation (if it has been less than 5 years since the person last received treatment), pregnancy, recent major surgery, poorly controlled high blood pressure, low blood pressure, anemia, the use of certain drugs, exposure to some forms of hepatitis, and a recent blood transfusion. Blood Typing\n\nBlood is classified by type. A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. For example, a person with O-negative blood has red blood cells that lack both A and B antigens and the Rh factor. A person with AB-positive blood has red blood cells that have A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative.

Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families. The New York Times editorial board wrote in August 2013: \"As measured by the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is lower paid today than at any time in modern memory.

As of December 2013, there were 21 states with minimum wages above the Federal minimum, with the State of Washington the highest at $9.32. Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. A smaller increase to $9.00 per hour would reduce employment by 100,000, while about 7.6 million workers would have higher pay.\n\n The Minimum Wage Fairness Act is a bill that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress.\n\n StateMinimumWages-USA-20140101.png and U.S. territory (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), as of January 1, 2014. ]] In the United States workers generally must be paid no less than the statutory minimum wage.

The guidance does not normally apply to domestic premises. Prior to the Order, under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, all public and commercial buildings, and all non-single-household domestic dwellings (apart from houses in multiple occupation), were required to hold a valid fire safety certificate issued annually after an inspection by the Fire Service. This regime was replaced with assessment by third-party fire-risk assessors contracted by building owners and landlords, with no mandated timeframe for checks, and no mandated professional qualifications. In 2013, the Fire Service found that 14% of risk assessments were non-compliant with the law, and in 2018 it was found that 500 out of 800 of the UK's fire risk assessors were not registered with accredited bodies.\n\n In England and Wales Fire Safety Inspectors are given additional powers to firefighters in order to carry out routine inspections, investigate the commission of fire safety related offences and prohibit or restrict the use of un-safe buildings. They also issue other legal notices. Their powers are derived not only from the Fire Rescue Services Act 2004 but also Article 27 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Health & Safety at Work Act etc 1974, Fireworks Act 2003, and the Licensing Act 2003 including other pieces of legislation. Upon the granting of a warrant from a Magistrate, Fire Inspectors may use force to make entry into a premises for the purposes of securing evidence, investigating the commission of an offence or to make an inspection. Usually this is done with the Police in attendance. Any persons suspected of committing an offence are ordinarily placed under caution and invited for an interview under PACE conditions. Committing a fire safety-related offence includes summary and indictable offences which means for more serious cases the offenders could be sent to prison.\n\n Once a building is occupied the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (Fire Safety Order 2005 - FSO2005) requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the \"Responsible Person(s)\" for the building to provide and maintain \"suitable and sufficient\" general fire precautions. Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect. The FSO2005 is criminal law, and breaches of this law can result in the \"Responsible Person\" being jailed for up to two years and fined up to £10,000 for each offence. Corporate offences may have unlimited fines. Enforcement is by the local fire authority. It may be necessary to exceed the recommendations of the guidance supporting Part B of Schedule 1 to Building Regulations, in order to achieve a suitable and sufficient level of fire safety required under the FSO2005.\n\n (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. These regulations were brought in to require premises having over a threshold quantity or using certain named hazardous substances to possess a fire certificate. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. These regulations also applied to temporary buildings associated with construction work. Fire certificates were required for some of these buildings, and there were some fire safety obligations generally imposed in respect of those temporary buildings, which did not require a fire certificate. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.)\n\n In England and Wales, the powers to make building regulations were consolidated and re-enacted in 1984. All building regulations made by the Secretary of State since then have included minimum fire safety measures (for both physical fire resistance and safe means of escape) for all new, extended or altered buildings. The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. See Approved Document - Part B - Fire Safety Vol 1 & 2 (available to download free from the UK Government's \"Planning Portal\" website). A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. Building Regulation (Reg.16B) now require a developer or architect to hand over sufficient fire safety information to the building's future responsible person, so he may commission an appropriate fire risk assessment for the new building and its occupiers and/or users. Note: building regulations and fire safety laws are different, but similar, in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nQuestion: when did the the regulatory reform ( fire safety ) order 2005 first come into effect\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Using songs written by others, Seeger focused on popularizing and promoting the ethic of local, historical musical influences and recognizing the cultural significance that folk music embodies. Springsteen's project began in 1997, when he recorded \"We Shall Overcome\" for the Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger tribute album, released the following year. Springsteen had not known much about Seeger given his rock and roll upbringing, and proceeded to investigate Seeger's music. While playing them in his house, his 10-year-old daughter said, \"Hey, that sounds like fun,\" which gave Springsteen more reason to continue. Soozie Tyrell, the violinist in the E Street Band, connected with a group of lesser-known musicians from New Jersey and New York City, and they joined Springsteen to record in an informal setting in Springsteen's Colts Neck farm. The Miami Horns and Springsteen's wife Patti Scialfa participated. This group would become the Sessions Band. The subsequent Bruce Springsteen with the Seeger Sessions Band Tour expanded on the album's musical approach.\n\nThe Balham Alligators ; Gary U.S. Bonds and Bruce Springsteen (Springsteen had originally recorded the song for his 1980 album, The River, but it was never released and he decided to re-record the song with Bonds for his 1981 album, Dedication) . Subsequently, Springsteen has occasionally performed the song live. ; The Flatlanders ; Joan Baez included a recording of the song on her 1970 album (I Live) One Day at a Time. Some recent covers of the song have been made by Cajun revival and popular artists, though these have not enjoyed the same widespread popularity. The following are some of the artists who have covered \"Jole Blon\":  In 2002, Bear Family records released \"Jole Blon: 23 Artists One Theme\". In 2009, an unknown publisher, T. Basco, released a three-volume set called Peepin' Thru the Keyhole which contains virtually every version of \"Jolie Blonde\" that has ever been recorded and popularized. In 2013, Goldenlane Records released \"Jole Blon & The Cajun Music Story\" compilation CD with many of the popular versions. The title of the song is referenced in Mary Chapin Carpenter's 1991 song \"Down at the Twist and Shout\" and Adam Carroll's 2000 song \"Errol's Song\".\n\n The song is a tribute to two anarchists of Italian origin, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were sentenced to death by a United States court in the 1920s for the murder of a payroll clerk and a guard. The consensus of critical opinion has since concluded that the ruling was influenced by bias against Sacco and Vanzetti's anarchist political beliefs rather than being based on any proof that they committed the robbery and murders of which they were accused. The lyrics for \"Here's to You\" make use of a statement attributed to Vanzetti by Philip D. Strong, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, who visited Vanzetti \n\n Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He has released twenty studio albums, many of which feature his backing band the E Street Band. Originally from the Jersey Shore, he is one of the originators of the heartland rock style of music, combining mainstream rock musical style with narrative songs about working class American life. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length. He has been nicknamed \"the Boss\".

The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted.

These coins are both designated in the section as \"legal tender\" in payment of debts. The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar, in contrast to the American Silver Eagle which is pure silver. Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins, which have values ranging from one cent (U.S. Penny) to 100 dollars. These other coins \n\n The United States dollar (symbol: ; code: USD; also abbreviated US$ or U.S. Dollar, to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; referred to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, American dollar, or colloquially buck) is the official currency of the United States and its territories. The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. U.S. banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, popularly called greenbacks due to their historically predominantly green color. The monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System, which acts as the nation's central bank. The U.S. dollar was originally defined under a bimetallic standard of 371.25 gr fine silver or, from 1837, 23.22 gr fine gold, or $20.67 per troy ounce.

Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details.

It is located bilaterally along the dorsolateral side of the spinal cord. The DRG serves as a crucial relay station for incoming sensory information from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. \n\nThe primary function of the DRG is to receive and transmit sensory information such as pain, touch, temperature, and proprioception from various parts of the body to the spinal cord and ultimately to the brain. The sensory neurons within the DRG have specialized nerve endings in the skin, muscles, and other tissues that detect sensory stimuli. These stimuli are then converted into electrical signals that travel along the axons of the sensory neurons and enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots.\n\nOnce inside the spinal cord, the sensory information is processed and integrated with other signals before being transmitted to the brain for further interpretation and perception. The DRG plays a critical role in this initial step of sensory processing by relaying the sensory information from the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord.\n\nIn summary, the DRG is a specialized structure located along the dorsolateral side of the spinal cord. It houses the cell bodies of sensory neurons and serves as a relay station for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system.\n\n The spinal cord transmits sensory reception from the peripheral nervous system. It also conducts motor information to the body's skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, smooth muscles, and glands. There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves along the spinal cord, all of which consist of both sensory and motor neurons. The spinal cord is protected by vertebrae and connects the peripheral nervous system to the brain, and it acts as a \"minor\" coordinating center.\n\nThe spinal cord is organized into two main parts: the white matter and the gray matter. The white matter, which is located on the outer part of the spinal cord, consists of ascending and descending nerve fibers that connect to and from the brain, as well as fibers that connect different levels of the spinal cord. These nerve fibers play a crucial role in transmitting information between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\nOn the other hand, the gray matter forms an inner butterfly-shaped pattern surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. It contains the cell bodies of neurons as well as nerve fibers. The gray matter is further divided into dorsal (posterior) horns and ventral (anterior) horns.\n\nThe ventral horns of the gray matter contain large cell bodies of motor neurons. These motor neurons are responsible for controlling movements in the body, particularly the movement of the upper and lower limbs. The dorsal horns of the gray matter contain neurons that receive, process, and transmit information from sensory neurons. The sensory neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia.\n\nIt is important to note that the size of the gray matter and, consequently, the size of the spinal cord, can vary at different levels. In areas where the gray matter contains many large motor nerve cells that control limb movement, the gray matter and spinal cord are considerably larger compared to areas where the gray matter contains motor neurons for the muscles of the torso.\n\nIn summary, the two main parts of the spinal cord are the white matter, responsible for transmitting information to and from the brain, and the gray matter, which contains the cell bodies of neurons and plays a role in motor control and sensory processing.\n\nReference: A cross-section through the lower lumbar region of the spinal cord is shown here. Spinal cord, human, silver stain ×16.\n\nAfferent nerve fibers play a crucial role in relaying sensory information from sensory receptors to different regions of the brain. These nerves are carried by sensory nerves and are responsible for transmitting sensory signals to the central nervous system. The information carried by afferent projections helps us perceive and interpret various sensations.\n\nIn the peripheral nervous system, afferent and efferent nerve fibers are part of the somatic nervous system and originate outside of the spinal cord. Afferent fibers are carried by sensory nerves into the spinal cord, while efferent fibers are carried by motor nerves out of the spinal cord to act on skeletal muscles. This allows for voluntary and conscious movements.\n\nIt's important to note that afferent neurons are pseudounipolar neurons, meaning they have a single process leaving the cell body that divides into two branches. One branch extends towards the sensory organ, while the other, shorter branch, connects to the central nervous system, such as the spinal cord.\n\nThe cell bodies of afferent neurons are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, specifically in the dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. These ganglia contain thousands of afferent neuronal cell bodies.\n\nAfferent nerve fibers are involved in transmitting somatosensory information, which includes sensations like pain, touch, temperature, itch, and stretch. For example, certain afferent neurons called intrafusal muscle fibers function as stretch receptors by detecting changes in muscle length.\n\nAll of these sensory signals travel along specific pathways towards the brain. One important pathway is the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which transmits sensations from the periphery via afferent nerve fibers. This pathway is responsible for relaying fine touch, vibration, and proprioception (the sense of body position).\n\nIn summary, afferent nerve fibers serve the role of conveying sensory information from the sensory receptors to the brain. They are essential for our perception of various sensations and contribute to our overall sensory experience.\n\nSensory neurons play a crucial role in transmitting information within the nervous system. They are divided into different segments, each with a specific function. One of these segments is the peripheral segment, which brings information from the periphery to the cell body. This segment is responsible for collecting sensory stimuli from various parts of the body.\n\nThe other segment is the central segment, which carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord. This segment allows the sensory information to be processed and integrated within the central nervous system. In this process, synapses occur only in the gray matter, which is where the cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located.\n\nSensory neurons are classified as pseudounipolar neurons and have cell bodies located in ganglia along the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Pseudounipolar neurons have a single process that divides into peripheral and central segments.\n\nTo summarize, the peripheral segment of a sensory neuron brings information from the periphery to the cell body, while the central segment carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord for further processing and integration within the nervous system.\n\nReference: They have a single process that divides into a peripheral segment that brings information from the periphery to the cell body and a central segment that carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are pseudounipolar (Plate 27, page 390). Nuclei of the CNS are the morphologic and functional equivalents of the ganglia of the PNS. Synapses occur only in the gray matter. The cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located in the ventral (anterior) horn of the gray matter. Ventral motor neurons, also called anterior horn cells, are large basophilic cells easily recognized in routine histologic preparations (see Fig. 12.30 and Plate 31, page 398). Because the motor neuron conducts impulses away from the CNS, it is an efferent neuron. The axon of a motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, passes through the ventral (anterior) root, becomes a component of the spinal nerve of that segment, and as such is conveyed to the muscle. The axon is myelinated except at its origin and termination. Near the muscle cell, the axon divides into numerous terminal branches that form neuromuscular junctions with the muscle cell (see page 322). The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in ganglia that lie on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are pseudounipol.\n\nQuestion: where are unipolar neurons found in spinal cord\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The domain was officially delegated to DotSite Inc (part of Radix) on 12 March 2015. In 2000, years prior to its current ownership, the company Affilias LLC attempted to apply for ownership of the TLD, along with .info and .web.\n\n The Internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to associate numeric computer IP addresses with human-readable names. The top level of the domain name hierarchy, the DNS root, contains the top-level domains that appear as the suffixes of all Internet domain names. The most widely used (and first) DNS root is administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). In addition, several organizations operate alternative DNS roots, often referred to as alt roots. These alternative domain name systems operate their own root name servers and commonly administer their own specific name spaces consisting of custom top-level domains. The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) has spoken out strongly against alternate roots in.\n\n allocate a two-level domain name.

Any fully qualified domain name can be a host or a subdomain. A domain name that does not include any subdomains is known as an apex domain, root domain, or bare domain. For example,  is the apex domain of Wikipedia, which redirects to the subdomain.\n\ndn: distinguished name ; This refers to the name that uniquely identifies an entry in the directory. ; dc: domain component ; This refers to each component of the domain. For example www.mydomain.com would be written as DC=www,DC=mydomain,DC=com ; ou: organizational unit ; This refers to the organizational unit (or sometimes the user group) that the user is part of. If the user is part of more than one group, you may specify as such, e.g., OU= Lawyer,OU= Judge. ; cn: common name ; This refers to the individual object (person's name; meeting room; recipe name; job title; etc.) for whom/which you are querying. \n\n The definitive descriptions of the rules for forming domain names appear in RFC 1035, RFC 1123, RFC 2181, and RFC 5892. A domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called labels, that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com. The right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain com. The hierarchy of domains descends from right to left; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example, the label example specifies a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels. A label may contain zero to 63 \n\nQuestion: what are the parts of a domain name called\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The rights to host the 2018 World Cup were eventually awarded to Russia. At a conference in Qatar in March 2012, Premier League chairman and deputy chairman of the 2018 bid, Dave Richards, said FIFA allowed the FA to waste money on their 2018 World Cup bid when, he claimed, they had little chance of winning it, stating \"Why couldn't FIFA have said we want to take it to the Gulf? We spent £19m on that bid. When we went for it everybody believed we had a chance.

Villanova competed as an independent until joining the Colonial Athletic Association in 2002; winning the CAA tournament for their first title in 2009. The fourth-seeded Wildcats were the lowest-seeded champions in conference tournament history but had qualified for conference tournament for the fifth year in a row. Villanova also made their first NCAA tournament appearance in 2009 but lost in the first round to the top-seeded Virginia, 18–6.\n\n The 2014–15 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team represented Villanova University in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Led by head coach Jay Wright in his 14th season, the Wildcats participated as members of the Big East Conference and played their home games at The Pavilion, with some select home games at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They finished the season 33–3, 16–2 in Big East play to win the Big East regular season championship. They defeated Marquette, Providence, and Xavier to win the Big East Tournament. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 seed in the East Region. They defeated Lafayette in the Second Round before being upset in the Third Round by NC State. The Wildcats set a single-season school record for wins with 33.\n\n The 1995–96 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team represented Villanova University in the 1995–96 season. Led by consensus First team All-American Senior Kerry Kittles, who became and remains Villanova's all-time leading scorer, the highly ranked Wildcats made their second appearance in the NCAA Tournament since the departure of Rollie Massimino. With an overall record 24-5 and conference record of 14–4, the Wildcats placed second in the Big East Conference, and after reaching the semifinals of the Big East tournament, the team was invited to the NCAA tournament as a 3 seed. In the NCAA tournament, the Wildcats would gain their first tournament win under Fourth Year head coach Steve Lappas, over 14 seed Portland. In the round of 32, the Wildcats would prove to be competitive, but fall to 6 seed Louisville by four points.\n\n Jay Wright credits the play to the \"Wildcat minute\", where the team practices late-game scenarios at every practice. The game has been called one of the greatest in the history of NCAA Tournament Championships. Villanova ended the 2016 season at 35–5 including the unanimous #1 ranking in the final Coaches' Poll (USA Today) while capturing their 2nd NCAA basketball championship trophy in the history of the program. In beating #3 seed Miami (AP #10), #1 seed Kansas (AP #1), #2 seed Oklahoma (AP #7) and #1 seed UNC (AP #3), Villanova became the first school in 31 years — since the 1985 Villanova Wildcats — to not only beat four top-three \n\n In 1985, under the direction of coach Rollie Massimino, the men's basketball team completed one of the most surprising runs in NCAA tournament history by winning the national championship in the first year of the 64-team field.

Such high voltage systems have been used in locations where small diameter wire is already in place, where long-distance wire runs are involved and at especially loud installations such as Daytona International Speedway and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway prior to its redesign in 2003. Safety considerations in such high voltages require speaker line installation within conduit in most of the world. 600 watt transformers are widely available for contractors needing high power loudspeakers in constant-voltage installations. Special-purpose transformers capable of handling 1250 watts down as low as 50 Hz are available. One problem with high power, high current transformers is that fewer can be used on a single constant-voltage line. Larger diameter speaker wire is recommended. Larger transformers needed for high power handling have reduced high-frequency response.\n\n  A pulse transformer is a transformer that is optimised for transmitting rectangular electrical pulses (that is, pulses with fast rise and fall times and a relatively constant amplitude). Small versions called signal types are used in digital logic and telecommunications circuits such as in Ethernet, often for matching logic drivers to transmission lines. These are also called Ethernet transformer modules. Medium-sized power versions are used in power-control circuits such as camera flash controllers. Larger power versions are used in the electrical power distribution industry to interface low-voltage control circuitry to the high-voltage gates of power semiconductors. Special high voltage pulse transformers are also used to generate high power pulses for radar, particle accelerators, or other high energy pulsed power applications. To minimize distortion of the pulse shape, a pulse transformer needs to have low values of leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high \n\n Isolation transformers are also used for the power supply of devices not at ground potential. An example is the Austin transformer for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle warning lamps on radio antenna masts. Without the isolation transformer, the lighting circuits on the mast would conduct radio-frequency energy to ground through the power supply.\n\n These consisted of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed the direction of the current on the negative half cycles. They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.\n\nQuestion: two examples where low voltage transformers are used\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical. In the countries bordering the Mediterranean, there are groves of orange and olive trees, evergreen oaks, cork trees and pines, intermixed with cypresses, myrtles, arbutus and fragrant tree-heaths. South of the Atlas Range the conditions alter. The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness. Characteristic of the Sahara is the date palm, which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, \n\n Sudan is the geographic region to the south of the Sahara, stretching from Western to eastern Central Africa. The name derives from the Arabic bilād as-sūdān (بلاد السودان), or \"the lands of the Blacks\", referring to West Africa and northern Central Africa. The Arabic name was translated as Negroland on older English maps. Historically, the name was understood to denote the western part of the Sahel region. It thus roughly encompassed the geographical belt between the Sahara and the coastal West Africa. In modern usage, the term \"Sudan\" is also used in a separate context to refer specifically to the geographic region comprising the present-day countries of the Sudan, including its western region which forms a part of the country, and South Sudan, which gained its independence in 2011. In order to avoid confusion, the term \"the Sudans\" is becoming the preferred option when describing this region.\n\n Trans-Saharan trade requires travel across the Sahara between sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. While existing from prehistoric times, the peak of trade extended from the 8th century until the early 17th century. The Sahara once had a very different environment. In Libya and Algeria, from at least 7000 BC, there was pastoralism, the herding of sheep, goats, large settlements, and pottery. Cattle were introduced to the Central Sahara (Ahaggar) from 4000 to 3500 BC. Remarkable rock paintings (dated 3500 to 2500 BC) in places that are currently very dry, portray flora and fauna that are not present in the modern desert environment. As a desert, Sahara is now a hostile expanse \n\n south of desert is the plains region known as the Sahel. The arid region, the Sahara — the largest hot desert in the world, covering 9000000 km2 — extends from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Though generally of slight elevation, it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to 2400 m Bordered N.W. by the Atlas range, to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the Mediterranean; this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the Nile. That river (see below) pierces the desert without modifying its character. The Atlas range, the north-westerly part of the continent, between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places 160 km broad. From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara. The greater part of that now desert region is, indeed, furrowed by old water-channels.\n\n Sahara has served as a trans-regional zone for peoples in Africa. Authors from various countries (e.g., Algeria, Cameroon, Sudan) in Africa have critiqued the conceptualization of the Sahara as a regional barrier, and provided counter-arguments supporting the interconnectedness of continental Africa; there are historic and cultural connections as well as trade between West Africa, North Africa, and East Africa (e.g., North Africa with Niger and Mali, North Africa with Tanzania and Sudan, major hubs of Islamic learning in Niger and Mali). Africa has been conceptually compartmentalized into meaning \"Black Africa\", \"Africa South of the Sahara\", and \"Sub-Saharan Africa.\" North Africa \n\nQuestion: what is the significance of the sahara desert\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If recurrent, the interval during which the lips are enlarged may be weeks or months. The enlargement can cause midline fissuring of the lip (\"median cheilitis\") or angular cheilitis (sores at the corner of the mouth). The swelling is non-pitting (c.f. pitting edema) and feels soft or rubbery on palpation. The mucous membrane of the lip may be erythematous (red) and granular. One or both lips may be affected. ; Oral ulceration (mouth ulcers) which may be aphthous like, or be more chronic and deep with raised margins. Alternatively, lesions similar to pyostomatitis vegetans may occur in OFG, but this is uncommon. ; \"Full width\" gingivitis (compare with marginal gingivitis). ; Gingival enlargement (swelling of the gums). ; Fissured tongue (grooves in the tongue). ; Enlargement of \n\nAngular cheilitis (AC) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. It can also be itchy or painful. The condition can last for days to years. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips).\n\nAngular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. aureus. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Often a number of factors are involved. Other factors may include poor nutrition or poor immune function. Diagnosis may be helped by testing for infections and patch testing for allergies.\n\nTreatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. Frequently an antifungal and antibacterial cream is also tried. Angular cheilitis is a fairly common problem, with estimates that it affects 0.7% of the population. It occurs most often in people in their 30s to 60s, and is also relatively common in children. In the developing world, iron and vitamin deficiencies are a common cause.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAngular cheilitis is a fairly non specific term which describes the presence of an inflammatory lesion in a particular anatomic site (i.e. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. There is not usually any bleeding. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts. In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.\n\nSometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. Typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness, pain, pruritus (itching) or burning or a raw feeling.\n\nCauses \nAngular cheilitis is thought to be multifactorial disorder of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in angular cheilitis are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. Some studies have linked the initial onset of angular cheilitis with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B(B2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. Angular cheilitis can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic.\n\nInfection\n\nThe involved organisms are:\n\n Candida species alone (usually Candida albicans), which accounts for about 20% of cases, \n Bacterial species, either:\n Staphylococcus aureus alone, which accounts for about 20% of cases, \n β-hemolytic streptococci alone. These types of bacteria have been detected in between 8–15% of cases of angular cheilitis, but less commonly are they present in isolation, \n Or a combination of the above organisms, (a polymicrobial infection) with about 60% of cases involving both C. albicans and S. aureus.\n\nCandida can be detected in 93% of angular cheilitis lesions. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. However, Candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by Candida. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing.\n\nA lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. This is herpes labialis (a cold sore), and is sometimes termed \"angular herpes simplex\". A cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7–10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a cold sore, with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir.\n\nIrritation contact dermatitis\n\n \n22% of cases of angular cheilitis are due to irritants. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. The corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva more than any other part of the lips. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth.  Angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers. Angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.\n\nHabits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it perlèche (derived from the French word pourlècher meaning \"to lick one’s lips\"), or \"factitious cheilitis\" is applied to this habit. The term \"cheilocandidiasis\" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.\n\nThe sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. Because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms.\n\nNutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes AC, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause AC, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). Vitamin B5 deficiency may also cause AC, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for AC, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency has also been reported to cause AC, along with hair loss (alopecia) and dry eyes. Zinc deficiency is known to cause AC. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with AC.\n\nIn general, these nutritional disorders may be caused by malnutrition, such as may occur in alcoholism or in poorly considered diets, or by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease).\n\nSystemic disorders\nSome systemic disorders are involved in angular cheilitis by virtue of their association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa.  Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer–Vinson syndrome or Paterson–Brown–Kelly syndrome).\n\nDrugs\nSeveral drugs may cause AC as a side effect, by various mechanisms, such as creating drug-induced xerostomia. Various examples include isotretinoin, indinavir, and sorafenib. Isotretinoin (Accutane), an analog of vitamin A, is a medication which dries the skin. Less commonly, angular cheilitis is associated with primary hypervitaminosis A, which can occur when large amounts of liver (including cod liver oil and other fish oils) are regularly consumed or as a result from an excess intake of vitamin A in the form of vitamin supplements. Recreational drug users may develop AC. Examples include cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and hallucinogens.\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone.\n\nExamples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. It is usually impossible to tell the difference between irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis without a patch test.\n\nLoss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. This can be corrected with onlays or crowns on the worn teeth to restore height or new dentures with \"taller\" teeth. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAngular cheilitis is normally a diagnosis made clinically. If the sore is unilateral, rather than bilateral, this suggests a local factor (e.g., trauma) or a split syphilitic papule. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral.\n\nThe lesions are normally swabbed to detect if Candida or pathogenic bacterial species may be present. Persons with angular cheilitis who wear dentures often also will have their denture swabbed in addition. A complete blood count (full blood count) may be indicated, including assessment of the levels of iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 (and possibly other B vitamins), and folate.\n\nClassification\nAngular cheilitis could be considered to be a type of cheilitis or stomatitis. Where Candida species are involved, angular cheilitis is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group I) Candida-associated lesion. This form angular cheilitis which is caused by Candida is sometimes termed \"Candida-associated angular cheilitis\", or less commonly, \"monilial perlèche\". Angular cheilitis can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).\n\nManagement\nThere are four aspects to the treatment of angular cheilitis. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. This involves having dentures properly fitted and disinfected. Commercial preparations are marketed for this purpose, although dentures may be left in dilute (1:10 concentration) household bleach overnight, but only if they are entirely plastic and do not contain any metal parts, and with rinsing under clean water before use. Improved denture hygiene is often required thereafter, including not wearing the denture during sleep and cleaning it daily. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis.\n\nSecondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. This may require the construction of a new denture with an adjusted bite. Rarely, in cases resistant to normal treatments, surgical procedures such as collagen injections (or other facial fillers such as autologous fat or crosslinked hyaluronic acid) are used in an attempt to restore the normal facial contour. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. zinc oxide paste) at night.\n\nThirdly, treatment of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. This is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. Some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. Diiodohydroxyquinoline is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. If Staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. Aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, mupirocin, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario.\n\nFinally, if the condition appears resistant to treatment, investigations for underlying causes such as anemia or nutrient deficiencies or HIV infection. Identification of the underlying cause is essential for treating chronic cases. The lesions may resolve when the underlying disease is treated, e.g. with a course of oral iron or B vitamin supplements. Patch testing is recommended by some in cases which are resistant to treatment and where allergic contact dermatitis is suspected.\n\nPrognosis\nMost cases of angular cheilitis respond quickly when antifungal treatment is used. In more long standing cases, the severity of the condition often follows a relapsing and remitting course over time. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged.\n\nEpidemiology\nAC is a relatively common condition, accounting for between 0.7 – 3.8% of oral mucosal lesions in adults and between 0.2 – 15.1% in children, though overall it occurs most commonly in adults in the third to sixth decades of life. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Angular cheilitis is the most common presentation of fungal and bacterial infections of the lips.\n\nEtymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nLip disorders\nConditions of the mucous membranes\nMycosis-related cutaneous conditions\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\n\nAngular cheilitis (AC) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth.

Angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers. Angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.\n\nHabits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it perlèche (derived from the French word pourlècher meaning \"to lick one’s lips\"), or \"factitious cheilitis\" is applied to this habit. The term \"cheilocandidiasis\" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.\n\nThe sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. Because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms.\n\nNutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes AC, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause AC, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). Vitamin B5 deficiency may also cause AC, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for AC, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency has also been reported to cause AC, along with hair loss (alopecia) and dry eyes. Zinc deficiency is known to cause AC. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with AC.\n\nIn general, these nutritional disorders may be caused by malnutrition, such as may occur in alcoholism or in poorly considered diets, or by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease).\n\nSystemic disorders\nSome systemic disorders are involved in angular cheilitis by virtue of their association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa.  Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer–Vinson syndrome or Paterson–Brown–Kelly syndrome).\n\nDrugs\nSeveral drugs may cause AC as a side effect, by various mechanisms, such as creating drug-induced xerostomia. Various examples include isotretinoin, indinavir, and sorafenib. Isotretinoin (Accutane), an analog of vitamin A, is a medication which dries the skin. Less commonly, angular cheilitis is associated with primary hypervitaminosis A, which can occur when large amounts of liver (including cod liver oil and other fish oils) are regularly consumed or as a result from an excess intake of vitamin A in the form of vitamin supplements. Recreational drug users may develop AC. Examples include cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and hallucinogens.\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone.\n\nExamples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. It is usually impossible to tell the difference between irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis without a patch test.\n\nLoss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. This can be corrected with onlays or crowns on the worn teeth to restore height or new dentures with \"taller\" teeth. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAngular cheilitis is normally a diagnosis made clinically. If the sore is unilateral, rather than bilateral, this suggests a local factor (e.g., trauma) or a split syphilitic papule. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral.\n\nThe lesions are normally swabbed to detect if Candida or pathogenic bacterial species may be present. Persons with angular cheilitis who wear dentures often also will have their denture swabbed in addition. A complete blood count (full blood count) may be indicated, including assessment of the levels of iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 (and possibly other B vitamins), and folate.\n\nClassification\nAngular cheilitis could be considered to be a type of cheilitis or stomatitis. Where Candida species are involved, angular cheilitis is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group I) Candida-associated lesion. This form angular cheilitis which is caused by Candida is sometimes termed \"Candida-associated angular cheilitis\", or less commonly, \"monilial perlèche\". Angular cheilitis can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).\n\nManagement\nThere are four aspects to the treatment of angular cheilitis. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. This involves having dentures properly fitted and disinfected. Commercial preparations are marketed for this purpose, although dentures may be left in dilute (1:10 concentration) household bleach overnight, but only if they are entirely plastic and do not contain any metal parts, and with rinsing under clean water before use. Improved denture hygiene is often required thereafter, including not wearing the denture during sleep and cleaning it daily. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis.\n\nSecondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. This may require the construction of a new denture with an adjusted bite. Rarely, in cases resistant to normal treatments, surgical procedures such as collagen injections (or other facial fillers such as autologous fat or crosslinked hyaluronic acid) are used in an attempt to restore the normal facial contour. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. zinc oxide paste) at night.\n\nThirdly, treatment of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. This is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. Some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. Diiodohydroxyquinoline is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. If Staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. Aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, mupirocin, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario.\n\nFinally, if the condition appears resistant to treatment, investigations for underlying causes such as anemia or nutrient deficiencies or HIV infection. Identification of the underlying cause is essential for treating chronic cases. The lesions may resolve when the underlying disease is treated, e.g. with a course of oral iron or B vitamin supplements. Patch testing is recommended by some in cases which are resistant to treatment and where allergic contact dermatitis is suspected.\n\nPrognosis\nMost cases of angular cheilitis respond quickly when antifungal treatment is used. In more long standing cases, the severity of the condition often follows a relapsing and remitting course over time. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged.\n\nEpidemiology\nAC is a relatively common condition, accounting for between 0.7 – 3.8% of oral mucosal lesions in adults and between 0.2 – 15.1% in children, though overall it occurs most commonly in adults in the third to sixth decades of life. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Angular cheilitis is the most common presentation of fungal and bacterial infections of the lips.\n\nEtymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nLip disorders\nConditions of the mucous membranes\nMycosis-related cutaneous conditions\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\n\nAngular cheilitis (AC) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. It can also be itchy or painful. The condition can last for days to years. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips).\n\nAngular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. aureus. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Often a number of factors are involved. Other factors may include poor nutrition or poor immune function. Diagnosis may be helped by testing for infections and patch testing for allergies.\n\nTreatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. Frequently an antifungal and antibacterial cream is also tried. Angular cheilitis is a fairly common problem, with estimates that it affects 0.7% of the population. It occurs most often in people in their 30s to 60s, and is also relatively common in children. In the developing world, iron and vitamin deficiencies are a common cause.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nAngular cheilitis is a fairly non specific term which describes the presence of an inflammatory lesion in a particular anatomic site (i.e. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. In some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. There is not usually any bleeding. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. If Staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts. In chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.\n\nSometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. Typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness, pain, pruritus (itching) or burning or a raw feeling.\n\nCauses \nAngular cheilitis is thought to be multifactorial disorder of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in angular cheilitis are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. Some studies have linked the initial onset of angular cheilitis with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B(B2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. Angular cheilitis can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic.\n\nInfection\n\nThe involved organisms are:\n\n Candida species alone (usually Candida albicans), which accounts for about 20% of cases, \n Bacterial species, either:\n Staphylococcus aureus alone, which accounts for about 20% of cases, \n β-hemolytic streptococci alone. These types of bacteria have been detected in between 8–15% of cases of angular cheilitis, but less commonly are they present in isolation, \n Or a combination of the above organisms, (a polymicrobial infection) with about 60% of cases involving both C. albicans and S. aureus.\n\nCandida can be detected in 93% of angular cheilitis lesions. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. However, Candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by Candida. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing.\n\nA lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. This is herpes labialis (a cold sore), and is sometimes termed \"angular herpes simplex\". A cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7–10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a cold sore, with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir.\n\nIrritation contact dermatitis\n\n \n22% of cases of angular cheilitis are due to irritants. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. The corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva more than any other part of the lips. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth.  Angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers. Angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.\n\nHabits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it perlèche (derived from the French word pourlècher meaning \"to lick one’s lips\"), or \"factitious cheilitis\" is applied to this habit. The term \"cheilocandidiasis\" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.\n\nThe sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. Because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms.\n\nNutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes AC, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause AC, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). Vitamin B5 deficiency may also cause AC, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for AC, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency has also been reported to cause AC, along with hair loss (alopecia) and dry eyes. Zinc deficiency is known to cause AC. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with AC.\n\nIn general, these nutritional disorders may be caused by malnutrition, such as may occur in alcoholism or in poorly considered diets, or by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease).\n\nSystemic disorders\nSome systemic disorders are involved in angular cheilitis by virtue of their association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above.

Typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness, pain, pruritus (itching) or burning or a raw feeling.\n\nCauses \nAngular cheilitis is thought to be multifactorial disorder of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. The sores in angular cheilitis are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. Some studies have linked the initial onset of angular cheilitis with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the B(B2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. Angular cheilitis can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic.\n\nInfection\n\nThe involved organisms are:\n\n Candida species alone (usually Candida albicans), which accounts for about 20% of cases, \n Bacterial species, either:\n Staphylococcus aureus alone, which accounts for about 20% of cases, \n β-hemolytic streptococci alone. These types of bacteria have been detected in between 8–15% of cases of angular cheilitis, but less commonly are they present in isolation, \n Or a combination of the above organisms, (a polymicrobial infection) with about 60% of cases involving both C. albicans and S. aureus.\n\nCandida can be detected in 93% of angular cheilitis lesions. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. However, Candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. Potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by Candida. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing.\n\nA lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. This is herpes labialis (a cold sore), and is sometimes termed \"angular herpes simplex\". A cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7–10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a cold sore, with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir.\n\nIrritation contact dermatitis\n\n \n22% of cases of angular cheilitis are due to irritants. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. The corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva more than any other part of the lips. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. The tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth.  Angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers. Angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. It is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.\n\nHabits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it perlèche (derived from the French word pourlècher meaning \"to lick one’s lips\"), or \"factitious cheilitis\" is applied to this habit. The term \"cheilocandidiasis\" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.\n\nThe sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. Using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. Because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms.\n\nNutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes AC, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause AC, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). Vitamin B5 deficiency may also cause AC, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for AC, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency has also been reported to cause AC, along with hair loss (alopecia) and dry eyes. Zinc deficiency is known to cause AC. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with AC.\n\nIn general, these nutritional disorders may be caused by malnutrition, such as may occur in alcoholism or in poorly considered diets, or by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease).\n\nSystemic disorders\nSome systemic disorders are involved in angular cheilitis by virtue of their association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. Such examples include people with anorexia nervosa.  Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. More still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like Candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. About 25% of people with Down syndrome appear to have AC. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. Inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called Plummer–Vinson syndrome or Paterson–Brown–Kelly syndrome).\n\nDrugs\nSeveral drugs may cause AC as a side effect, by various mechanisms, such as creating drug-induced xerostomia. Various examples include isotretinoin, indinavir, and sorafenib. Isotretinoin (Accutane), an analog of vitamin A, is a medication which dries the skin. Less commonly, angular cheilitis is associated with primary hypervitaminosis A, which can occur when large amounts of liver (including cod liver oil and other fish oils) are regularly consumed or as a result from an excess intake of vitamin A in the form of vitamin supplements. Recreational drug users may develop AC. Examples include cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and hallucinogens.\n\nAllergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone.\n\nExamples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. It is usually impossible to tell the difference between irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis without a patch test.\n\nLoss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. This can be corrected with onlays or crowns on the worn teeth to restore height or new dentures with \"taller\" teeth. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAngular cheilitis is normally a diagnosis made clinically. If the sore is unilateral, rather than bilateral, this suggests a local factor (e.g., trauma) or a split syphilitic papule. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral.\n\nThe lesions are normally swabbed to detect if Candida or pathogenic bacterial species may be present. Persons with angular cheilitis who wear dentures often also will have their denture swabbed in addition. A complete blood count (full blood count) may be indicated, including assessment of the levels of iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 (and possibly other B vitamins), and folate.\n\nClassification\nAngular cheilitis could be considered to be a type of cheilitis or stomatitis. Where Candida species are involved, angular cheilitis is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group I) Candida-associated lesion. This form angular cheilitis which is caused by Candida is sometimes termed \"Candida-associated angular cheilitis\", or less commonly, \"monilial perlèche\". Angular cheilitis can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).\n\nManagement\nThere are four aspects to the treatment of angular cheilitis. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. This involves having dentures properly fitted and disinfected. Commercial preparations are marketed for this purpose, although dentures may be left in dilute (1:10 concentration) household bleach overnight, but only if they are entirely plastic and do not contain any metal parts, and with rinsing under clean water before use. Improved denture hygiene is often required thereafter, including not wearing the denture during sleep and cleaning it daily. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis.\n\nSecondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. This may require the construction of a new denture with an adjusted bite. Rarely, in cases resistant to normal treatments, surgical procedures such as collagen injections (or other facial fillers such as autologous fat or crosslinked hyaluronic acid) are used in an attempt to restore the normal facial contour. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. zinc oxide paste) at night.\n\nThirdly, treatment of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. This is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. Some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. Diiodohydroxyquinoline is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. If Staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. Aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, mupirocin, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario.\n\nFinally, if the condition appears resistant to treatment, investigations for underlying causes such as anemia or nutrient deficiencies or HIV infection. Identification of the underlying cause is essential for treating chronic cases. The lesions may resolve when the underlying disease is treated, e.g. with a course of oral iron or B vitamin supplements. Patch testing is recommended by some in cases which are resistant to treatment and where allergic contact dermatitis is suspected.\n\nPrognosis\nMost cases of angular cheilitis respond quickly when antifungal treatment is used. In more long standing cases, the severity of the condition often follows a relapsing and remitting course over time. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged.\n\nEpidemiology\nAC is a relatively common condition, accounting for between 0.7 – 3.8% of oral mucosal lesions in adults and between 0.2 – 15.1% in children, though overall it occurs most commonly in adults in the third to sixth decades of life. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Angular cheilitis is the most common presentation of fungal and bacterial infections of the lips.\n\nEtymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nLip disorders\nConditions of the mucous membranes\nMycosis-related cutaneous conditions\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\n\nQuestion: what causes cracked skin at the corners of your mouth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Gomes claims he was accompanied by Jacob, an \"Indian\" interpreter, which some early historians have taken as a rare indication that Henry envisaged reaching India at this early stage. However, modern historians find this improbable; Russell notes that, at the time, 'Indian' was commonly used as a moniker for an Ethiopian, and the furthest hope that Henry nurtured was of reaching the lands of Prester John. Gomes is said to have reached as far as Rio Grande (now Geba River, in Guinea Bissau), a huge leap beyond the last point known to be reached by the Portuguese. But \n\n The Portuguese were the first Europeans to explore the region of current-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique by sea. Vasco da Gama visited Mombasa in 1498. Da Gama's voyage was successful in reaching India, which permitted the Portuguese to trade with the Far East directly by sea. This in turn challenged the older trading networks of mixed land and sea routes, such as the spice trade routes which utilized the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and camel caravans to reach the eastern Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice had gained control over much of the trade routes between Europe and Asia. After traditional land routes to India had \n\n not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.  More than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached Kilwa, the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim. A meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King \n\n Long after the decline of the Roman Empire's sea-borne trade with India, the Portuguese were the next Europeans to sail there for the purpose of trade, first arriving by ship in May 1498. The closing of the traditional trade routes in western Asia by the Ottoman Empire, and rivalry with the Italian states sent Portugal in search of an alternate sea route to India. The first successful voyage to India was by Vasco da Gama in 1498, when after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope he arrived in Calicut, now in Kerala. Having arrived there, he obtained from Saamoothiri Rajah \n\n The Portuguese mariner Bartolomeu Dias was the first European to explore the coastline of South Africa in 1488, while attempting to discover a trade route to the Far East via the southernmost cape of South Africa, which he named Cabo das Tormentas, meaning Cape of Storms. In November 1497, a fleet of Portuguese ships under the command of the Portuguese mariner Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope. By 16 December, the fleet had passed the Great Fish River on the east coast of South Africa, where Dias had earlier turned back. Da Gama gave the name Natal to the coast he was passing, which in Portuguese means Christmas. Da Gama's fleet proceeded northwards to Zanzibar and later sailed eastwards, eventually reaching India and opening the Cape Route between Europe and Asia.\n\nQuestion: who captained the first european ship to sail around the tip of africa\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The structure is crowned with a blue dome and it is popularly known as the Neeli (\"Blue\") chhatri. The construction was influenced by Central Asian architecture, which consists of alternating wide and narrow sides. Entrances have been built into the wider sides, while the narrower sides are ornamented in a pattern of incised plaster, paint or glazed tile. The tomb does not have any markings pointing to the identity of those buried under it. However, it is of immense significance due to the ceiling on its double dome structure painted in pure gold and lapiz and revealed after conservation efforts began. It is thought to be the earliest surviving painted ceiling for any monument in India.\n\n  Darbazi (დარბაზი; from, \"gate\") is a term used in Georgia to describe a chamber with a distinctive \"swallow dome\"-type roof structure found in the traditional domestic architecture of Asia Minor and the South Caucasus. The central feature is a pyramidal vault (gvirgvini), supported on pillars and constructed of a stepped series of hewn logs and beams, with a central opening at the top which serves as a window and smoke flue. The Roman authority Vitruvius (1st century BC) includes in his De architectura a description of a Colchian dwelling, the ancient prototype of a darbazi. Such lantern roofs are called harazashen or glkhatun \n\n   A conventional slate roof consists of thin slates, hung over wooden laths. Slates are hung in place by wooden pegs through a hole at the top of each slate. The peg stops the slate slipping downwards, the weight of the slates above it hold the slate down. Later roofs replaced the peg by an iron nail driven into the lath, but the nail is always primarily a hook and it is the weight of the slates above that hold the roof covering down onto the frame. Lead nails were also used, long enough to be bent over the laths from the inside. In time these developed \n\n The houses around the green are mostly Georgian with some rubble-built houses on the north and south sides of the green. When they were built, the rubble-built houses would have been rendered, but the present fashion is to reveal the stonework with the rendering removed. Roofs are mostly red pantiles, and tend to be finished with a line of split-stone along the eaves. Some of the larger buildings have blue slate roofs, the slate probably brought by the railway. The older cottages in the village have steep pitched roofs in a style that suggests earlier heather thatching.\n\n Buildings in Chamba were traditionally constructed using local materials. Buildings were made out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before the arrival of the British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.

Digestion involves both mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. Enzymatic hydrolysis is initiated by intraluminal processes requiring gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Malabsorption constitutes the pathological interference with the normal physiological sequence of digestion (intraluminal process), absorption (mucosal process) and transport (postmucosal events) of nutrients. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\nThe end-product of the action of salivary amylase is maltose. Salivary amylase is an enzyme present in saliva that plays a crucial role in the digestion of carbohydrates. It breaks down starch molecules into smaller fragments by cleaving the glycosidic bonds between glucose units. Specifically, salivary amylase hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, resulting in the production of maltose. Maltose consists of two glucose units linked together by an α-1,4-glycosidic bond. Although salivary amylase initiates carbohydrate digestion in the mouth, the process continues in the small intestine where pancreatic amylase further breaks down starch into maltose and other maltodextrins.\n\nThe digestion of carbohydrates involves the action of two types of enzymes: salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase. Salivary amylase is secreted by the salivary glands and begins the process of carbohydrate digestion in the mouth. It breaks down complex carbohydrates, such as starch, into shorter chains called oligosaccharides. \n\nPancreatic amylase is produced by the pancreas and is released into the small intestine. It continues the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down the oligosaccharides into smaller units called disaccharides, such as maltose and sucrose. \n\nThe classification of these enzymes falls under the categories of peptidases and disaccharidases. Peptidases are enzymes that break down peptides, while disaccharidases are responsible for the further breakdown of disaccharides into monosaccharides. \n\nAdditionally, the plasma membrane of the apical microvilli in the small intestine contains the enzyme enteropeptidase (enterokinase), which plays a crucial role in the activation of pancreatic enzymes. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen into trypsin, which in turn activates other pancreatic enzymes.\n\nOverall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides.\n\nIn the Mouth: Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth by saliva. Saliva begins digestion of carbohydrate in the mouth through action of salivary amylase, an enzyme that breaks polysaccharides down into maltose, a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules. Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. However, most of the digestion by this enzyme is accomplished in the body of the stomach after the food mass and saliva have been swallowed. Acid inactivates amylase, but in the center of the food mass, where stomach acid has not yet reached, this salivary enzyme continues to function for several more hours.\nIn the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. Acid and pepsin are able to attack only the surface of the food mass. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. Even though acid inactivates salivary amylase, the unmixed interior of the food mass is free acid.\nIn the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. Pancreatic amylase, like salivary amylase, contributes to carbohydrate digestion by converting polysaccharides into disaccharides.\nCarbohydrate digestion in the small intestine finishes converting digestible polysaccharides and disaccharides into monosaccharides into monosaccharides that can be absorbed. Pancreatic amylase continues to digest starch into maltose.\nBecause of pancreatic enzymatic activity, carbohydrates are reduced to disaccharides and some monosaccharides. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Special actin-stiffened, hair-like projections on the luminal surface of the small intestine epithelial cells form the brush border. The brush-border plasma membrane contains, in addition to other enzymes, the disaccharidases (maltase, sucrase, and lactase), which complete carbohydrate digestion by hydrolyzing the remaining disaccharides (maltose, sucrose, and lactose, respectively) into their constituent monosaccharides. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border.\nCarbohydrate Absorption: Dietary carbohydrate is presented to the small intestine for absorption mainly in the forms of the disaccharides maltose (the product of polysaccharide digestion), sucrose and lactose.\nThe disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose.\nGlucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell. The operation of these cotransport carriers, which do not directly use energy themselves, depends o the Na+ concentration gradient established by the energy-consuming basolateral Na+-K+ pump. Glucose (or galactose), having been concentrated in the cell by the cotransport carriers, leaves the cell down its concentration gradient by means of a passive carrier in the basolateral border to enter the blood within the villus. In addition to glucose being absorbed through the cells by means of a cotransport carrier. Fructose is absorbed into the blood solely by facilitated diffusion (passive carrier-mediated transport).\nGI Physiology Carbohydrates Digestion and Absorption. permalink.\n\nThe purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This process allows organisms to extract the necessary nutrients from food for energy and essential biological functions.\n\nDigestion can be divided into two processes: mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion involves the physical breakdown of food into smaller pieces. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. These enzymes act on specific nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, converting them into forms that the body can utilize.\n\nIn the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. It also contains mucus for lubrication, hydrogen carbonate for ideal pH conditions, and electrolytes.\n\nAfter chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis. In the stomach, gastric juice plays a crucial role in digestion. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which initiate protein digestion. Additionally, in infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin for milk protein digestion.\n\nTo protect the stomach wall from the potentially damaging effects of gastric juice, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted, forming a slimy layer as a shield.\n\nOverall, digestion allows organisms to break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used by the body to sustain life and perform essential functions.\n\nQuestion: in what part of the digestive tube do you expect the initial digestion of starch\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, knowing the difference between rales, a crackle, and a wheeze is sometimes still a confusing proposition for many nurses, especially new nurses.\nPart of the reason for that is that some of the language is interchangeable. For instance, crackles actually are rales, and the large amount of words can leave anyone’s head spinning. Knowing what to call what you hear on the other end of the stethoscope can tell you – and the doctor – quite a bit about a patient’s condition.\nWhat was once called rhonchi are now called a sonorous wheeze, and this is because they have a snoring, gurgling quality to them. Rhonchi are often a low-pitched moan that is more prominent on exhalation. It differs from wheezes in that wheezes are high and squeaky while these are low and dull. Rhonchi are caused by blockages to the main airways by mucous, lesions, or foreign bodies. Pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis are patient populations that commonly present with rhonchi. Coughing can sometimes clear this breath sound and make it change to a different sound.\nCrackles are the sounds you will hear in a lung field that has fluid in the small airways. As stated before, crackles and rales are the same thing, and this can often lead to confusion among health care providers. Crackles come in two flavours: fine and coarse. Fine crackles sound like salt heated on a frying pan or the sound of rolling your hair between your fingers next to your ear. Coarse crackles sound like pouring water out of a bottle or like ripping open Velcro. This lung sound is often a sign of adult respiratory distress syndrome, early congestive heart failure, asthma, and pulmonary oedema.\nRhonchi, rales, wheezes, rubbing or stridor? – Listening for lung sounds.\nWheezes and rhonchi are actually very closely related. They are so closely related that the terminology for them has changed, too. Wheezes are now known as sibilant wheezes to distinguish them from rhonchi. Sibilant wheezes are high-pitched and shrill sounding breath sounds that occur when the airway becomes narrowed. They often have a musical quality to them. These are the typical wheezes heard when listening to an asthmatic patient. Sibilant wheezes are caused by asthma, congestive heart failure, chronic bronchitis, and COPD (see ‘Understanding COPD and the Hypoxic Drive to Breathe‘).\nStridor is an unusual sound that not many adult patients will have, but it bears mentioning. It is a high-pitched, musical sound that is heard over the upper airway. It usually indicated a foreign body obstruction of the larger airways, such as the trachea or a main bronchus, and requires immediate attention. It is also the most common type of breath sound heard in children with croup, though it is important to differentiate between croup and a foreign body airway obstruction.\nA pleural friction rub is caused by the inflammation of the visceral and parietal pleurae. These membranes are usually coated in a protective fluid, but when inflamed, they stick together and make a sound like leather creaking against itself. It often causes a great deal of pain, and the patient will splint their chest and resist breathing deeply to help mitigate the pain. A pericardial rub and a pleural rub will often sound similar, and the best way to distinguish between the two is to make the patient hold their breath. If you still hear the rubbing sound, then the patient has a pericardial rub and requires different treatment. Pleural effusion and pneumothorax are two diagnoses that can cause a pleural friction rub.\nDepending on your specialty, your cardiac assessment probably consists of listening to an apical pulse over the mitral valve and sagely nodding your head.\nInstead of settling for good old “lub-dub,” put that stethoscope to greater use and reacquaint yourself with the sound of the heart.\nOkay, let’s make this simple. We are going to listen to the heart over the valves, and nothing more. No Erb’s point or anything esoteric. It just doesn’t matter in your everyday assessment. Now, if you hear a murmur over the valve… we are getting somewhere.\nYou know there are four valves in your heart: aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral. It helps to think of them in this order. They make a sort of elongated “z” on the chest, with the aortic valve starting at the top right, two intercostal spaces down at the sternal border.\nThe pulmonic valve is easy enough to find. It’s right across the sternum at the left sternal border.\nTo find the tricuspid valve area, stay on the left side and count down four intercostal spaces.\nThe mitral valve is relatively easy to find if you are used to taking an apical pulse. If not, go to the fifth intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line.\nNow that you know where to put your stethoscope, you have to make sense of what you are listening to. The first sound you hear in the cardiac cycle is the “lub,” and it is a sound full of meaning.\n“Lub” means that the heart is in systole, or the ejection phase of the heart. It is the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing as the body empties the ventricles into the lungs and body. It is also known as S1.\n“Dub,” or S2, is the beginning of diastole, or the relaxation phase of the heart. It is the sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing. During this time, the ventricles fill and the atria contract.\nOccasionally, you may hear a “split” S2 that sounds like “du-dub.” This is the aortic valve closing slightly before the pulmonic valve and is often a normal sound heard on inspiration. You can have a split S1, too, which is when the mitral valve closes before the pulmonic valve, and it can sometime indicate a bundle branch block. It is important to listen closely to hear when the sounds split.\nThis is where most people’s eyes start to glaze over, but it is where you can learn something useful to your patient. You will need to listen to the heart with the bell of your stethoscope to hear the abnormal heart sounds.\nTo hear a ventricular gallop, or S3, you should listen over the mitral valve with the bell. It will sound like a weird plopping noise right after you hear the “dub.” The whole heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Kentucky’. This heart sound can indicate heart ischaemia or heart failure. The ventricles are stiffening and resisting the influx of blood in diastole. However, it is a normal sound in young adults under 30.\nS4 is the heart sound for atrial gallop, and the heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Tennessee’. Listen over the mitral valve with the bell of the stethoscope. You will hear the plopping noise just before the “lub” starts, which means it happens right before systole starts. This heart sound can tell you quite a bit. It is heard after heart attacks, and can indicate aortic stenosis, ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension.\nHeart murmurs are the other heart sounds you will hear if you listen to enough hearts. They will often sound like the words “rush” or “hush” and can last throughout the heartbeat.\nThe above sample is of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) holosystolic heart murmur, caused by a opening in the dividing walls of the left and right heart ventricles.\nOther murmurs can be caused by stiff and narrowed valves that cannot tolerate the rapid flow of blood through them. Many people walk around with a murmur and have no problems with it, but it can indicate something serious if it starts suddenly. A sudden onset murmur can indicate heart failure, shock, or a ruptured papillary muscle. Murmurs can also indicate ischaemia, infection, medicine toxicity, and genetic disease, in some cases.\nMany cardiologists and cardiac nurses can pinpoint which valve the murmur comes from, when in the heart cycle it starts, and what grade the murmur rates. For those who are not so specialised, identifying that a murmur is present and calling it to the attention of the physician is likely all you need.\nPut Your Skills to the Test – Complete the Clinical Detective Video Course Here!\nMost nurses carry out a cursory listen for bowel sounds, but you may not realise how variable and important these sounds can be. As with most things learned at university, it is easy to forget the particulars once you are working on a nursing floor. Instead of really focusing on the sounds, you may simply write down what you think you hear.\nThis can be a problem because changes in bowel sounds can indicate problems with the patient long before other signs emerge. For instance, the absence of bowel sounds after a surgery can indicate an ileus before the patient starts vomiting or complaining of abdominal pain. For this reason, it is important to go over bowel sounds once more, pay closer attention to them, and not use them merely as a stepping stool to the next level of assessment. After reading this article, you may like to also review your knowledge of assessing constipation.\nThe abdomen can be divided into four quadrants. Although another system divides it into nine sections, the most common way to think of the abdomen is by drawing a line down the midline over the umbilicus and another across the abdomen bisecting it at the same point. This will give you the standard right upper quadrant, right lower quadrant, left upper quadrant and left lower quadrant. You should know the structures within each area to help determine what the bowel sounds mean.\nIn the right upper quadrant, you will find the lower margin of the liver, the gallbladder, part of the large intestine and a few loops of the small intestine. The right lower quadrant contains the appendix, the connection between the large and small intestines and loops of bowel. The left upper quadrant contains the lower margin of the spleen, part of the pancreas and some of the stomach and duodenum. The left lower quadrant contains bowel loops and the descending colon. Knowing the structures under your stethoscope will help you determine the nature of the bowel sounds.\nA diagram outlining the four quadrants of the abdomen. RUQ: right upper quadrant; RLQ: right lower quadrant; LUQ: left upper quadrant; LLQ: left lower quadrant.\nAlthough you can listen for vascular sounds over the abdomen, such as abdominal aortic bruits, most of the time you are listening for the sounds of the bowels themselves. As peristalsis moves the chyme along the bowel tract, grumbling noises are heard indicating that the bowels are active. You should listen over all four quadrants, not simply in one place. In fact, several areas per quadrant would be ideal, especially in patients who have gastrointestinal (GI) issues.\nThe first item to listen for is the presence of bowel sounds. To chart an assessment finding of no bowel sounds, you need to listen over the quadrant for at least five minutes. You should also do your auscultation before palpation and percussion to avoid influencing bowel sounds. In most cases bowel sounds are present, but you need to categorise them. You should listen for the intensity of the sound – whether it is soft or strong. You should also listen for frequency. Hypoactive bowel sounds could indicate a problem, so if you are having trouble hearing them this is significant.\nHyperactive bowel sounds, on the other hand, may indicate stomach upset, cramping and anything that is increasing peristalsis. The location and pitch of the sounds are important as well. Hypoactive bowel sounds in the right upper quadrant could indicate a bowel obstruction there. The pitch is important, too, as it can indicate the strength of the peristalsis and point to a problem.\nAuscultating bowel sounds can allow you to pinpoint areas where an obstruction may have occurred. Finding no bowel sounds can mean an ileus, or an obstruction above that area of the intestine. Hypoactive bowel sounds are considered as one every three to five minutes, and this can indicate diarrhoea, anxiety, or gastroenteritis. Hyperactive bowel sounds are often found before a blockage. It is quite common to find one quadrant with hyperactive bowel sounds and one with none or hypoactive ones. This is because the intestine is attempting to clear the blockage with increased peristalsis.\nYou may also hear high-pitched sounds and rushing noises. Again, this is a sign that the intestine is attempting to deal with a blockage. It is important to chart the location, quality, intensity, and frequency of bowel sounds to document the GI system completely. Most nurses default to bowel sounds active in all four quadrants, but you need to be aware that this may not always be the case. A harried and hurried nurse may perform a quick assessment, but bowel sounds are a great indicator of the overall health of the patient. You need to listen for more than a few seconds and in several places to fully assess your client’s GI function.\nAlong with the chest, the abdomen is a major focus of assessment. While everyone knows to listen for bowel sounds, that isn’t the only way to assess this important part of the anatomy. You can inspect the area, palpate, and percuss. However, you should probably listen to bowel sounds before manipulating the stomach as this can cause changes in the way the sounds are heard.\nThe other three tools are important to fully assessing the abdomen, though many nurses skip these parts and proceed directly to bowel sounds. By slowing down assessment and giving the abdomen the time and attention it needs, nurses can notice problems that may get past even the most experienced doctors.\nWhen assessing the abdomen, inspection is often overlooked. Merely looking at the abdomen can tell you a great deal about the patient and their relative health.\nYou should first look for symmetry to make sure there are no masses or protrusions that make one side of the abdomen bigger than the other.\nThis short video provides a four-minute overview of things to remember when performing a nursing assessment of bowel function in a palliative care setting.\nYou should also look for pulsation or movements under the skin. In very thin people, you will be able to see the movements of peristalsis, but you may also be able to see abnormal pulses of the descending aorta. This is important information.\nYou may also want to compare the abdomen to the rest of the body. If the stomach is large and the legs are thin, you may want to consider ascites. Similarly, if the legs are swollen and deformed, that swelling may continue on into the abdomen. You should also inspect the skin of the area, looking for dry patches or puckering of the skin.\nIn some patients with oedema, the abdomen can resemble the surface of an orange, and this can tip you off to a fluid imbalance issue.\nPalpation or feeling the abdomen is nearly as important as listening for bowel sounds. Many nurses gloss over this assessment, merely pressing on the stomach half-heartedly and moving on. However, you should take the time to really feel the abdomen. One of the first problems you can find is masses in the gut. You need to use your hands thoroughly to inspect the entire surface of the abdomen, looking for any masses, bulges, protrusions, or abnormal spots in what should be soft tissue.\nOne of the problems with palpating the abdomen is eliciting a painful response from the patient. If they are complaining about abdominal pain and you deeply massage their abdomen, they are likely to squirm away from you. Still, it is important to feel the tissue for any abnormal signs.\nOne important part of palpation is guarding. You feel this when you attempt to palpate the abdomen but only feel resistance. This is because the patient is protecting their abdomen from pain, and it is a significant finding. Rebound tenderness is also important. You can find this by deeply palpating, removing your hands, and watching for a pain reaction. Either of these should be reported to the physician.\nPercussion isn’t used by any but the most advanced health professionals. In fact, physicians, nurse practitioners, and other nurses of advanced standing are probably the only ones to use this technique. There is good reason for this. Percussion of the abdomen can’t tell you nearly as much as the other forms of assessment can, but it can shed some light on what’s going on under that tissue. To percuss, you place two fingers over an area and knock on your fingertips with the fingertips of the other hand. This will allow the sound to travel through the tissue.\nIn the case of masses, percussion will sound different from normal bowel tissue. Most bowel sounds are rather hollow and empty, but a mass will have a thicker, duller sound. Blockages will sound different as well, and if you are unable to hear bowel sounds in a quadrant, it may be worth percussing over the area, searching for a blockage. Percussion is an inexact science and it takes a fair amount of practice to get used to. You should try to percuss both the chest and abdomen of every patient you assess, but this isn’t always possible. However, when you can, this practice will serve both you and the patient well in determining the source of their abdominal pain.\n\nScientists have discovered why unpleasant sounds trigger a negative response. When we hear unpleasant sounds such as a fork scraping a plate or nails against a chalk board, the auditory cortex of the brain and an area of the brain called the amygdala interact to produce a negative response. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anger, and pleasure. When we hear an unpleasant sound, the amygdala heightens our perception of the sound. This heightened perception is deemed distressing and memories are formed associating the sound with unpleasantness.\nSound is a form of energy that causes air to vibrate, creating sound waves. Hearing involves the conversion of sound energy to electrical impulses. Sound waves from the air travel to our ears and are carried down the auditory canal to the ear drum. Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the ossicles of the middle ear. The ossicle bones amplify the sound vibrations as they are passed along to the inner ear. The sound vibrations are sent to the organ of Corti in the cochlea, which contains nerve fibers that extend to form the auditory nerve. As the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside the cochlea to move. Sensory cells in the cochlea called hair cells move along with the fluid resulting in the production of electro-chemical signals or nerve impulses. The auditory nerve receives the nerve impulses and sends them to the brainstem. From there the impulses are sent to the midbrain and then to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobes. The temporal lobes organize sensory input and process the auditory information so that the impulses are perceived as sound.\nListening to these sounds induced more activity in the amygdala and auditory cortex than did other sounds. When we hear an unpleasant noise, we often have an automatic physical reaction. This is due to the fact that the amygdala controls our flight or fight response. This response involves the activation of the sympathetic division of the peripheral nervous system. Activation of the nerves of the sympathetic division may result in accelerated heart rate, dilated pupils, and an increase in blood flow to the muscles. All of these activities allow us to respond appropriately to danger.\nMost people don't like to hear the sound of their own voice. When listening to a recording of your voice, you may wonder: Do I really sound like that? Our own voice sounds different to us because when we speak, the sounds vibrate internally and are transmitted directly to our inner ear. As a result, our own voice sounds deeper to us than it does to others. When we hear a recording of our voice, the sound is transmitted through the air and travels down the ear canal before reaching our inner ear. We hear this sound at a higher frequency than the sound we hear when we are speaking. The sound of our recorded voice is strange to us because it is not the same sound we hear when we speak.\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the 5th most unpleasant sound is that of nails scraping against a blackboard (listen).\nListen to the sound of a ruler on a bottle, the 4th most unpleasant sound in the study.\nThe 3rd most unpleasant sound is that of chalk on a blackboard (listen).\nThe 2nd most unpleasant sound is that of a fork scraping against a glass (listen), according to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the number one most unpleasant sound is that of a knife scraping against a bottle (listen).\nS.

Depending on the symptoms, treatment can be either short- or long-term, Edwards says. In most cases, reassessment, monitoring, and program adjustment is essential for continued improvement. Among the conditions for which BioAcoustics has shown benefit are chronic illnesses, such as arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, emphysema, gout, and hypertension; musculoskeletal disorders, including physical trauma, muscle sprains and strains, osteoporosis, sports injuries, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome; neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and senility; and psychological disorders, such as anxiety, psychosis, attention deficit disorder (ADD), and learning disorders. Edwards is in the process of developing computerized techniques to further improve the BioAcoustics technology, in the hopes that this procedure will become a routine part of preventative and diagnostic health care just like blood work or pulse taking. ### Toning\n\nFor nine years, the Institute for Music, Health, and Education, in Boulder, Colorado, founded by Don Campbell, has researched and trained students to use toning (making elongated vowel sounds and allowing them to resonate through the body) as a simple way to release stress, balance the mind and body, improve the ear's ability to listen, and improve the speaking and singing voice. \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains.\"Specific areas of the brain are tuned to specific tone frequencies,\" Campbell adds.\"The pitch of the vowel sound determines where it will resonate in the brain.\"According to Campbell, toning brings more benefit than singing or speaking, because singing and speaking move the vibratory epicenters so quickly there is no time for the body to balance itself with the sound.\n\nSinging or playing womb-like sounds in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may help slow the heart rate and improve sleep and eating patterns of premature babies, a new study suggests.\nResearchers found infants who had respiratory distress or sepsis tended to do better while listening to their parents sing a lullaby or to sounds mimicking a mother's heartbeat or fluid in the womb.\n\"We are learning from the literature and studies like this that premature infants do not necessarily grow best tucked away in an incubator,\" said Joanne Loewy, head of the Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York.\n\"Neurologic function can be enhanced with music; vital signs can be enhanced through interactive sounds and music therapy,\" she told Reuters Health.\nHer new study included 272 preemies being treated at 11 NICUs that had music therapists.\nAt different times over two weeks, babies' parents sang to them or therapists used one of two devices meant to simulate womb sounds for 10 minutes. Loewy and her colleagues compared preemies' vital signs during those periods, as well as their eating and sleeping, to times when no sounds were played.\nThey found the babies' heart rates dropped by one or two beats per minute, on average, while they listened to the lullaby and heartbeat sounds and just after they'd heard other womb-like sounds.\n\"The singing is extremely important because it represents familiarity - the baby heard the mother and father's voice as early as 16 weeks,\" Loewy explained, \"plus you have melody and rhythm in song.\"\nSucking rates sped up with the heartbeat sounds, in particular, and there was a longer-term improvement in sleep patterns tied to the womb-like fluid noises, the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics.\nPrevious research into the soothing effects of music has found mixed results among both babies and, for example, adults on ventilators in intensive care.\nThere were no babies in the new study who were exposed only to silence or quiet talking in the NICU, so the researchers can't say how these preemies would have compared to a no-music group - only that they did better while hearing music.\nThey said the sounds used in these NICUs can be replicated by parents without the help of a music therapist, if one isn't available.\n\"The wonderful thing about these instruments is that the body can take it over,\" Loewy said.\n\"We teach (parents) to hold the baby over the heart, to hold them skin-to-skin, to make ‘ahh' sounds to enhance that womb-like atmosphere.\"\nLoewy said she and her colleagues especially encourage parents to sing songs that are important to their family and culture, which can ease their stress as well.\n\nQuestion: who sings stop listen what 's that sound\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An opportunity came sooner than he anticipated when an actor did not show up and Mark took his place in a production of Stalag 17. After his military service, he acted at Foothill Playhouse in Middlesex Boro and then went to the American Theater Wing acting school in New York. During the 1930s and 1940s, he was used by Universal Studios in minor roles for several Frankenstein movies, although he played different parts in each of them.

This theme became more emphasized as the show developed in its five seasons, not only as a counterpoint to the violence of the show (the F.C.C. began pressuring networks to tone down violence in 1961 ), but to elucidate the theme of the introduction of civilization to the West, as Lucas brings Mark up with a respect for the rule of the law and fair play as part of the process of instilling moral values in his son. The emphasis on the father-son relationship also was a result of the popularity of Johnny Crawford's portrayal of Mark and his chemistry with his father.

Using songs written by others, Seeger focused on popularizing and promoting the ethic of local, historical musical influences and recognizing the cultural significance that folk music embodies. Springsteen's project began in 1997, when he recorded \"We Shall Overcome\" for the Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger tribute album, released the following year. Springsteen had not known much about Seeger given his rock and roll upbringing, and proceeded to investigate Seeger's music. While playing them in his house, his 10-year-old daughter said, \"Hey, that sounds like fun,\" which gave Springsteen more reason to continue. Soozie Tyrell, the violinist in the E Street Band, connected with a group of lesser-known musicians from New Jersey and New York City, and they joined Springsteen to record in an informal setting in Springsteen's Colts Neck farm. The Miami Horns and Springsteen's wife Patti Scialfa participated. This group would become the Sessions Band. The subsequent Bruce Springsteen with the Seeger Sessions Band Tour expanded on the album's musical approach.\n\n Seeger found inspiration for the song in October 1955 while he was on a plane bound for a concert at Oberlin College, one of the few venues which would hire him during the McCarthy era. Leafing through his notebook he saw the passage, \"Where are the flowers, the girls have plucked them. Where are the girls, they've all taken husbands. Where are the men, they're all in the army.\" These lines were taken from the traditional Cossack folk song \"Koloda-Duda\", referenced in the Mikhail Sholokhov novel And Quiet Flows the Don (1934), which Seeger had read \"at least a year or two before\". In a 2013 interview, Seeger explained that he borrowed the melody from an Irish lumberjack song with the words 'Johnson says he'll load more hay.' He simply slowed the tune \n\n Ivan Dzerzhinsky based his opera Quiet Flows the Don (Tikhiy Don) on the novel, with the libretto adapted by his brother Leonid. Premiered in October 1935, it became wildly popular after Stalin saw and praised it a few months later. The opera was proclaimed a model of socialist realism in music and won Dzerzhinsky a Stalin Prize. The lyrics for the folk song \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" by Pete Seeger and Joe Hickerson were adapted from the cossack folk \"Koloda duda\" (Ukrainian: \"колода дуда\") song sung by Daria in And Quiet Flows the Don Part 1, Chapter 3 (page 17 Knopf edition).\n\nThe Kingston Trio recorded the song in 1961. Believing it to be a traditional song, they claimed authorship, although upon notice from Seeger they had their name removed and credited Seeger and Hickerson. Seeger acknowledged their success with this song. Their single, with \"O Ken Karanga\" as the A-side and the hit \"Where Have All The Flowers Gone?\" the B-side, reached #21 in the 1962 Billboard Hot 100 chart and #4 on the Easy Listening chart. ; Peter, Paul and Mary included the song on their eponymous debut album (which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the country) in 1962. ; Marlene \n\n \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" is a modern folk-style song. Inspired lyrically by the traditional Cossack folk song \"Koloda-Duda\", Pete Seeger wrote the melody and the first three verses in 1955 and published it in Sing Out! magazine. Additional verses were added in May 1960 by Joe Hickerson, who turned it into a circular song. Its rhetorical \"where?\" and meditation on death place the song in the ubi sunt tradition. In 2010, the New Statesman listed it as one of the \"Top 20 Political Songs\". The 1964 release of the song as a Columbia Records Hall of Fame series 45 single, 13-33088, by Pete Seeger was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002 in the Folk category.\n\nQuestion: when was where have all the flowers gone written\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Exhibits include the tin mine itself, where visitors can travel down to a depth of 100 metres; a collection of over 1000 minerals; medicinal galleries; and a jewel grindery. Exhibits include the Lausitz Mining Museum, a century-old brick factory and powerstation; treasures of the earth; the pit's fire brigade \n\n Having a long history in textiles and fabrics, Dülken's economy has shifted since the 1920s towards engineering and since the 1970s towards various branches situated in the business park and industrial area Mackenstein. Simultaneously, a multitude of small and medium enterprises arose. With the closure of some engineering companies, the former factories were transformed into a number of smaller workshops and plants, a lot specialized in metal machining. Today (2014) the industrial area Mackenstein is going to be extended from Dülken to Mönchengladbach, reaching towards the Autobahn 52, in total a couple of a hundred acres additional to today's approximately 350 acre. Big employers or important companies are Otto Fuchs Metallwerke (brass and bronze products, automotive supply), KraussMaffei (tooling \n\n The year 1770 marked the beginning of the industrialization of the city, with its 250-year-old industrial history. In the first century of industrialization, the chemical and paint industry started in Schweinfurt, with the construction of the Wolf's lead white mill at the Bleiweißmühlenwehr. According to Dr. Ferdinand Gademann (1880–1969), it was the oldest German lead white factory. In 1780 the factory was taken over by Johann Martin Schmidt. Further factory-similar plants of this kind originated at the Bellevue and in the neighboring suburb Niederwerrn. Following the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, Schweinfurt came to Bavaria in 1803, two years before the Kingdom of Bavaria was founded. 4000 people demonstrated against the Anschluss at the Rossmarkt. After the \n\n Golzheim is one of the most prestigious office addresses in the city. The tallest building is the Sky Office at 22 stories which was completed in 2006. On the Ehrenhof are the NRW-Forum Kultur und Wirtschaft (North-Rhine Westphalia Forum for Culture and Trade), and the art museum (Museum Kunst Palast). The Tonhalle Düsseldorf (concert hall), located next to Oberkassel bridge on the Rhine, used to be a planetarium. It and the Rheinpark Golzheim are important places for events.  The land for the park was reclaimed from an old harbor basin in 1900 in preparation for the 1902 Exhibition, and was used for exhibition and trade fair purposes until 1926. After the international Health Fair of 1926, which had 7.5 million visitors, the area was turned into a park. Originally called \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Park\",  the Rheinpark Golzheim is not a classical park, but is more of a greenbelt, 24 hectares, between Cecilienallee and the Rhine, from the Oberkassel bridge to the Theodor Heuss bridge, with arranged copses of trees and plenty of open lawn for sunbathing and amateur volleyball games. The Circus Roncalli is located year-round in the park, and in the summer a local brewery sponsors an open-air cinema.\n\nQuestion: industrial city in germany on the rhine herne canal\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a kinematic pair called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a \n\n  The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines. By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle, wedge and inclined plane. The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints. Wedge (hand axe): Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the hand axe, also called biface and Olorgesailie. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally flint, to form a bifacial edge, or wedge. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of \n\n  The wood router typically holds wood with suction through the table or pods that raise the work above the table. Pods may be used for components which require edge profiling (or undercutting), are manufactured from solid wood or where greater flexibility in production is required. This type of bed requires less extraction with greater absolute vacuum. A second type hold down uses a spoil board. This allows vacuum suction through a low density table and allows the placement of parts anywhere on the table. These types of tables are typically used for nest-based manufacturing (NBM) where multiple components are routed from a single sheet. This type of manufacturing precludes edge drilling or undercut edge work on components. Vacuum pumps are required with both types of tables where volume and \"strength\" are determined based on the types of materials being cut.\n\n A tree chipper or woodchipper is a machine used for reducing wood (generally tree limbs or trunks) into smaller woodchips. They are often portable, being mounted on wheels on frames suitable for towing behind a truck or van. Power is generally provided by an internal combustion engine from 3 to 1000 hp. There are also high power chipper models mounted on trucks and powered by a separate engine. These models usually also have a hydraulic crane. Tree chippers are typically made of a hopper with a collar, the chipper mechanism itself, and an optional collection bin for the chips. A tree limb is inserted into the hopper (the collar serving as a partial safety mechanism to keep human body parts away from the chipping blades) and started into the chipping mechanism. The chips exit through a chute and can be directed \n\n Much larger machines for wood processing exist. \"Whole tree chippers\" and \"Recyclers\", which can typically handle material diameters of 2-6 ft may employ drums, disks, or a combination of both. The largest machines used in wood processing, often called \"Tub or Horizontal Grinders\", may handle a material diameter of 8 ft or greater, and use carbide tipped flail hammers to pulverize wood rather than cut it, producing a shredded wood rather than chip or chunk. These machines usually have a power of 200-1000 hp. Most are so heavy that they require a semi-trailer truck to be transported. Smaller models can be towed by a medium duty truck. \n\nQuestion: what is a real world application of an atwood machine\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some songs were written especially for the film or soundtrack, such as \"Burn\" by Nine Inch Nails. \"I took a finished movie,\" Reznor recalled, \"and tried to make something that would be a cool souvenir from it.\"\n\n Woody Harrelson is an American actor who made his film debut as an uncredited extra in Harper Valley PTA (1978). His breakthrough role was as bartender Woody Boyd on the NBC sitcom Cheers (1985–1993), which garnered Harrelson a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series from a total of five nominations. He would later reprise the character in other television shows, such as Frasier and The Simpsons. In 1992, Harrelson starred opposite Wesley Snipes in White Men Can't Jump.

In The Emerald City of Oz, when Ozma goes to consult Glinda about the security of her Ozian citizens, the Sorceress seals off all of Oz from the Great Outside World, making Oz invisible to the eyes of mortals flying overhead in airplanes and such. However, unlike Ozma, Glinda is willing to ignore strife and oppression in remote corners of Oz like Jinxland and the Skeezer territory as long as it does not threaten the Emerald City or innocent outsiders. The readers are left with the sense that Glinda is experienced and seasoned to the point \n\n She first appears in The Marvelous Land of Oz as a self-appointed general leading an \"Army of Revolt\"—an all-woman force seeking to end the reign of the Scarecrow and take over the Emerald City. The revolt is a parody of the contemporaneous movement for women's suffrage, which Baum supported (his mother-in-law was prominent suffragist Matilda Joslyn Gage). General Jinjur's followers use both violence (sharp knitting needles) and their feminine privileges to gain advantage: no man will hit a pretty girl, and Jinjur boasts \"there is not an ugly face in my entire Army.\" Yet those same young women are temporarily routed by an incursion of mice. Jinjur's regime assigns Emerald City husbands to domestic tasks thought to be \n\n Baum's 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz refers to Glinda as the \"Good Witch of the South\"; she does not appear in the novel until late in its development. After the Wizard flies away in his balloon, the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Dorothy, and Toto travel South to the land of the Quadlings to ask Glinda for her advice. In the well-known 1939 film version, Glinda is a composite character with the Witch of the North. Later books call her a \"Sorceress\" rather than a \"witch\", though Baum's writings make clear that he did not view witches as inherently wicked. In \n\n As with the original film, The Wizard of Oz video game depicts Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin-Man, and the Scarecrow traveling to the Emerald City to bring the Ruby Slippers and Glinda's magic to the titular Wizard of Oz.

This is generally a steady decline, although if the ambient temperature is above the body temperature (such as in a hot desert), the change in temperature will be positive, as the (relatively) cooler body acclimates to the warmer environment. External factors can have a significant influence. The term was first used by Bennet Dowler in 1849. The first published measurements of the intervals of temperature after death were done by John Davy in 1839.\n\nRigor mortis (Latin: rigor \"stiffness\", and mortis \"of death\"), or postmortem rigidity, is the third stage of death. It is one of the recognizable signs of death, characterized by stiffening of the limbs of the corpse caused by chemical changes in the muscles postmortem (mainly calcium). In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as four hours after death. Contrary to folklore and common belief, rigor mortis is not permanent and begins to pass within hours of onset. Typically, it lasts no longer than eight hours at \"room temperature\".\n\nPhysiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.\n\nCalcium enters the cytosol after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. Normal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.\n\nDecomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.\n\nPhysical changes \nAt the time of death, a condition called \"primary flaccidity\" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers.\n\nRigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs, within the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis generally peaks at 12 hours, and dissipates after 48 hours.\n\nRigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.\n\nApplications in meat industry \nRigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. \n\nCold shortening is caused by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.\n\nApplication in forensic pathology \nThe degree of rigor mortis may be used in forensic pathology to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as livor mortis can be applied.  If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it.\n\nRigor mortis is known as transient evidence, as the degree to which it affects a body degrades over time. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.  Low temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.\n\nSee also \n Cadaveric spasm\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n Bear, Mark F; Connors, Barry W.; Paradiso, Michael A., Neuroscience, Exploring the Brain, Philadelphia : Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; Third Edition (1 February 2006). \n Robert G.

It is one of the recognizable signs of death, characterized by stiffening of the limbs of the corpse caused by chemical changes in the muscles postmortem (mainly calcium). In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as four hours after death. Contrary to folklore and common belief, rigor mortis is not permanent and begins to pass within hours of onset. Typically, it lasts no longer than eight hours at \"room temperature\".\n\nPhysiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.\n\nCalcium enters the cytosol after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. Normal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.\n\nDecomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.\n\nPhysical changes \nAt the time of death, a condition called \"primary flaccidity\" occurs.

They are strongly associated with Strummerville, The Joe Strummer Foundation for New Music, and feature on Island/Communion's \"Flowerpot Collaborations\" album. The trio is composed of Dan Grabiner (vocals, percussion), Josh Elliott (saxophone, accordion, saw, ukulele) and Justin Gartry (guitar, kick-drum)  and their sound has been compared to various genres including soul, blues, psychedelia, rock 'n' roll, folk and rhythm & blues. The Evening Standard has described the band as \"the real stars of 2011\" and Clash Magazine call them a \"rip-roaring trio\"\n\n song was later recorded with Jeff Lynne's ELO, and included on their album A New World Record, released in 1976. ; 2009: \"Outer Space\" – from the album Anomaly. ; 2014: \"Gimme a Feelin'\" – from the album Space Invader. ; 2014: \"The Joker\" – from the album Space Invader.

It was released on May 18, 2004 through Psychopathic Records and consists of nine previously unreleased tracks and five remixes, including a \"surprisingly faithful\" cover of the Steve Miller Band's \"The Joker\". AllMusic's reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote \"The song is likely a coded reference to those obsessed-over joker cards. But it's nice to think of Twiztid as regular-guy Michiganders, singing karaoke at the local sports bar\". Production was handled primarily by Fritz the Cat, except a couple of tracks produced by Amare Yaodaming. The project features guest appearances of Dark Lotus members. The album peaked at #85 on the Billboard 200 and at #2 on the Independent Albums in the United States.\n\n \"Joker\" is a song performed by Swiss singer Anna Rossinelli from her debut studio album Bon Voyage. The single was released on 14 October 2011 as a digital download in Switzerland. The song was written by Phillipa Alexander, Ellie Wyatt, Alex Ball, Vicky Nolan and produced by Fred Herrmann.

The story was a retrospective first-person narrative from Pi, a then 16-year-old boy from India, who is the only human to survive the sinking of a freighter on the way from India to Canada. He finds himself on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena, a wounded zebra and a Bengal tiger. During this unlikely journey, young Pi questions his belief in God and the meaning of life. The novel was once considered impossible to make into a movie, but Lee \n\n Life of Pi is a 2012 adventure drama film based on Yann Martel's 2001 novel of the same name. Directed by Ang Lee, and written by David Magee, the film stars Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Rafe Spall, Tabu, Adil Hussain, and Gérard Depardieu. The storyline revolves around an Indian teenager named \"Pi\" Patel, telling a novelist about his life story, and how at 16 he survives a shipwreck and is adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. The film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuarón and Jean-Pierre Jeunet involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was split between India, Taiwan \n\n Life of Pi is a Canadian philosophical novel by Yann Martel published in 2001. The protagonist is Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel, an Indian Tamil boy from Pondicherry who explores issues of spirituality and metaphysics from an early age. He survives 227 days after a shipwreck while stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger which raises questions about the nature of reality and how it is perceived and told. The novel has sold more than ten million copies worldwide. It was rejected by at least five London publishing houses before being accepted by Knopf Canada, which published it in September 2001. \n\n  Richard Parker is an adult Bengal tiger who is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks. Richard Parker lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers. Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle. In the novel, a hunter named Richard Parker is hired to kill a panther that has been terrorising the people of a small village in Bangladesh and thought to have killed seven people within two months. Instead, he accidentally immobilizes a female Bengal tiger with tranquilizer darts while her cub is caught hiding in a bush. Parker names the cub Thirsty after his enthusiasm when drinking from a nearby river. The paperwork that accompanies the shipment of the two tigers to Pi's family's zoo in Pondicherry states that the cub's name is \"Richard Parker\" and the hunter's given name is \"Thirsty\" and his surname is \"None Given\", due to a mix-up with the names. Pi's father finds the story so amusing that they continue to call the tiger \"Richard Parker\".\n\nQuestion: what is the tigers name in life of pi\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In common with the United Kingdom, Crown dependencies and other British territories, the official national anthem of Gibraltar is God Save the Queen. The Gibraltar anthem is the national song, and was chosen in a competition in 1994. Both the lyrics and music were composed by Peter Emberley, who is not a Gibraltarian. The anthem is sung every 10 September by the general public at the annual release of red and white ticker paper on Gibraltar National Day. Balloons used to be released, but this was stopped following concerns about the impact on the environment.\n\n \"Advance Australia Fair\" is the national anthem of Australia. Written by Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878, sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It first replaced \"God Save the Queen\" in 1974 as the official national anthem, following a nationwide opinion survey. \"God Save the Queen\" was reinstated in January 1976, with \"Advance Australia Fair\", returning in 1984. This followed a plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977. \"God Save the Queen\" became known as the royal anthem, which is used at public engagements attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family. The 1984 version of \"Advance Australia Fair\" has lyrics modified from McCormick's original and verses trimmed down from four to two. In January 2021 the lyrics were changed again.\n\n Music and song are utilised in various ways as reminders and identifiers of the sovereign or viceroys. By tradition, the tune \"God Save the King\" (or \"God Save the Queen\" in the reign of a female monarch) was heard in the Canadian colonies since the late 18th century and continued to be played after Confederation in 1867. In 1980, \"O Canada\" was adopted as the national anthem and \"God Save the Queen\" became, by convention, the Royal Anthem, for use as a musical salute to the sovereign in person or as a display of loyalty in any circumstance. It was also incorporated into the Canadian \n\n \"E Ola Ke Alii Ke Akua\", translated as God Save the King, was one of Hawaii's four national anthems. It was composed in 1860 by then 25-year-old Prince William Charles Lunalilo, who later became King Lunalilo. Prior to 1860, the Hawaiian Kingdom lacked its own national anthem and had used the British royal anthem God Save The King. A contest was sponsored in 1860 by Kamehameha IV, who wanted a song with Hawaiian lyrics set to the tune of the British anthem. The winning entry was written by Lunalilo and was reputed to have been written in 20 minutes. Lunalilo was awarded 10 dollars which he later donated to the Queen's Hospital. His composition became Hawaii's first national anthem. It remained Hawaii's national anthem until 1866, when it was replaced by Queen Liliuokalani's composition He Mele Lāhui Hawaii.\n\n \"God Save the Queen\" is the royal anthem of Canada. There are various claims of authorship and several previous songs of similar style, but the first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The song has been used in Canada since the era when it was a collection of British colonies and \"God Save the King\" (or \"God Save the Queen\" during the reign of Queen Victoria) was played in honour of the British monarch. It has remained in use through Canada's progression to independence, becoming eventually one of the country's two de facto national anthems. After \"O Canada\" was in 1980 proclaimed the national anthem, \"God Save The Queen\" has been performed as the royal anthem, in the presence of the Canadian monarch, other members of the Royal Family, and as part of the salute accorded to the Governor General of Canada and provincial lieutenant governors, as well as on other occasions.\n\nQuestion: when did god save the queen became the national anthem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the Working Time Directive article 7 refers to paid annual leave of \"at least four weeks\", but does not directly define a \"week\", and nor do the regulations. Article 5 states that the \"weekly rest period\" means a \"seven-day period\". When the Directive was implemented in the UK, regulation 13 originally stated \"four weeks\" but many employers only gave their workers four five-day periods of leave (i.e. 20 days). In response the UK government amended the regulations in 2007 to add the further 1.6 week period, bringing the minimum in line with the European Union requirement for four full weeks (i.e. 28 days). However, this confusion led to the argument that the UK had gone beyond the minimum standards required by the Working Time Directive 2003, even though no country in the EU has a right to fewer holidays than 28 days.\n\n of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits. Full-time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each workweek. The \"standard\" work week consists of five eight-hour days, commonly served between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM or 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days, it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36-hour workweek. Twelve-hour shifts are often \n\n All Israeli workers are entitled to a weekly consecutive rest period of at least 36 hours, although with a special permit from the Ministry of Labor, it can be reduced to a minimum of 25 hours. Israelis typically follow a Sunday-Thursday five-day workweek, although some have a Sunday-Friday six-day work week with a half-day on Friday. This is done to accommodate the Jewish Sabbath and Muslim Jumu'ah. All Israeli employees with a five-day workweek are entitled to a minimum of 12 paid vacation days for the first four years of employment, while those with a six-day workweek are entitled to 14 \n\n Israeli law sets out a 43-hour workweek. This is being reduced to 42 hours as of 1 April 2018. For those with a five-day workweek, the length of a work day is set out as 8.6 hours, while those with a six-day workweek have a work day of 8 hours, with a half-day of work on Friday. Those with a work day of at least six hours are entitled to 45 minutes of rest, including an uninterrupted 30-minute break, although with a special permit those working in non-manual jobs can have full workdays without breaks. However, in practice, additional time is added to make up for these breaks, leading to a maximum 45-hour workweek. As a result, many employees in Israel work 45 hours a week, or 9 hours a day for 5 days. Any \n\n In addition to raising his workers' wages, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week, but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week. The program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day, 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August. Ford had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time. Ford also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. Ford explained, \"It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege.\"\n\nQuestion: when did the 5 day work week begin\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The north and south geomagnetic poles are the antipodal points where the axis of this theoretical dipole intersects Earth's surface. If Earth's magnetic field were a perfect dipole then the field lines would be vertical at the geomagnetic poles, and they would coincide with the magnetic poles. However, the approximation is imperfect, and so the magnetic and geomagnetic poles lie some distance apart. Like the north magnetic pole, the north geomagnetic pole attracts the north pole of a bar magnet and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic south pole. It is the center of the region of the magnetosphere in which the Aurora Borealis can be seen. As of 2015 it was located at approximately 80.37°N, -72.62°W, over Ellesmere Island, Canada but it is now drifting away from North America and toward Siberia.\n\n North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun. Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt). For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the March and September equinoxes, when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.\n\n The north pole of a magnet is defined as the pole that, when the magnet is freely suspended, points towards the Earth's North Magnetic Pole in the Arctic (the magnetic and geographic poles do not coincide, see magnetic declination). Since opposite poles (north and south) attract, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field. As a practical matter, to tell which pole of a magnet is north and which is south, it is not necessary to use the Earth's magnetic field at all. For example, one method would be to compare it to an electromagnet, whose poles can be identified by the right-hand rule. The magnetic field lines of a magnet are considered by convention to emerge from the magnet's north pole and reenter at the south pole.\n\n Like the North Magnetic Pole, the North Geomagnetic Pole attracts the north pole of a bar magnet and so is in a physical sense actually a magnetic south pole. It is the center of the 'open' magnetic field lines which connect to the interplanetary magnetic field and provide a direct route for the solar wind to reach the ionosphere. , it will be located at 80.65°N, -72.68°W, on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, compared to 2015, when it was located at 80.37°N, -72.62°W, also on Ellesmere Island.

By the conclusion of the United States's involvement over 3.1 million Americans had been stationed in Vietnam. At home this involvement played a key role in sparking the Civil Rights Movement, hippie culture and wide ranging changes in popular culture. The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from a combination of factors: Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong's pledge in 1950 to support Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh's guerrilla forces against France's colionial occupation, the U.S. war with Japan in the Pacific, and domestic pressure to act against communism after the loss of mainland China and indecisive conclusion of the Korean War. The U.S. was initially adamantly against \n\n The Vietnam War was fought between communist North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other nations. The United States entered the war to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment. Military advisors arrived beginning in 1950. U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s and combat units were deployed beginning in 1965. Involvement peaked in 1968 at the time of the Tet Offensive. During the Vietnam War, an estimated 48,000 Puerto Ricans served in the four branches of the armed forces. Amongst the \n\n  1975 marked the end of the Vietnam War, sometimes called the Second Indochina War or the American War. The North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched the Spring Offensive in March; the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) was quickly defeated. The North Vietnamese captured Saigon on April 30, accepting the surrender of South Vietnam. In the final days of the war, the United States, which had supported South Vietnam for many years, carried out an emergency evacuation of its civilian and military personnel and more than 130,000 Vietnamese. At the beginning of the Spring Offensive the balance of forces in Vietnam was approximately as follows; North Vietnam: 305,000 soldiers, 600 armored vehicles and 490 heavy artillery pieces in South Vietnam and South Vietnam: 1.0 million soldiers, 1,200 to 1,400 tanks and more than 1,000 pieces of heavy artillery. The capital city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, was captured by the Khmer Rouge on April 17. On December 2 the Pathet Lao took over the government of Laos, thus completing the communist conquest of the three Indochinese countries.\n\n The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and in Vietnam as the American War, occurred from 1959 to April 30, 1975. The term Vietnam Conflict is often used to refer to events which took place between 1959 and April 30, 1975. The war was fought between the Communist-supported Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the United States supported Republic of Vietnam. It concluded with the defeat and failure of the United States foreign policy in Vietnam. On April 30, 1975, the capital of South Vietnam, Saigon fell to the communist forces of North Vietnam, effectively ending the Vietnam War. Over 8.7 million U.S. forces participated in the Vietnam War; of whom slightly over 47,000 were killed in battle and almost 11,000 more died of non-battle causes. During the Vietnam War three Asian Americans received the Medal of Honor, all of them posthumously. Elmelindo Smith, although wounded multiple times was killed while fighting with his unit. Terry Kawamura sacrificed his life by jumping on an explosive charge, saving the lives of two other soldiers, and Rodney Yano sacrificed his life by throwing burning ammunition off of a helicopter after a grenade exploded prematurely.\n\n The 1959 to 1963 phase of the Vietnam War started after the North Vietnamese had made a firm decision to commit to a military intervention in the guerrilla war in the South Vietnam, a buildup phase began, between the 1959 North Vietnamese decision and the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, which led to a major US escalation of its involvement. Vietnamese communists saw this as a second phase of their revolution, the US now substituting for the French. Between the Geneva accords in 1954 and 1956, the two states created by the talks were still forming; the influence of major powers, especially France and the United States, \n\nQuestion: when did the us stop drafting for the vietnam war\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The first commercially sold portable was the 50 lb IBM 5100, introduced 1975. The next major portables were Osborne's 24 lb CP/M-based Osborne 1 (1981) and Compaq's 28 lb, advertised as 100% IBM PC compatible Compaq Portable (1983). These \"luggable\" computers lacked the next technological development, not requiring an external power source; that feature was introduced by the laptop.

The modern personal computer emerged in the 1970s, after several breakthroughs in semiconductor technology. These include the first working transistor by William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs in 1947, the silicon surface passivation process (via thermal oxidation) by Mohamed Atalla at Bell Labs in 1957, the monolithic integrated circuit chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, or MOS transistor) by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959,   and the single-chip microprocessor (Intel 4004) by Federico Faggin, Marcian Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971.\n\n 1989, Apple released the Macintosh Portable, it weighed 7.3 kg and was extremely expensive, costing US$7,300. At launch it was one of the most powerful laptops available, but due to the price and weight, it was not met with great success, and was discontinued only two years later. That same year Intel introduced the Touchstone Delta supercomputer, which had 512 microprocessors. This technological advancement was very significant, as it was used as a model for some of the fastest multi-processor systems in the world. It was even used as a prototype for Caltech researchers, who used the model for projects like real time processing of satellite images and simulating molecular models for various fields of research.\n\n The Toshiba T1100 is a laptop manufactured by Toshiba in 1985, and has subsequently been described by Toshiba as \"the world's first mass-market laptop computer\".

Its original price was 1899 USD. The T1100 PLUS is a later model of this laptop, released to the market in 1986. Some significant differences to the T1100 are, 80C86 CPU, 7.16 MHz or 4.77 MHz operation, 256 kB of conventional RAM (16-bit) extendable to 640 kB, and two internal diskette drives.

However, for season 2, Fred and Velma returned to the show after a four year absence. The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries ran for another season on ABC. Thirteen half-hour episodes, composed of twenty-four separate segments were produced under the New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo title in 1983, and thirteen more episodes, composed of twenty separate segments were produced under the name The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries in 1984.

Reclusive and humble to a fault, he lamented his inexperience and lack of qualifications, but actually fared well and showed himself to be decisive and firm when necessary. His term in office came at a time of great instability and he presided over the votes of no confidence in Sprigg's government and the application of martial law in the Cape Colony. In 1902 he distinguished himself with his strong opposition to the attempt by the British Colonial Office to suspend the Cape constitution. He sought re-election in 1908, but was not returned to office (only being re-elected as an ordinary member in the 1910 election).

When the group comes to a local tribe's territory, some of the Africans require a toll to be paid for walking through their territory. They are friendly, peaceful, smiling, and non-violent; the guide demands that they be paid, but the expedition's investor ignores this advice, brushes the Africans aside, and physically knocks the tribal leader to the ground, who is barring his way. Animosity spreads across faces except for the investor. No violent retribution immediately occurs, and the Europeans are allowed to walk past the warriors guarding their border.\n\n In 1551, King João III of Portugal gave Archduke Maximilian an unusual wedding present: an elephant named Solomon or Suleiman. This elephant's journey from Lisbon to Vienna was witnessed and remarked upon by scholars, historians, and ordinary people.

Solomon and his keeper, Subhro, begin in dismal conditions, forgotten in a corner of the palace grounds.

On November 10, 2020, Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip, the Apple M1, in the Late 2020 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro. Apple has said that it will support Intel Macs \"for years to come\", and most software that has not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use Rosetta 2, an update of a compatibility mechanism originally developed for the PowerPC-to-Intel x86 transition. Likewise, Apple also introduced an updated universal binary format, Universal 2, which allows developers to package their applications so that they can run natively on both ARM64 and x86-64 processors.\n\n macOS Big Sur (version 11) is the seventeenth major release of macOS, Apple Inc.'s operating system for Macintosh computers.

Half dollar coins were commonly used currency since inception in 1794, but has fallen out of use from the mid-1960s when all silver half dollars began to be hoarded. The nickel is the only coin whose size and composition (5 grams, 75% copper, and 25% nickel) is still in use from 1865 to today, except for wartime 1942-1945 Jefferson nickels which contained silver. Due to the penny's low value, some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage. For a discussion of other discontinued and canceled denominations, see Obsolete denominations of United States currency and Canceled denominations of United States currency.\n\n The pre-decimal twopence (2d) ( or ) was a coin worth 1/120 of a pound sterling, or two pence. It was a short-lived denomination in copper, being minted in only 1797 by Matthew Boulton's Soho Mint. These coins were made legal tender for amounts of up to one shilling by a proclamation of 26 July 1797. Short-lived twopence coins in silver were also minted in 1817, 1818 and 1820. Twopence coins were made redundant in 1860 with the advent of bronze coinage.\n\n Monticello's image has appeared on U.S. currency and postage stamps. An image of the west front of Monticello by Felix Schlag has been featured on the reverse of the nickel minted since 1938 (with a brief interruption in 2004 and 2005, when designs of the Westward Journey series appeared instead). It was also used as the title for the 2015 play Jefferson's Garden, which centred on his life. Monticello also appeared on the reverse of the two-dollar bill from 1928 to 1966, when the bill was discontinued. The current bill was introduced in 1976 and retains Jefferson's portrait on the obverse but replaced Monticello on the reverse with an engraved modified reproduction of John Trumbull's 1818 painting Declaration of Independence. The gift shop at Monticello hands out two-dollar bills as change. The 1994 commemorative Thomas Jefferson 250th Anniversary silver dollar features Monticello on the reverse.\n\n A two dollar banknote was used in New Zealand from the start of the dollar in 1967 until 1991 when the coins became widely circulated. The original ideas to produce one- and two-dollar coins were proposed in 1986 because of ongoing inflation which had lowered the value of the dollar and would cause the demonetisation of the one and two cent coins in 1988. From its first year until 1998 the coin featured on its obverse the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by the British-Palestinian sculptor Raphael Maklouf. It had the text ELIZABETH II on the left of the portrait, NEW ZEALAND on the right and the date at the bottom. The effigy was replaced in 1999 by a portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley, which had been introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in 1998. It reversed the position of the writing, moving the Queen's name \n\n $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Notes above the $100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969. These notes were used primarily in inter-bank transactions or by organized crime; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use. With the advent of electronic banking, they became less necessary. Notes in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $100,000 were all produced at one time; see large denomination bills in U.S. currency for details.

The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security, given the favorable experience of Vietnam. Soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally; approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. By 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States. Economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.\n\n common. Similar weather patterns throughout Central America has resulted in yields of important crops being expected to fall by up to 29% over the coming decades. Overall, climate change is expected to reduce agricultural income by 15-25%. In many countries, such as India and the United States, governments are shifting Sustainable Development Goals to the forefront of their priorities. This shift involves developing climate-resilient agricultural approaches that emphasize sustainability and productivity. The Indian Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare alongside Indian Council of Agricultural Research, has taken several policies towards this. The main focus of their climate-resilient approach is adapting current agricultural technologies, managing resources, improving crop monitoring, and building soil and environmental health. Resulting policies \n\n Agriculture remains the main stay of the Nigerian economy in spite of oil as it employs two-third of the entire working population. The sector is fraught with challenges as agricultural production is still mainly rainfed and subject to weather vagaries. Farmers find it hard to plan their operations due to unpredictable rainfall vagaries. Increase in the total amount of rainfall and extreme temperature would have more of a negative effect on staple crops productivity. However in northern states such as Borno, Yobe, Kaduna, Kano and Sokoto most crops might benefit economically. Crops such as millet, melon, sugarcane that are grown in the north will most likely benefit from extreme temperature. The sector is also plagued with outdated land tenure system that limits access to land (1.8 ha/farming household), reduced irrigation development capacity (cropped land under irrigation less than 1 percent), limited access to credits, low adoption of technologies, expensive farm inputs, limited access to fertilizers, inadequate storage facilities and limited market access. All of these combined, have reduced agricultural productivity (average of 1.2 metric tons of cereals/ha) coupled with high postharvest losses and waste.\n\n Throughout the world, most agroforestry systems have been practiced since the Neolithic period. Indians consider Ashok Vatika, a garden in Hindu epic Ramayana, which consisted of plants and fruit-bearing trees, as an example of an agroforestry system. Even today, there are many rituals associated with the trees and agricultural farms in India. Since the 1970s, in line with initiatives taken by other countries, the Indian government has also promoted research in the field of agroforestry. Even though agriculture was valued by social and religious practices; some experts noted that various government regulations were seen as an impediment in advancing agroforestry. Another aspect for the need of an agroforestry policy was the lack of the forest and tree cover in India. According to the Forest Survey of India in 2019, the country had 80.7 million hectares of forest and tree cover, which accounts to 24.56% of the total geographic area in the country; however, the country requires one third (33.3%) of its land under forest and tree cover, according to the National Forest Policy.\n\nThe survey projects India's growth at 6–6.5% in the next fiscal year starting from 1 April 2020. ; The survey provides facts to show that India's GDP figures are genuine. ; The industrial growth for the current year has been listed as 2.5% while the agricultural growth is 2.8%. ; Total formal employment has increased from 2011–12.

It was written by Trainor, Eric Frederic, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Jason Desrouleaux, Peter Svensson, and produced by Ricky Reed. The track was released on May 5, 2016, as the second single from the album. The electro and R&B song has lyrics about self-love and self-empowerment, and urges listeners to be more content and confident in themselves.

The song is famous for Wonder's imitation of a seasoned country-and-western crooner and his inspiring drumming. Charlie and Ronnie Wilson of The Gap Band provide backing vocals on the song. It was covered by Eric Clapton in 2001.\n\n \"It Wasn't Me\" was Shaggy's first number one hit in the United States. The song reached number two for two weeks from 16 December to 23 December 2000. On 30 December, it was bumped down one position to number three. It moved back up to the number two spot on 4 January 2001. The song peaked at number one for two weeks in February, unseating Destiny's Child's \"Independent Women Part 1\". The song also reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on 4 March 2001, selling 345,000 copies, making the song a transatlantic chart topper. It also reached number one in Australia on 1 April 2001. It is also the 11th biggest selling single of the 21st century in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 1.42 million as of September 2017. As of August 2014, it is the 49th best selling single of the 21st century in France, with 399,500 units sold.\n\n \"It Won't Be Me\" is a song written by Tom Shapiro and Chris Waters, and recorded by American country music artist Tanya Tucker. It was released in October 1990 as the third single from the album Tennessee Woman. The song reached #6 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart.\n\n \"It Wasn't Me\" is the first single from Jamaican reggae musician Shaggy's fifth studio album, Hot Shot (2000). The song features vocals from Rikrok. The lyrics of the song depict one man (Rikrok) asking his friend (Shaggy) what to do after his girlfriend caught him cheating on her with \"the girl next door\". His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" \"It Wasn't Me\" was released to contemporary hit radio on 7 November 2000 and has been regarded as Shaggy's breakthrough in the pop market. It is his highest-charting song to date, topping the charts in Australia, Austria, Flanders, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In the opening round of the playoffs, the Celtics were defeated by the Brooklyn Nets in five games. Following the season, Danny Ainge left his position as general manager, and named head coach Brad Stevens as his replacement.\n\n After the NBA suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league started to explore implementing a special postseason format just for this year. On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble, with 22 of the 30 teams in the league, all clubs within six games of a playoff spot. Under this plan, the 22 teams played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible best-of-three play-in series for the final seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed. \n\n The regular season began on October 12, 2016, and ended on April 9, 2017. The playoffs began on April 12, 2017, and ended on June 11, 2017. The schedule was released on June 21, 2016. Each team will receive a five-day \"bye week\" and no practices can be held during the time period.\n\nQuestion: when does the nba season end this year\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Reagan threatened states with withholding 5% of federal funding for highways if they did not comply with increasing the drinking age to 21. In 2007, the drinking age debate in the United States was renewed when Choose Responsibility began promoting the lowering of the drinking age coupled with education and rules to persuade people to drink responsibly before they are of legal age. Before one is eligible to buy, possess and consume alcohol, an alcohol education class must be completed in its entirety and each teen \n\n young adults that are affected, people into their sixties struggle with alcoholism. The movement of young adults from high school to college shows that 44% of college students were binge drinkers and that binge drinking peaked at age 21. Approximately three quarters of college students aged 18–20 years old drank alcohol in 2009. Within the U.S., youth are being targeted by social media in order to drive sales higher by highlighting alcohol consumption in a positive way. The legal drinking age was set to 21 years of age because studies showed that the leading cause of death of people age 1 to 34 accounted for one third of deaths due to unintentional injury from alcohol consumption.\n\n Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. He believed that doing so would decrease the number of accidents related to drunk driving, because he said that states with a drinking age of 21+ did not have as many drunk driving accidents. Reagan said that although he wished states would create their \n\n that stores selling alcohol are open. They feel that this contributes to their lower numbers of alcohol-related problems. The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. In 1985, South Dakota challenged the NMDAA, but in 1987 the Supreme Court ruled the Act was constitutional for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, the Court indicated that the States still had the right to set \n\n The legal drinking age varies from country to country. In the United States, the legal drinking age is currently 21. To curb excessive alcohol consumption by younger persons, instead of raising the drinking age other countries have raised the prices of alcohol beverages and have encouraged the general public to drink less. Setting a legal drinking age of 21 is designed to discourage reckless alcohol consumption by youth, limiting consumption to those who are more mature, who can be expected to make reasonable and wise decisions when it comes to drinking.\n\nQuestion: when was the drinking age set to 21\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He played college football at Georgia, where he was first-team All-American, and was selected first overall by the Detroit Lions in the 2009 NFL Draft. Ranking in the top 20 for all-time in pass attempts, completions, passing yards, and passing touchdowns, Stafford is third in all-time passing yards per game and was the fastest NFL player to reach 40,000 yards. As the Lions' primary starter from 2009 to 2020, Stafford had a breakout season in 2011 when he became the fourth NFL quarterback to throw for over 5,000 yards in a single season, while leading the Lions to their first playoff appearance since 1999. He led Detroit to two further postseason runs in 2014 and 2016, earning Pro Bowl honors during the former and setting the NFL season record for most comeback wins in the latter. After mutually agreeing to part ways with the Lions, Stafford was traded to the Rams for the 2021 season.\n\n William Alan Munson (August 11, 1941 – July 10, 2000) was an American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) from 1964 through 1979.

It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process.\n\nThere are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. Pyruvate then enters the mitochondrion for further processing.\n\nDuring the formation of acetyl-CoA, each pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, resulting in the release of CO2 and the production of NADH, a molecule that carries energy.\n\nThe acetyl-CoA then enters the Krebs cycle, where it undergoes a series of chemical reactions that generate more energy-carrying molecules including NADH and FADH2.\n\nThe final stage, oxidative phosphorylation, occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. NADH and FADH2 donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, which creates a proton gradient across the membrane. This proton gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis.\n\nIn summary, ATP is produced through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose, the production of energy-carrying molecules, and the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion.\n\n In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are recycled (to NAD+ and FAD, respectively), generating additional ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP. \n\n A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.\n\nThe net products of the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), include ATP, NADH, FADH2, and CO2. These products are generated through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that occur within the mitochondria.\n\nDuring the citric acid cycle, a two-carbon molecule called acetyl CoA combines with a four-carbon molecule called oxaloacetate to form a six-carbon molecule called citrate. Through a series of enzymatic reactions, citrate is gradually transformed back into oxaloacetate, completing one cycle.\n\nIn the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2.\n\nIn addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nThe cycle produces three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2, which carry electrons to the electron transport chain for further ATP generation. NADH and FADH2 are also important for the synthesis of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nOverall, the citric acid cycle is crucial for the breakdown of fuel molecules, such as glucose and fatty acids, to generate ATP and provide the cell with energy. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism.\n\nThe three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is the initial step in the breakdown of glucose, where glucose is converted into pyruvate. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules.\n\nAfter glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide.\n\nThe final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient. The flow of protons through ATP synthase leads to the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\nOverall, these three components work together to convert glucose into ATP, providing the cells with the energy they need to carry out essential functions.\n\nQuestion: how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As the nerve fibers pass through the lamina cribrosa sclerae they lose their medullary sheaths and are continued onward through the choroid and retina as simple axis-cylinders. When they reach the internal surface of the retina they radiate from their point of entrance over this surface grouped in bundles, and in many places arranged in plexuses. Most of the fibers are centripetal, and are the direct continuations \n\nOptic atrophy and papilledema involve different structures within the visual pathways. Optic atrophy is associated with a change in color of the optic disk to light pink, white, or gray, and is commonly caused by multiple sclerosis or it may be inherited. It can be classified as primary (simple) optic atrophy, which is caused by a process that directly involves the optic nerve, or secondary optic atrophy, which is a sequela of papilledema and may be due to glaucoma or increased intracranial pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, papilledema refers to optic disk swelling caused by increased intracranial pressure. It is characterized by moderate disk elevation without hemorrhages. Papilledema can lead to secondary optic atrophy, which involves the degeneration and loss of optic nerve fibers. In papilledema, increased pressure affects the optic nerve and its associated structures, causing damage to the nerve fibers and subsequent visual impairment.\n\nThe visual pathways comprise the optic nerve and optic chiasm, which are essential for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. The optic nerve consists of about a million nerve fibers that arise from the inner, ganglion cell layer of the retina. These fibers pass through the lamina cribrosa of the sclera and then course through the optic canal of the skull to form the optic chiasm.\n\nWithin the optic chiasm, fibers from the nasal half of the retina decussate (cross over to the opposite side), while fibers from the lateral (temporal) half do not cross over. This arrangement allows for the integration of visual information from both eyes in the brain. From the optic chiasm, the visual pathways continue to the visual cortex in the brain, where visual processing occurs.\n\nTo summarize, optic atrophy is associated with changes in the optic disk color and can be primary or secondary, while papilledema is characterized by optic disk swelling caused by increased intracranial pressure. Both conditions involve structures such as the optic nerve and optic chiasm within the visual pathways.\n\nThus the optic tracts, occipital lobe, lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus, and optic chiasm each contain nerve fibers from both eyes.The fibers from the temporal part of each eye do not cross at the optic chiasm, pass through the lateral geniculate body on the same side of the brain, and continue back to the occipital lobe.visual hallucinations [L, visus, vision, alucinari] , a subjective visual experience in the absence of objective evidence of a corresponding stimulus. Such hallucinations are most likely to be associated with acute organic disorders such as toxic confusional psychoses, delirium, and focal brain diseases and may occur with any stage of schizophrenia. visualization /vizh′o̅o̅·əlīzā″shən/ , an effective means of deepening relaxation and desensitizing a real-life situation that is generally met with stress and tension. The imagery combines positive experiences with actual or perceived negative events or situations in an effort to desensitize the person to the trauma. Also called guided imagery, visual imagery. visual memory, the ability to create an eidetic image of past visual experiences. Also called eye memory. visual-motor coordination, the ability to coordinate vision with the movements of the body or parts of the body. visual-motor function, the ability to draw or copy forms or to perform constructive tasks. visual pathway, a pathway over which a visual sensation is transmitted from the retina to the brain. A pathway consists of an optic nerve, the fibers of an optic nerve traveling through the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, and optic radiations terminating in an occipital lobe. Each optic nerve contains fibers from only one retina. The optic chiasm contains fibers from the nasal parts of the retinas of both eyes; these fibers cross to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. The fibers from the temporal part of each eye do not cross at the optic chiasm, pass through the lateral geniculate body on the same side of the brain, and continue back to the occipital lobe. Thus the optic tracts, occipital lobe, lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus, and optic chiasm each contain nerve fibers from both eyes.Visual pathway (Lewis et al, 2007)\nvisual plane, the plane in which the two optic axes lie.visual purple.See rhodopsin.visual rehabilitation services, professional services provided to individuals who have lost vision or have low vision.Services are designed to facilitate full participation and independence in activities of daily living.\n\n Complete crossing (decussation) of the nerves at the optic chiasm in birds has also stimulated research. Complete decussation of the optic tract has been seen as a method of ensuring the open eye strictly activates the contralateral hemisphere. Some evidence indicates that this alone is not enough as blindness would theoretically prevent USWS if retinal nerve stimuli were the sole player. However, USWS is still exhibited in blinded birds despite the absence of visual input.\n\nThe optic chiasm plays a crucial role in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. It is located at the base of the brain and is where the optic nerves partially cross over. This crossing allows for a specific arrangement of visual information to be transmitted to different areas of the brain.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it is detected by specialized cells called photoreceptors in the retina. The retina then converts this light into electrical signals that are carried by the optic nerves towards the brain. These optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm, where some fibers from each nerve cross over to join fibers from the opposite side.\n\nThis crossing over of fibers has important implications for how visual information is processed in the brain. It allows for binocular vision, which means that both eyes contribute to our perception of depth and three-dimensional vision. The crossed fibers carry information from one side of each eye to the opposite side of the brain, while uncrossed fibers carry information from each eye to its corresponding side of the brain.\n\nAfter crossing at the optic chiasm, these fibers continue their journey along pathways known as optic tracts towards specific regions in the brain responsible for processing visual information. The majority of these fibers go to a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in thalamus, which acts as a relay station before sending signals to other parts of the brain involved in vision, such as primary visual cortex.\n\nIn summary, through its role in allowing partial crossover of optic nerve fibers, the optic chiasm enables binocular vision and contributes to our ability to perceive depth and three-dimensional space. It serves as a critical junction point where visual information begins its journey from t\n\nQuestion: where does the optic nerve cross the midline ​\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Duncan.\n\n Director Frank Darabont first read Stephen King's 1980 novella \"The Mist\" in the Dark Forces anthology, and originally expressed interest in directing a film adaptation for his directing debut. He instead filmed The Shawshank Redemption, also based on another King novella. In October 1994, after completing The Shawshank Redemption, Darabont reiterated his interest in filming \"The Mist\". Darabont did not immediately follow through, instead directing the 1999 film adaptation of Stephen King's The Green Mile. Darabont eventually set up a first-look deal for The Mist with Paramount Pictures, having been entrusted feature-film rights by Stephen King. By December 2004, Darabont said that he had begun writing an adapted screenplay for The Mist, and by October 2006, the project moved from Paramount to Dimension Films, with Darabont attached to direct and actor Thomas Jane in negotiations to join the cast.\n\nQuestion: who was toot toot in the green mile\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Hicks was born in Echols, Kentucky on May 29, 1927. He grew up poor living in rural western Kentucky with his mother and father, brother and two sisters. His father earned a meager living through the 1930s as an electrician for the Louisville Gas and Electric company. Billy was a victim of Polio in his early childhood years but later recovered having only a slight difference in his stance, with his left leg being shorter than the right. He attributed his success in shooting later in his professional career with his early hunting trips as a boy with his father, shooting quail in Central City Kentucky. Hicks was extremely proficient with not only the pistol and rifle but was also deadly accurate with hitting moving targets. Early jobs prior to his military and shooting careers included working part-time for the local mining company in Central City Kentucky, working above the mines and in them. Other early jobs included working for a pharmacy and delivering milk. It was his proficiency with firearms that would end up taking him farther than he ever dreamed possible.\n\n Billy Wilson was born on May 17, 1889 in Timaru to Tabitha Ann Wilson and Joseph William Wilson.

Beginning in Florence, the style spread to Rome and Venice and made the combination of dome, drum, and barrel vaults standard structural forms. Notable architects during the Italian Renaissance were Filippo Brunelleschi, builder of the dome of Florence Cathedral, Donato Bramante, Andrea Palladio, and Michelangelo, designer of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica.\n\n family member). ; The bronze balustrade columns (1597) of the presbytery designed by Jacopo Lafri and Giovanni Battista Cennini ; Putti atop the balustrade by Leonardo Marcacci ; Virgin of the Annunciation and surrounding frescoes by Alessandro Fei (Rospigliosi altar) ; Birth of Jesus attributed to either Domenico Passignano or Pietro Sorri (Chiarenzi altar) ; Passion of Christ by Giovanni Domenico Ferreri ; San Zanobi by Giovanni Bilivert in the altar of the sacristy The octagonal layout of the nave is more typical in devotional shrines, typically attended by individuals with a personal request, rather than the linear naves of churches belonging to the friars or Dominicans, where sermons to an audience were more important. The vertical red-tiled dome on the outside resembles a smaller version of Brunelleschi's dome for the Cathedral of Florence]. An inventory in 1821 listed the church as containing the following works:\n\n Perhaps the key example of early Renaissance Quattrocento Marian architecture is the Dome of Basilica of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, Italy. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV in 1436 and was the first 'octagonal' dome in history to be built without a wooden supporting frame and was the largest dome built at the time (it is still the largest masonry dome in the world). The facade of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella in Florence is another example of the beginnings of the early Renaissance. The Basilica of Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan), famous for the mural of the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci is an example of the progression of architecture beyond the Gothic period and towards the Renaissance. This period also saw unprecedented growth in venerative Marian art with the likes of Donatello, Sandro Botticelli, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Piero di Cosimo and Paolo Uccello among many others.\n\n and Agostino Sacchi (1478), in the right aisle of the northern transept, are also notable. The most important figurative complex of the cathedral is the fresco decoration on the side walls of the nave (early 16th century), portraying the Life of Mary and Christ. Different painters collaborated to its execution: the first was Boccaccio Boccaccino (with Annunciation to Joachim and Jesus with the Doctors), who, in 1506, had already painted a Redemeer with Cremona's Patron Saints in the apse vault. He was succeeded by Giovan Francesco Bembo (Epiphany and Presentation at the Temple) and Altobello Melone (Flight to Egypt, Massacre of the Innocents and the first four panels of the Passion of Christ), who both \n\n The Medici Chapel in Florence was designed by Michelangelo and built between 1521 and 1534. It contains the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo de' Medici. In 1569, the dome over the church of Madonna dell'Umiltà in Pistoia was completed by Giorgio Vasari at the behest of Cosimo I de' Medici, over a building designed and built by others. Although clearly referencing Florence Cathedral visually and in the use of two shells, structurally the octagonal dome is similar to the much earlier dome of Florence Baptistery and the hemispherical shape of Michelangelo's design for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. Cracks discovered shortly after completion necessitated the addition by Vasari of iron chains on the inside and outside, but structural problems have continued and additional chains have been added over the centuries, many outside of the dome. The instability has been attributed to Vasari's design.\n\nQuestion: who painted the ceiling of the florence cathedral\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I wasn't exactly sure what she meant. \"When I walk, especially when it's cold out, I start wheezeling,\" she explained, and then, like a caller on the radio show _Car Talk_ , she began imitating the musical sound she heard when she breathed. She was wheezing. The \"wheezeling\" sometimes woke her up at night and she would have to sit up. A couple of nights she ended up sleeping in a chair because she felt like she couldn't breathe lying down. She had no chest pain, but sometimes felt chest tightness when she took a deep breath. These episodes lasted only a few minutes. After they resolved, she told me, she felt fine. She had recently had an upper respiratory tract infection and with further questioning thought the wheeze might have started when she was sick. On exam, her blood pressure was normal.

Brazil was in the semi-finals for the first time since 2002, from which they emerged victorious and subsequently won the tournament against Germany; while Germany was in a record-breaking fourth consecutive semi-final. Both teams had entered the tournament among the favourites to win, with Germany ranked 2nd and Brazil ranked 3rd in the FIFA World Rankings.

It ran from 21 June to 13 July 2013. At the FIFA Executive Meeting in Zürich on 3 March 2011, Turkey beat other bids to host the series games, from host competition by the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. In its bid, Turkey suggested the use of thirteen stadiums in ten of its cities, before deciding in February 2012, that seven cities would play host to games. This tournament marked the first time in its history that neither Argentina nor Brazil (the most successful teams in the competition) qualified. It was also only the second time that Brazil had not taken part (the first time was the 1979 edition). France won the tournament and their first U-20 World Cup, and thus became the first nation to win all five FIFA 11-a-side men's titles (FIFA World Cup, FIFA Confederations Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, and Olympic gold medal).\n\n The FIFA World Cup is considered the most prestigious association football tournament in the world. The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, followed by Germany and Italy with four titles each; Argentina, France, and Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.

They are found in warmer coastal regions around the world, including shallow mangrove swamps, mudflats, canals, and turtle grass flats in Florida, and the Caribbean and Micronesia. The medusa usually lives upside-down on the bottom, which has earned them the common name. These jellyfish partake in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates and therefore, must lay upside-down in areas with sufficient light penetration to fuel their energy source. Where found, there may be numerous individuals with varying shades of white, blue, green and brown.\n\n 30°S with a maximum depth of 46 m, temperatures between 20 and 28 C, high salinity, and low carbon dioxide levels. Stauromedusae, although usually classified as jellyfish, are stalked, sessile animals that live in cool to Arctic waters. Cnidarians range in size from a mere handful of cells for the parasitic myxozoans through Hydra's length of 5 - 20 mm, to the Lion's mane jellyfish, which may exceed 2 m in diameter and 75 m in length. Prey of cnidarians ranges from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea \n\n in the Barents Sea, an Atlantic-influenced Arctic shelf sea, are mainly sub-Arctic species including herring, young cod, and capelin. In ice-covered regions of the central Arctic Ocean, polar cod is a central predator of primary consumers. The apex predators in the Arctic Ocean—marine mammals such as seals, whales, and polar bears—prey upon fish. Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem, and it is especially exposed to climate change, because it warms faster than the rest of the world. Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean.\n\n In 2020 researchers working off the coast of Western Australia came across an Apolemia which had coiled itself into a spiral form. The outer \"ring\" was estimated to be 47 meters (154 feet) long, with an estimated total length of 119 meters (390 feet). This would make it longer than any other animal on the planet, if one includes colonial animals, although individuals of the lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) are known to be nearly as large; the largest known specimen of the latter had tentacles as long as 37 m and was projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75 m, making it one of the longest extant non-colonial animals.\n\nThe Japanese spider crab (Arthropoda: Macrocheira kaempferi) is one of the world's largest arthropods. The Japanese spider crab is largest known species of crab and may live up to 100 years. With a leg span of that can reach four feet, it has the longest span of any arthropod. They are typically found in the Pacific waters near Japan on the bottom of the continental shelf. ; The lion's mane jellyfish (Cnidaria: Cyanea capillata) is the largest known type of jellyfish. Their tentacles can reach up to 190 feet long, and they may have a bell diameter of almost 7 feet. These animals are usually found in cold northern Arctic waters and in the Northern portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. ; The giant squid (Mollusca: Architeuthis dux) comes from the family Architeuthidae. These squid are both the largest known cephalopod and the largest known mollusc. They can grow to a length of about 45–50 feet long.

During his 15-year career in the National Football League (NFL), Johnson played for the Minnesota Vikings, Washington Redskins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Dallas Cowboys. He is perhaps best known for his time with the Buccaneers, whom he led to their Super Bowl XXXVII title over the Oakland Raiders. Johnson is also notable for being the first player in the NFL to complete a touchdown pass to himself, doing so in a 1997 game against the Carolina Panthers. He remained the only player to do so until Marcus Mariota repeated the feat in a 2018 postseason game.\n\n McCardell signed with the Tampa Buccaneers before the 2002 season. The Buccaneers would go on to win Super Bowl XXXVII, beating the AFC champion Oakland Raiders 48-21 with McCardell scoring two touchdowns in that game. He became the team's primary receiver late in the 2003 season, making his second Pro Bowl, mainly due to a dispute between receiver Keyshawn Johnson and the Buccaneers organization, which ultimately ended in Johnson being traded to the Dallas Cowboys for Joey Galloway.

That year, he broke the Buccaneers team records for passing yards with 3,406, completions with 340, and attempts with 540.

Facing political opposition from the Bolsheviks, he decided to end Russia's campaign against Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria to redirect Bolshevik energy to eliminating internal dissent. In March 1918, by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolshevik government gave Germany and the Ottoman Empire enormous territorial and economic concessions in exchange for an end to war on the Eastern Front. All of the modern-day Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) were given over to the German occupation authority Ober Ost, along with Belarus and Ukraine. Thus Germany had at last achieved its long-wanted dominance of \"Mitteleuropa\" (Central Europe) and could now focus fully on defeating the Allies on the Western Front. In practice, however, the forces that were needed to garrison and secure the new territories were a drain on the German war effort.\n\n Empire. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance. Anticipating a retaliatory declaration of war from Russia's closest western ally, France, Germany put into action the Schlieffen Plan. Under this military strategy, formulated by Count Schlieffen in 1905, Germany would launch a lightning attack on France through the poorly defended Low Countries. This would bypass France's main defences, arranged to the south. Germany's army would be able to encircle Paris, force France to surrender, and turn its full attention to the Eastern Front.\n\n In World War I, Italy was allied to France and Britain against the Central Powers, Austria-Hungary and Germany. Italy’s campaign on land against the Austrian army had been stalemated for two and a half years, with little movement, though at the cost of huge casualties. At sea, equality with the Austro-Hungarian Navy in capital ships had led to a deadlock, with neither side wishing to risk their loss; thus the war at sea in the Adriatic was a contest of small ships, of raids and patrols, of sudden actions by night, and of losses to mines and submarines. In this arena, the Italian Navy had developed a commando force of fast torpedo boats, the MAS, which attracted men with a buccaneering spirit. In November 1917 the deadlock was upset by an Austrian offensive, supported by German forces made available by the collapse of the Russian front. In the battle of Caporetto, the Italian army was defeated, and in a period of three weeks the front was pushed back 50 miles, to within striking distance of Venice.\n\n offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that ended the war of the Central Powers against Russia and Romania on the Eastern Front. Using short, intense \"hurricane\" bombardments and infiltration tactics, the German armies moved nearly 60 mi to the west, the deepest advance by either side since 1914, but the result was indecisive. The unstoppable advance of the Allied armies during the Hundred Days Offensive of 1918 caused a sudden collapse of the German armies and persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable. The German government surrendered in the Armistice of 11 November 1918, and the terms of peace were settled by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\n The Central Powers planned four offensives on their Eastern Front in early 1915. The Germans, led by Paul von Hindenburg, would attack eastward from their front line in western Poland, which had been occupied after the  Battle of Łódź in 1914, toward the Vistula River and also in East Prussia in the vicinity of the  Masurian Lakes (site of the 1914 Battle of the Masurian Lakes). The Austro-Hungarians would emerge from the Carpathian Mountain passes to attack the Russians by  driving toward Lemberg. They would be led by General Alexander von Linsingen. Further south General Borojevic von Bojna would attempt to relieve the besieged fortress at Przemyśl.

The current Salton Sea was formed when Colorado River floodwater breached an irrigation canal being constructed in the Imperial Valley in 1905 and flowed into the Salton Sink. For decades, the Sea continued to receive sufficient quantities of water from irrigation runoff and the New and Alamo rivers, providing fresher water to the Salton Sea. This lake in the desert became a favorite getaway for Hollywood stars, and the Sea was stocked with sport \n\n only in California, however, at that time the name C. luteus was applied to plants that later were named C. nuttallii A yellow-flowered Calochortus was first named as a variety of C. nuttallii but was later separated into a new species C. aureus. This species occurs in Utah today, though apparently no longer on the islands of the Great Salt Lake. Because of the Great Salt Lake's high salinity, it has few fish, but they do occur in Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay when spring runoff brings fresh water into the lake. A few aquatic animals live in the lake's main basin, including \n\n Starting in 1901, farmers in the Imperial Valley were using the Colorado River for irrigation water, with drainage water going to a very small Salton Sea. The surrounding ecosystem changed somewhat rapidly, and \"by 1929, the combination of evaporation and agricultural drainage water increased the Sea's salinity, eliminating most of the fresh water fish species.\" In addition to fish, migratory birds have long inhabited the region, and there is concern that pollutants are damaging the population. Most notably, \"salt, selenium and pesticides are carried into the sea with agricultural return flows, which originates largely from Imperial Valley farms.\" With the post-World War II population growth \n\n In the late Quaternary period, the Colorado river had at times discharged its waters into the Salton Basin, rather than the Gulf of California as it does today. This resulted in the formation of a large lake named Lake Cahuilla. The lake was a major food source for the indigenous people of the area, supporting large populations of fish and migratory birds. The Salton Sea currently occupies the lowest level of the former Lake Cahuilla. At some point, in the past few thousand years, the Colorado River stopped replenishing Lake Cahuilla, and the lake slowly dissipated. Easy access to fresh water, fish, and fowl went away with the lake. This forced \n\n The Salton Sea has few natural inlets of water, has no natural outlets, and is largely sustained by agricultural runoff from farmlands in the Imperial and Coachella Valleys. In recent decades, agricultural runoff to the Salton Sea hass diminished due to decreasing agricultural inflows, evaporation, and reduced precipitation, causing the sea to shrink and increase in salinity. High salinity levels, combined with greater concentrations of nutrients and toxins, have altered the sea's ecosystem and surrounding habitat, making it difficult for most fish and bird species to survive. The Salton Sea's diminishing size also has exposed lake bed (i.e. playa) around the sea's shoreline; this playa contains toxic substances that may circulate in the air and impair local and regional air \n\nQuestion: what kind of fish live in the salton sea\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds. ; A referee can grant time-outs to either a player or the coach. ; Two free throws and possession of the ball for a clear-path-to-the-basket foul. Previously only one free throw was awarded as well as possession. Rules are governed by standard basketball rules as defined by the NBA, with a few notable exceptions: Games are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league's original \n\nrunning with the ball, ; holding the ball with the arms or body, ; striking the ball with the fist, ; shouldering, holding, pushing, striking or tripping in any way of an opponent. Basketball has always had the concept of fouls. In 1891, James Naismith's original 13 rules defined a foul as: Only the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations. Holding the ball with the arms or body is now rare but legal. Originally, on a player's second foul, the player would be removed without substitution until the next successful goal (similar to a penalty in ice hockey). Before long, free throws were introduced, originally worth three points each, then one. Originally, any team member was allowed to shoot free throws. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws. The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see Penalties below).\n\n is continued. Under FIBA rules, a defender must be within one meter of a player holding the ball and must be in an active guarding position. This count can occur anywhere on the playing court. In the NBA this rule is applied only in a throw in scenario. A five-second count will begin if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded or starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. (The five-second count commences when the offensive player penetrates the free throw line extended.) After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession.\n\n The lane is a restricted area in which players on offense (in possession of the ball) can stay for only three seconds. At all levels of play, after three seconds the player is assessed a three-second violation which results in a turnover. In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, defending team players are allowed to stay in the key with no time limit. In American professional basketball, defending team players are prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless the player is directly guarding an offensive player. Otherwise if a defender exceeds that time, the defending team is charged with a defensive three-second violation, which results in a technical foul where the team with the ball is awarded one free throw, plus retaining possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the clock resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.\n\n sanctioned by all three associations, 16 ft wide for both NBA and FIBA keys, and 12 ft for NCAA and NAIA keys. Prior to 2006, the key in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments was a trapezoidal shape. The most-commonly enforced rule on the key is the \"three seconds rule\" in which the team of a player on offense who stays on the key for more than three seconds loses possession of the ball. Another rule is the lane violation which occurs if a player from either team enters the key before a free-throw shooter releases the ball in the act of shooting. A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player.\n\nQuestion: when was the defensive 3 second rule implemented\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Each of the eight spans is 100 ft long. The legs are made up of Barlow rails which are riveted together; one of the rails separates from the main support close to the deck at the top, forming a transverse truss joining a rail from the opposite leg of the pier and longitudinal bracing is provided by further rails. The supporting piles, which are made of cast iron, are 2 ft in diameter at the seabed. In total approximately 370 tons of wrought iron was used. The Severn \n\n granted a million pounds towards the restoration, with smaller sums from Woodspring District Council and other funding bodies. The trust, which had been formed by the preservation society, also obtained a 99-year lease. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986.

The lowest of the three tiers is almost permanently underwater except for the lowest tide and has become disused. A notice announces that it is the same length as the RMS Titanic, but that ship was over 100 ft shorter. The pier is a popular sport fishing venue. In 2018, the pier underwent restoration at a cost of £500,000, in addition to installing more than 300 m of gas mains supply, as the pier's own gas supply had developed problems. Refurbishment works included resurfacing, replacement and repainting of railings and an upgrade to the drainage system. The works coincided with the 60 year anniversary of the pier's official opening.\n\n Clevedon Pier is a seaside pier in the town of Clevedon, Somerset, England on the east shore of the Severn Estuary.

The pier was built during the 1860s to attract tourists and provide a ferry port for rail passengers to South Wales. The pier is 312 m long and consists of eight spans supported by steel rails covered by wooden decking, with a pavilion on the pier head. The pier opened in 1869 and served as an embarkation point for paddle steamer excursions for almost 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund raising and heritage grants allowed the pier to be dismantled for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the National Piers Society, and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.\n\n Yarmouth Pier is a Victorian pleasure pier, located in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. It is the longest wooden pier in England, and frequently requires restoration due to the relatively short lifespan of the wooden piles. Following its latest restoration scheme, it reopened to the public in 2008. After 140 years of operation, it continues to thrive as a tourist attraction.\n\nQuestion: what is the longest pier in the uk\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He makes an \"I promise you the world\"-type vow that he will come back in two weeks with a ring of gold, and proves it by giving Cora a ring he made out of straw. But when Jonathan tells Cora that he has to leave the next day, Cora decides that she is going to sleep with him that evening.

In the show's second season, it is revealed that the Queen of Hearts is, in fact, Cora (Barbara Hershey) the mother of the Wicked Witch of the West and the Evil Queen. In her earlier life, Cora (portrayed by Rose McGowan) was also the miller's daughter (the heroine of the Rumpelstiltskin story). Cora abandons her first born, Zelena, after realising that the father is not royalty as she believed.

Eva then tells Leopold to check Cora's pockets, which he discovers is laced with jewelry she had planned to deliver to Johnathan. Cora is then escorted out of the palace and Eva consoles Leopold, promising that she'll be able to give him an heir that is pure as snow after they are married. Months later, Cora gives birth to Zelena and afterwards leaves her near a tree, telling her daughter that because she is a miller's daughter she can't give her the life she always wanted.

As Leopold and Cora start to bond together, this eventually leads the two to get engaged. However, this union would start to unravel when Jonathan visits Cora in the gazebo and threatens to blackmail her because she hid the truth about the unborn baby and he has become greedy by using her. Cora decides to buy his silence by giving him riches in return, not knowing that Eva, who just arrived to the palace, has been eavesdropping on their conversation.

He was the second quarterback selected from the Pac-10 conference after the Cincinnati Bengals selected Carson Palmer from USC with the first overall pick. He started the first 9 games of the season, going 5–3, before being injured (thigh) in a game against the St. Louis Rams. He was inactive for most of the rest of the season, being replaced by backup Anthony Wright, as he also had to have surgery to repair a muscle in his quadriceps.

The pick was used to select Martez Wilson. Brown was made the starting right tackle of the offensive line. At the end of 2010 season, he played in 15 games and started 14 of them. On July 31, 2011, the Redskins re-signed Brown to a five-year, $20.25 million contract. As with the 2010 season, he was hampered by the hip surgery he received in 2009.

It was the second game-winning drive of Cousins' career, the first being Week 14 of the 2012 season against the Baltimore Ravens, when he entered the game in relief of the injured Robert Griffin III. This win was also Cousins' first division win, after previously going 0–5 against the Cowboys, Giants, and Eagles. With the win the Redskins moved to 2–2 for the season. Cousins threw zero interceptions for the second consecutive home game, a first in his career, and the Redskins defense did not allow a 40-yard rusher for the second straight week.\n\n During the off-season, there was much speculation that the Rams would select Heisman Trophy winner and former Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III. But new head coach Jeff Fisher instilled hope that Bradford was still the Rams franchise quarterback, solidifying this hope when the Rams later reached a deal with the Washington Redskins for the 2nd overall selection in the 2012 NFL Draft. The Rams were not expected to make much of a leap following their dismal campaign the year before, but behind strong play by Bradford and rookies stepping up to the challenge, the Rams finished 7-8-1. In Week 2, against the Washington Redskins, he finished with 310 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–28 victory. In Week 15, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had 377 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 36–22 loss. Bradford finished the season with career best numbers: 3,702 passing yards, 21 touchdowns compared to 13 interceptions and an 82.6 passer rating to go along with 59.5 completion percentage.\n\n They proceeded to select Robert Griffin III, after the Indianapolis Colts selected Andrew Luck from Stanford University with the 1st overall pick.

In 1874 a version of the song was collected and published by the Hampton Institute indicating that it was sung by a child in slavery who was being separated from his mother. The song describes \"'the marriage feast of the Lamb referred to in the New Testament Book of Revelation.

Wright's version was produced by James Stroud, who also produced Walker's version, and Lynn Peterzell. In 1993, Walker opened for George Strait and Alan Jackson and he stated in an interview with Billboard \"I'm real grateful for the opportunity to open for those guys\", with only one hit record, it's hard to keep the audience's attention for 45 minutes, but it's working. I'm surprised, but lately when I go out there, they're going bonkers.\" After the single hit the number one position, Walker stated \"It used to be that having your song go No. 1 meant a certain degree of success. Now, there are so many acts who do it, you just gotta go right back out and do it again.\" In another interview, Walker said, \"Having a No. 1 hit doesn't mean you're making any more money that you did a few years ago.\"\n\n Talkin' Blues\" is to leave the means to peace open to interpretation: we cannot be sure if he advocates early withdrawal or peace through victory. By promoting peace — something every side in the political debate wanted — but not specifying how he feels that peace should be achieved, Johnny Cash manages to deliver a deeply personal story of a singer traveling to a dangerous foreign land, a plea for support of U.S. troops fighting abroad, whether they should have been sent there or not, all with a message of peace that all sides could interpret as supporting their view.\"\n\n 'Bout Me Baby / Where Do You Go To Go Away / Big Grey City / Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out / What-cha Gonna Do / I Used To Live Here / The Sunny Song / St. Louis Is A Long Way Away / Little Poppa / O Freedom ; The Many Faces of Gale Garnett (1965) ; Track listing: Won't You Be My Lover / Excuse Me Mister / As Much As I Can / Marionette / Ain't Gonna Stay In Love Alone / God Bless The Child / Settle Down / The Question Song / Long Time Blues / \n\n suggests that the only thing needed is \"cool, clear water.\" According to authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen, the lyrics don't \"make much literal sense but somehow sound right on an intuitive level.\" Music critic Johnny Rogan finds the mood of the song to be \"stoical rather than despairing\" and describes the lyrics as laissez-faire. The song is in the form of a ballad, with some country music influence. Jesse Ed Davis' guitar contributes to the country atmosphere. Musically, it reproduces some of the sound from Lennon's Imagine album in employing dual pianos, one played by Lennon and one played by Nicky Hopkins. Urish and Bielen describe the music as \"mournful and relaxed.\" John Blaney claims that it captures \"an atmosphere of listless intoxication.\" Music journalist Paul du Noyer believes that Charlie Patton's \"Ain't Goin' Down That Dirt Road\" may have been an influence on the song.\n\nQuestion: who sings that aint no way to go\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He also led the team with 4.3 assists per game, 46.8% three-point shooting accuracy, and 97 steals. His 97 steals tied the school's single season record, a record that he set as a sophomore. He scored 30 points in Kansas' win in the Big 12 Conference tournament title game against Texas. Chalmers was again named to the Big 12 All-Defensive Team, and earned second-team All-Big 12 honors. Chalmers helped his team win the 2008 NCAA Championship with a three-point shot with 2.1 seconds left in the final game. His three just before the end of regulation brought the game into overtime, where Kansas took over and defeated the Memphis Tigers, led by phenom freshman Derrick Rose. Chalmers was named Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. It was the Jayhawks' fifth national title (including two pre-tournament titles in 1922 and 1923).

Despite losing 8 players, 5 who received substantial playing time, from the previous season, the Jayhawks still entered the season ranked 5th in the AP and Coaches poll, due in large part to a recruiting class ranked in the top 10 by Scout (4th), Rivals \n\n In 2005, Beck returned to the college football coaching arena by accepting the position of wide receivers coach at the University of Kansas. The Jayhawks had been struggling for consistency, posting no conference wins in 2002, losing the bowl game in their 6–7 campaign of 2003, and missing bowl eligibility in the 4–7 season of 2004. Beck's receivers helped the 2005 Kansas team to a 7–5 record and their first bowl win since 1995. In 2006, four different Jayhawks receivers caught 24 or more passes, though the 6–6 team was not extended a bowl invitation. In 2007 Beck was also appointed as the Passing Game Coordinator at Kansas, and the season proved to be a breakthrough year for the Jayhawks. Kansas finished 12–1 with the second-best scoring offense nationally, shared the Big 12 Conference North division title with Missouri, and secured a final #7 ranking in both the AP and Coaches polls with their 24–21 win over #5 Virginia Tech in the 2008 Orange Bowl.\n\n Wiggins committed to Kansas on May 14, 2013.

Wiggins averaged 17.1 points per game (ppg), 5.9 rebounds per game (rpg), and made 34.1% of his three-pointers in his freshman year at Kansas. On January 22, 2014, Wiggins was named a Top 25 Finalist for the John R. Wooden Men's Player of the Year award by the Los Angeles Athletic Club.

It has a vast and diverse geography famous for its deep canyons, high- and low-elevation deserts, numerous natural rock formations, and volcanic mountain ranges. Arizona shares land borders with Utah to the north, the Mexican state of Sonora to the south, New Mexico to the east, and Nevada to the northwest, as well as water borders with California and the Mexican state of Baja California to the southwest along the Colorado River. Arizona is also one of the Four Corners states and is diagonally adjacent to Colorado. Arizona has a total area of 113998 sqmi, making it the sixth largest U.S. state. Of this area, just 0.32% consists of water, which makes Arizona the state with the second lowest percentage of water area (New Mexico is the lowest at 0.19%). Arizona spans about 335 mi at its widest and 390 mi at its longest, and has an average elevation of about 4000 ft.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the state of Texas has experienced strong population growth. Texas has many major cities and metropolitan areas, along with many towns and rural areas. Much of the population is concentrated in the major cities of Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, and El Paso, and their corresponding metropolitan areas.\n\n Texas passed New York State in the 1990s to become the second-largest U.S. state in population, after California. The state is also the most populous state in the South Central United States, and the most populous state in the South. Texas' population growth between 2000 and 2010 represents the highest population increase, by number of people, for any U.S. state during this time period. The large population increase can somewhat be attributed to Texas' relative insulation from the U.S. housing bubble. At the 2020 United States census it was reported that Texas had a resident population of 29,145,505, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 U.S. census. Its apportioned population in 2020 was 29,183,290.

About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

There arose several technical issues, such as the tarpauline cover blowing away in a storm on the day before the winners were to be announced, the reels of Alfred Hitchcock’s Notorious shown in reverse order, and Miguel M. Delgado’s The Three Musketeers projected upside-down. During the first festival, the jury was made up of one representative per country, with French historian Georges Huisman as the Jury President. With more emphasis on creativity than in competitiveness, eighteen nations presented their films. Eleven of them tied for the first Grand Prix of the International Festival.\n\n The 15th Cannes Film Festival was held from 7 to 23 May 1962.

The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings \"Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn\", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing \"By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way\". Perry commented on the lyrics: \"[They] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me \n\n such as \"Sick all the time, I miss my wife / I quit / Got better things to do with my life / I quit\". Aukerman explained of the song: I can't even count the number of times I've quit this band, dating back to 1982 and Milo Goes to College! Like most of my songs, \"I Quit\" is my attempt to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! So there is no \"message\" to the song, just me spewing about the negative aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to quit. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, \"I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me.\"\n\n were driving to the studio.

The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: \"There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends.\" For the refrains, she speaks of setting fire to photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, \"As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn\". About.com found the song's theme to be feminism.\n\n had a song that had a dance to it, they did. And I thought, \"Wow, good idea.\" So I wrote the lyrics as a parody and I wrote it as a joke. I didn't even think that we were going to use it. If you read the lyrics, they're kind of silly. I'm thinking, you know, here we are, this totally hard thrash band, we kick in your face and rape and murder your wife, and now here we're writing a parody of a '60s or '50s dance number.

However, in October 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron said that the squadron's disbandment and reformation would be put on hold to allow Tornados to continue supporting strikes against ISIS. As a consequence of this new plan, the new No. 2 Squadron formed at Lossiemouth on 12 January 2015, with the old No. 2 Squadron at Marham being re-designated as No. 12 Squadron on 9 January. During October and November 2016, four No. 2 Squadron Typhoons and support personnel deployed to \n\n Pentland, RAF Chaplain in Chief. The squadron has deployed on several occasions to maintain the Tornado GR4 detachment in Afghanistan. It also saw action over Libya during Operation Ellamy/Operation Unified Protector for which it received a further battle honour. The Squadron also operated eight aircraft from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus as part of Operation Shader, the coalition strikes against the extremist group ISIS. In August 2014, the squadron deployed three Tornados equipped with the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod and the Litening III targeting pod to N'Djamena in Chad for Operation Turus, to take part in the search for Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram.\n\n 27 September 2014, the first armed sortie took place over Iraq. A pair of Tornado GR4s left Cyprus armed with laser-guided bombs, supported by a Voyager aerial refueling tanker. Ultimately, the aircraft did not locate any targets requiring immediate air attack and so gathered intelligence for coalition forces instead. The Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted its first airstrike on 30 September 2014. A pair of Tornado GR4s engaged an ISIL heavy weapon position and an armed pickup truck using a laser-guided bomb and air-to-surface missile. On 3 October 2014, the RAF deployed two additional Tornado aircraft to bring its deployed fleet up to eight aircraft. During the same month, it was also \n\n In February 2006 Air Forces Monthly suggested that the eventual Eurofighter order may reach 100 and the deal could include the upgrade of the RSAF's Tornado IDS aircraft, likely similar to the RAF's Tornado GR4 standard. In an editorial the magazine also raises the prospect of a requirement for a new lead-in fighter trainer to replace the earlier generation of Hawk 65/65As and to provide adequate training for transition of pilots to the advanced Typhoon. BAE System's 2005 Interim Report noted that three RSAF Tornado IDS' arrived at their Warton facility for design evaluation tests with the ultimate aim being \"to improve serviceability, address obsolescence, and enhance and sustain the capability of the aircraft\".

In addition to airstrikes, the United Kingdom has also made significant contributions towards the coalition's ISTAR capabilities. The Royal Air Force has deployed Sentinel R1, Sentry AEW1, RC-135W Rivet Joint and Shadow R1 aircraft to gather surveillance, in addition to Tornado GR4 and MQ-9 Reaper strike aircraft.

Many feminine nouns are regular but many masculine and neuter nouns are not. For example, some plurals are formed with an n or en, some with an umlaut and an e, other plurals are the same as the singular, and some add er or an umlaut and er. Many loanwords as well as some dialectal or colloquial nouns, take a plural in s (e.g. das Restaurant → die Restaurants). Some foreign endings, such as Latin -um, are deleted before the plural ending (e.g. das Zentrum → die Zentren). Sometimes the stress in the plural form is changed, for example der Muslim → die Muslime. Special colloquial or dialectal plural forms also exist. For example, Stöcker is often used as the plural of Stock \"stick\" in northern Germany, whereas the standard plural is Stöcke.\n\n German grammar is the set of structural rules of the German language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages. Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses. German has retained many of the grammatical distinctions that some Germanic languages have lost in whole or in part. There are three genders and four cases, and verbs are conjugated for person and number. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. \n\n for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative); three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter); and two numbers (singular, plural). It has strong and weak verbs. The majority of its vocabulary derives from the ancient Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, while a smaller share is partly derived from Latin and Greek, along with fewer words borrowed from French and Modern English. German is a pluricentric language; the three standardized variants are German, Austrian, and Swiss Standard High German. It is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects, with many varieties existing in Europe and other parts of the world. Some of these non-standard varieties have become recognized and protected by regional or national governments.\n\n example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely -e for the first-person singular, -st for the informal second-person singular, -t for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and -en for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural. Owing to the gender and case distinctions, the articles have more possible forms. In addition, some prepositions combine with some of the articles. Numerals are similar to other Germanic languages. Unlike modern English, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Faroese, units are placed before tens as in Early Modern English, Danish, Dutch, Yiddish and Frisian.\n\n German verbs may be classified as either weak, if they form their past tense with a dental consonant inflection, or strong, if they exhibit a vowel gradation (ablaut). Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. However, textbooks often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, and there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak.\n\nQuestion: how many strong verbs are there in german\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song was later made famous by Luke Kelly, Ronnie Drew and The Dubliners in the late 1960s, and was revived for a new audience by Irish rock band the Pogues on their 1984 album Red Roses for Me. The song has become also a football chant, sung by fans of the Dublin Bohemian Football Club whose ground is near the prison.

Trust is the expectation of someone’s help. It does not constitute a separate virtue, but is an essential condition of the virtue of hope, and an integral part of the virtues of fortitude and generosity. Because trust springs from faith, it strengthens hope and love, and is, moreover, linked up, in one way or another, with the moral virtues. It may, therefore, be called the basis on which the theological virtues unite with the moral. The moral virtues, originally natural, become supernatural if we practice them with trust in God’s help.\"\n\nAny couple getting professional help will benefit from knowing and using tapping in sessions and at home.Ultimately, you have to deal with your own reactions as best you possibly can (think tolerance and patience).Used in this context it provides the most gratifying professional results, as far as I am concerned. It is also true that those who suffer the most are predisposed by virtue of their makeup and prior life experiences, and those other life traumas also respond to more extensive treatment and therapy. One day I hope meridian-based therapies will be accepted and used for sufferers everywhere; unfortunately, the evidence base for wider medical acceptance is, as yet, insufficient. After so many successful outcomes, notably including that of treating the trauma of my eldest daughter, I am not waiting for that day for formal approval to continue this work. Treating minor variations of PTSD (not conforming to the strict definition), which can be quite debilitating for the patient, is also very rewarding. Among the common traumatic situations I have used it for are:\n\n  * For the new mother, after a difficult birth experience. * After minor car accidents (ideally used as soon as possible). * Losing a job. * Divorce and readjustment. * Parent's reaction to the severe illness/disability of a child. * Court appearances, especially being cross-examined. * Examination fears and \"freezing\" in examinations. * Being bullied in any way. * Helping carers (especially those caring for people with dementia) avoid burnout. **Relationship Problems**\n\nSome comics say that relationship and trauma are the same thing. Certainly, using tapping as \"first aid\" for the hurt and upset of dealing with the dark side of your partner's behavior is a good beginning if you wish to avoid having primitive reactions that fail miserably to resolve problems.

British journalist James Bartholomew claims to have originated the modern usage of the term \"virtue signalling,\" in a 2015 Spectator article. His 2015 formulation described virtue signaling as empty boasting (directly or otherwise): \"No one actually has to do anything. Virtue comes from mere words or even from silently held beliefs. There was a time in the distant past when people thought you could only be virtuous by doing things... involve effort and self-sacrifice.\" Merriam-Webster editor Emily Brewster describes virtue signalling as an academic-sounding counterpart to the term humblebrag, a term coined by Harris Wittels in 2010.\n\n wait for what is desired ; Perseverance - ability to work steadily despite setbacks or difficulties ; Persistence - ability to continue or repeat a task in order to achieve a goal ; Virtues of regard ; Fair-mindedness - concern that all get their due (including oneself) in cooperative arrangements of mutual benefit ; Tolerance - willingness to allow others to lead a life based on a certain set of beliefs differing from one's own ; Truthfulness/Honesty - telling someone what you know to be true in the context of a direct inquiry ; Virtues of respect ; Respect - regard for the worth of others ; Self respect - regard \n\n According to his essay, \"Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick\", in Christians Among the Virtues, he said that Christians are called to be patient patients in sickness and in health because \"patience is integral to the Christian life\". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. \"In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity.\" He also says that God showed us the best example of patience when it comes \n\nQuestion: where does patience is a virtue come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As the population and housing grew, the first palace was built during the 5th century under the reign of Pope Symmachus (498–514). Under the Holy Roman Empire, the Papal States grew to include a large portion of central Italy. But since the unification of Italy in the mid-19th century, Vatican City is the only papal state that has survived. As of 1929, because of the Lateran Treaty, the Vatican is recognized as its own independent state, the smallest in the world in population and land size, with a population of just over 800 people in July 2011. The Pope is not only the head of the Catholic religion but also head of state for Vatican City. Since the Vatican is located in Italy, the main language of the Vatican state (or Vatican City) is Italian.\n\n the 25,000,000 inhabitants of Italy at the time of unification, natural birth and death rates, without emigration, there would have been a population of about 65,000,000 by 1970. Instead, because of emigration earlier in the century, there were only 54,000,000. The overall description of the phenomenon is as follows: The 2016 Italian constitutional referendum provided data on the number of registered Italian citizens living outside Italy by country. The highest number is in Argentina, with 673,238 registered Italians residing in the country in 2016, followed by Germany with 581,433, Switzerland with 482,539, France with 329,202, Brazil with 325,555, the UK with 232,932, Belgium 225,801, the United States with 218,407, Canada with 122,262, Australia with 120,791, and Spain with 118,879.\n\nEngland – The population of England, around 1.5 million or more in 1086, is estimated to have grown to somewhere between 3.7 million and 5–7 million, although the 14th-century estimates derive from sources after the first plague epidemics, and the estimates for pre-plague population depends on assumed plague mortality, the proportion of children and the rate of omissions in returns of taxable population. ; Italy – Italy’s population around 1300 has been variously estimated at between 10 and 13 million. ; France – In 1328, France is believed to have supported between 13.4 million people (in a smaller geographical area than today’s) and 18 to 20 \n\n  Until September 1870, the city of Rome had been controlled by the pope as part of his Papal States. When King Victor Emmanuel II seized the city in 1870, Pope Pius IX refused to recognize the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. Because he could not travel without effectively acknowledging the authority of the king, Pius IX and his successors each claimed to be a \"Prisoner in the Vatican\", unable to leave the 0.44 km2 papal enclave once they had ascended the papal thrones. The impasse was resolved in 1929 by the Lateran Treaties negotiated by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini between King Victor Emmanuel III and Pope Pius XI. Under this treaty, the Vatican was recognized as an independent state, with the Pope as its head. The Vatican City State has its own citizenship, diplomatic corps, flag, and postage stamps. With a population of less than 1,000 (mostly clergymen), it is by far the smallest sovereign country in the world.\n\n Malta, the smallest EU member state, includes around 0.1% of the total EU population. Maltese voters elect 6 MEPs (5 until 2011) to the European Parliament, or one every 69,342 voters - the lowest population-per-seat ratio in the EU, 10 times smaller than the EU average (680,000) and 20 times smaller than the largest European Parliament constituency. Malta is thus the extreme case in the curve of the regressive proportionality function that allocates European Parliament seats to EU Member States constituencies. European elections in Malta are held according to the single transferable vote (STV) system, consistently with domestic electoral systems and with EU standards requiring proportional representation and use either the list system or STV.\n\nQuestion: which country has the smallest population in europe\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was one of the founders and the first permanent president of the All-India Muslim League (AIML). His goal was the advancement of Muslim agendas and protection of Muslim rights in India. The League, until the late 1930s, was not a large organisation but represented the landed and commercial Muslim interests of the British-ruled 'United Provinces' (as of today Uttar Pradesh). He shared Sir Syed Ahmad Khan's belief that Muslims should first build up their social capital through advanced education before engaging in politics. Aga Khan called on the British Raj to consider Muslims to be a separate nation within India, the so-called 'Two Nation Theory'. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas. He was nominated to represent India to the League of Nations in 1932 and served as President of the League of Nations from 1937 to 1938.\n\n of the Muslim League's position on self-government, confident that it would differ greatly from that of the Congress. To come up with such a position, the League's Working Committee met for four days in February 1940 to set out terms of reference to a constitutional sub-committee. The Working Committee asked that the sub-committee return with a proposal that would result in \"independent dominions in direct relationship with Great Britain\" where Muslims were dominant. On 6 February, Jinnah informed the Viceroy that the Muslim League would be demanding partition instead of the federation contemplated in the 1935 Act. The Lahore Resolution (sometimes called \n\n \"Pakistan Resolution\", although it does not contain that name), based on the sub-committee's work, embraced the Two-Nation Theory and called for a union of the Muslim-majority provinces in the northwest of British India, with complete autonomy. Similar rights were to be granted to the Muslim-majority areas in the east, and unspecified protections given to Muslim minorities in other provinces. The resolution was passed by the League session in Lahore on 23 March 1940. Gandhi's reaction to the Lahore Resolution was muted; he called it \"baffling\", but told his disciples that Muslims, in common with other people of India, had the right to \n\n  The Muslim League held its annual session at Minto Park in Lahore, Punjab, that lasted from 23 to 25 March 1940. During this event, the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and other Founding Fathers narrated the events regarding the differences between Hindus and Muslims, and introduced the historical resolution that cemented the formation of a nation-state in South Asia as Pakistan, even though it did not actually mention Pakistan at all. The resolution was moved by Abul Kashem Fazlul Huq (Abul Kashem Fozlul Hôk) (26 October 1873 – 27 April 1962), often called Sher-e-BangaL, passed on 24 March and had its signatures from the Founding Fathers of Pakistan. It reads as: \"[Quoting Resolution:] No constitutional plan would be workable or acceptable to the Muslims unless geographical \n\n in Lahore Jail. The most important session of the All India Muslim League, later the Pakistan Muslim League, the premier party fighting for Indian independence and the creation of Pakistan, was held in Lahore in 1940. Muslims under the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam demanded a separate homeland for Muslims of India in a document known as the Pakistan Resolution or the Lahore Resolution. During this session, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, leader of the league, publicly proposed the Two Nation Theory for the first time. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Lahore District.\n\nQuestion: where was held the first session of muslim league\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The series was originally intended to be a trilogy (named the \"Inheritance Trilogy\") until Paolini announced on October 30, 2007, while working on the third novel, that he believed the story was too complex to conclude in just three books.

There can also be synergies between products such that offering a range of products gives the consumer a more desirable product offering than would a single product. Economies of scope can also operate through distribution efficiencies—i.e. it can be more efficient to ship to any given location a range of products than a single type of product. Further economies of scope occur when there are cost savings arising from byproducts in the production process, such as when the benefits of heating from energy production has a positive effect on agricultural yields.\n\n  In the simplest mathematical formulation of this problem, two inputs are used (often labor and capital), and the optimization problem seeks to minimize the total cost (amount spent on factors of production, say labor and physical capital) subject to achieving a given level of output, as illustrated in the graph. Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an isocost curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that isocost curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle isoquant, the lowest cost can be obtained by using amounts of labor and capital such \n\n  From a starting point on the frontier, if there is no increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods.

Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.

The shock was located in the area between Olympia and Tacoma, and was felt throughout the state, as well as parts of Oregon, British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. It is the largest recorded earthquake to occur in the Puget Sound region of Washington. Eight people were killed, a minimum of 64 people were injured, and the total damage is estimated at $25 million.\n\n The 1949 Queen Charlotte Islands earthquake was caused by a rupture on the Queen Charlotte Fault, which forms part of the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. This fault runs from northern Vancouver Island, west of the Queen Charlotte Islands, up to the Gulf of Alaska. The earthquake ruptured the fault for a distance more than 500 km. Because this quake occurred before the modern surface wave magnitude scale was developed and widely implemented, this earthquake may have only had the same overall intensity as the 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake. In future there may be some research done to compare the two earthquake events. This earthquake, larger than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, is Canada's largest earthquake recorded by seismometers. However, the greatest earthquake in Canadian history was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, a megathrust earthquake that occurred along the Pacific Northwest coast from Northern California to southwestern British Columbia which reached magnitude 9 on the Richter magnitude scale.\n\n Atwater has spent much of his career studying the likelihood of large earthquakes and tsunamis in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. In 2005, he published a book with others, \"The Orphan Tsunami of 1700,\" that summarizes the evidence for an 8.7–9.2 megathrust earthquake in the Pacific Northwest on 26 January 1700, known as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The earthquake produced a tsunami so large that contemporary reports in Japan noted it, allowing Atwater's team to assign a precise date and approximate magnitude to the earthquake. Its occurrence and size are confirmed by evidence of a dramatic drop in the elevation of Northwest coastal land, recorded by buried marsh and forest soils that underlie tidal sediment, the deposition of a layer of tsunami sand on the subsided landscape, the death or injury of affected trees (see dendrochronology), and descriptions of the earthquake and tsunami in regional Amerindian legends.\n\n Damaging earthquakes are well known in the Pacific Northwest, including several larger than magnitude 7, most notably the M9 1700 Cascadia earthquake and the M7.0–7.3 earthquake in about 900AD on the Seattle Fault. The M6.5 1965 Puget Sound earthquake shook the Seattle, Washington area, causing substantial damage and seven deaths. This event spurred the installation of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network in 1969 to monitor regional earthquake activity. Early in 1980 PNSN scientists detected unrest under Mt. St. Helens and by March 1980 predicted an eruption was likely to occur \"soon\". On March 27th the first steam and ash explosion occurred. The PNSN expanded to better monitor Mt. St. Helens and other Cascade Volcanos leading up to the deadly May 18 eruption and in the years following.\n\n The last known great earthquake in the northwest was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Geological evidence indicates that great earthquakes (> magnitude 8.0) may have occurred sporadically at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, suggesting a return time of about 500 years. Seafloor core evidence indicates that there have been forty-one subduction zone earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 10,000 years, suggesting a general average earthquake recurrence interval of only 243 years. Of these 41, nineteen have produced a \"full margin rupture\", wherein the entire fault opens up. By comparison, similar subduction zones in the world usually have such earthquakes every 100 to 200 years; the longer interval here may indicate unusually large stress buildup and subsequent unusually large earthquake slip. There is also evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake. One strong line of evidence for these earthquakes is convergent timings for fossil damage from tsunamis in the Pacific Northwest and historical Japanese records of tsunamis. The next rupture of the Cascadia Subduction Zone is anticipated to be capable of causing widespread destruction throughout the Pacific Northwest.\n\nQuestion: what is the largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the pacific northwest\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Due to production delays, the Big Three networks initially targeted premieres for their scripted series within the year, but with no specific dates set. With the steady resumption of production, the networks began to set premiere dates from late-October through mid-November. Some of NBC's fall programming, as well as all of Fox and The CW's fall scripted programming, was deferred to midseason premieres in 2021. Due to their quicker turnaround time in comparison to scripted series, production of non-scripted programs (including game shows and reality shows) were also expedited by networks to fill gaps in their lineups. With the delayed premieres and increased production costs due to safety protocols, it was reported that scripted dramas would likely not air full 22-episode seasons, with CBS having already reduced orders for CBS Studios' dramas and sitcoms to either 16 or 18 episodes in October 2020, and negotiating similar reductions for series from other studios.\n\n has been re-broadcast across Japan on various television networks such as TBS, Kids Station, MBS and BS-i from April onwards.

She meets the girls at Spencer's barn and slips \n\n \"A' Is for Answers\" is the twenty-fourth episode of the fourth season and the ninety-fifth episode of the ABC Family mystery drama series Pretty Little Liars. The episode, serving as the fourth-season finale and the winter finale, was broadcast on March 18, 2014. It was directed and written by I. Marlene King. In the episode, the girls finally meet up with Alison in Philadelphia and learn from her about everything that happened the night she disappeared. Meanwhile, the girls' parents are scrambling to find them and the police bring Spencer's family in for questioning, thinking that she may have killed the girl in Alison's grave. A' Is for Answers\" premiered to an audience of 3.12 million viewers, up from the previous episode, and garnered a 1.3 rating in the 18-49 demographic. It also generated over 1.45 million tweets during its broadcast, becoming the most-tweeted episode of 2014 and the four most tweeted broadcast in television history. The episode received a general positive response from television critics, with calling it a \"satisfying and surprising finale.\" Some critics, however, were dismayed by the questions surrounding the series' main plotline not being answered.\n\n \"Game Over, Charles\" is the tenth episode of the sixth season of the ABC Family mystery drama series Pretty Little Liars, serving as the mid-season finale. It is the 130th episode, overall, originally airing on August 11, 2015, on ABC Family. It was written and directed by showrunner I. Marlene King. ABC Family promoted the finale with the slogan \"#facetoface\", which served as an indication that the mysterious villain \"A\" would be revealed in the mid-season finale. In the episode, Alison, Aria, Emily, Hanna, Spencer and Mona finally uncover the true identity of \"A,\" who turns out to be CeCe Drake, and they learn why she has been tormenting them. In addition, the episode includes a time jump, as the Liars return to Rosewood after being away for five years. \"Game Over, Charles\" was watched by 3.09 million viewers and garnered a 1.4 rating, making it the most-watched episode of the sixth season, and the most-watched episode since the fourth season finale 'A' Is for Answers,\" up from the previous episode.\n\nQuestion: who is the head a in pretty little liars\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources and innovation to impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. “Human beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. If humans were to devise products, tools, furniture, homes, factories, and cities more intelligently from the start, they wouldn't even need to think in terms of waste, or contamination, or scarcity. Good design would allow for abundance, endless reuse, and pleasure.” - The Upcycle by authors Michael Braungart and William McDonough, 2013. Design-related decisions are happening everywhere on a daily basis, impacting “sustainable development” or provisioning for the needs of future generations of life on earth. Sustainability and design are intimately linked. Quite simply, our future is designed. The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future.\n\n is a staple of sustainable living practices. Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice. Lester R. Brown, a prominent environmentalist and founder of the Worldwatch Institute and Earth Policy Institute, describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as \"shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system.\" Derrick Jensen (\"the poet-philosopher of the ecological movement\"), a celebrated American author, radical environmentalist and prominent critic of mainstream environmentalism argues that \"industrial civilization is not and can never be sustainable\". From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.\n\n Our Common Future, also known as the Brundtland Report, was published on October 1987 by the United Nations through the Oxford University Press. This publication was in recognition of Gro Harlem Brundtland's, former Norwegian Prime Minister, role as Chair of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED). Its targets were multilateralism and interdependence of nations in the search for a sustainable development path. The report sought to recapture the spirit of the Stockholm Conference which had introduced environmental concerns to the formal political development sphere. Our Common Future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda; it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue. The document was the culmination of a \"900-day\" international exercise which catalogued, analysed, and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from \"senior government representatives, scientists and experts, research institutes, industrialists, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and the general public\" held at public hearings throughout the world. The report defined 'sustainable development' as \"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\".\n\n Defined by the United Nations Environment Programme as \"development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,\" sustainable development may be considered together with the concepts of \"integration\" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and \"interdependence\" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent). Laws mandating environmental impact assessment and requiring or encouraging development to minimize environmental impacts may be assessed against this principle. The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN Earth Summit resulted in the Rio Declaration, Principle 3 of which reads: \"The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations.\" Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).\n\n approaches to construction, aiming to seek harmony with nature. The concept of sustainable construction was born out of sustainable development discourse. The term sustainable development was first coined in the Brundtland report of 1987, defined as the ability to meet the needs of all people in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. This report defined a turning point in sustainability discourse since it deviated from the earlier limits-to-growth perspective to focus more on achieving social and economic milestones, and their connection to environmental goals, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable development interconnects three socially concerned systems—environment, society and economy—a system seeking to achieve a range of goals \n\nQuestion: when did the term sustainability start to be used\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

CWD is widely thought to be caused by an abnormally-folded protein called a prion; the folding makes it infectious. The prions collect in the brain, causing small holes to form and resulting in, among other symptoms, repetitive movement, teeth grinding, excessive salivation and substantial weight loss. More recently, it has been suggested that CWD may infact be caused by infection with the bacteria Spiroplasma, although supporting studies are lacking. TB, by contrast, is a bacterial infection of the respiratory system. CWD is a significant problem in the USA, where many deer are killed each year. Red deer, and possibly other species, are considered maintenance hosts for TB and this may have important consequences for activities aimed at tackling the disease in cattle.\nChronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a disorder of the nervous system and one of several diseases that we call Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE’s). The TSEs include diseases of sheep such as scrapie and the infamous ‘mad cow disease’ (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), a variant of which is suspected to cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in humans. CWD is similar to BSE and scrapie, but affects only cervids (deer and elk).\nThe cause of CWD was has remained frustratingly elusive, with suggestions of bacteria or an unconventional incomplete virus called a “virino” as culprits. Recently, Frank Bastiana, a neuroscientist at Louisiana State University, has championed the idea of a bacterial cause. This avenue warrants further study, but, at the time of writing, there is a broad scientific consensus that CWD is caused by an abnormally-folded protein called a prion. (Bastiana claims, incidentally, that Spiroplasma bacteria are present in every case of a TSE disease, while the prion is sometimes absent.) Prions seem able to resist the enzymes and chemicals that might normally breakdown infectious proteins, allowing them to collect in the brain where they can cause brain cells to die and the formation of microscopic holes in the brain tissues. There is an additional complication too, because such infectious prions can cause normal proteins to re-fold in their own image, leading to rapid increase in prion numbers.\nCWD is always fatal, and there is normally a long incubation period before the symptoms appear. Symptoms include weight loss, behavioural changes such as the deer isolating itself from its group, blank facial expressions, increased nervousness, excessive salivation, teeth grinding and repetitive patterns of movement.\nThere are no reports of CWD from the wild in Britain, but the first European case was diagnosed in a female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) from the Nordfjella population in southern Norway during March 2016. Since then, some 25,000 wild deer in Norway have been tested, 11 of which were found to be infected: seven wild reindeer from the mountains of south-central Norway, three moose (Alces alces) near the Swedish border and a single Red deer.\nCWD is currently a significant problem in the deer and elk populations of the United States. First identified in a captive mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Colorado during the late 1960s, it has been present in wild deer herds since 1981. Wide-scale surveillance programs have led to a decline in 'reactions' (animals testing positive for the disease) in many parts of America, but recent lapses in surveillance have led to an increase in some states, including Alberta.\nAccording to an article in The Guardian newspaper, prior to the introduction of CWD surveillance in the US, in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado alone as many as one-in-ten deer and one-in-twenty elk were thought to be infected. At present, culling elk and deer, along with imposing fines for people feeding them (which draws deer from miles around and increases the potential for infection) are the only ways that authorities have found to get a handle on the situation.\nInterestingly, the prions identified from the Norwegian reindeer are very similar to those found in North American deer, suggesting they may have been imported with deer products from the USA. Importation of infected elk (Cervus canadensis) from Canada during the mid-1990s resulted in outbreaks in North Korea during 2001, 2004 and 2005. The prion isolated from the moose was new, possibly a spontaneous mutation, and characterisation from the Red deer is still underway. Given the known migratory patterns of moose, authorities are concerned there is a high probability that the disease will spread to Sweden, if it hasn’t already.\nContrary to popular misconception, there is currently no evidence that CWD can be transferred to humans, although the consumption of meat from infected animals is not advised and hunters are advised to take precautions when preparing/dressing their carcasses.\nTuberculosis (frequently shortened to TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that most often attacks the lungs. The most common form of TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, although there are various species and subspecies of Mycobacterium that can cause different forms of the disease.\nBovine TB (bTB) has been documented in wild deer, the first incidence being on a deer farm in 1988, but cases are rare. In Mammals of the British Isles: Handbook, 4th Edition, Brian Staines and his co-authors note that there is only a single ‘hot spot’ of bovine TB in wild deer in southwest England, where deer densities are unusually high, and a single record from Scotland. Indeed, a survey of mammal carcasses collected by the Food and Environment Research Agency in York confirmed bovine TB in 1% of the Red deer (Cervus elaphus) specimens, although the report did conclude that Red and Fallow (Dama dama) posed the greatest threat of transmitting the disease to cattle and that the gregarious nature of these species is likely to aid the spread of the bacteria.\nThe disease causes damage small lesions (cuts) in the lungs and lymph nodes of the deer – different species get different patterns of damage, which in turn affects how the disease can be passed to other animals. A study of the patterns of these lesions in 35 Red deer shot by hunters in France led Gina Zanella at AFSSA (France’s equivalent to DEFRA) and her team of epidemiologists to conclude that Red deer were more likely to spread the disease to other animals than wild boar were. Unlike boar, deer react to bTB infection by forming abscesses, which provides some resistance to the disease (i.e. they survive longer with the disease than boar) and makes them a ‘true host’.\nWork by Andrew Paterson at DEFRA suggests that the gross lesions associated with bTB in Red deer are an advanced feature of the disease, meaning that they can be infected with the tuberculosis bacterium without showing any visible signs. Paterson also observed that the features associated with bTB infection can sometimes be confused with infection by other Mycobacterium species, such as Avian TB and Jöhné’s Disease. Bovine tuberculosis is a notifiable disease in Britain, meaning that by law even suspicion of infection must be reported to the Local Authority and Health Protection Agency. Curiously, however, there is currently no statutory surveillance of TB in farmed, park or wild deer of any species in Britain.\nIn their Handbook chapter, Staines and his co-workers go on to point out that there are a ‘handful’ of bTB cases from Ireland. Indeed, 13% of Red deer culled in Northern Ireland between 1996 and 1997 tested positive for the disease, as did nearly 3% of the 340 deer culled in an Irish national park during 1997. Bovine TB seems more prevalent in deer outside of the UK and a survey of Red deer and wild boar killed during the 2001/02 hunting season in Normandy, France revealed that both species were ‘heavily infected by M. bovis’.\nParatuberculosis (PTB), a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract, has also been recorded in deer. The disease-causing agent is the bacterium Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, which lives in the intestinal cells and lymph nodes, causing progressive thickening of the intestinal wall. PTB is an incurable wasting disease, variants of which affect humans and livestock. According to a paper published in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases during 2002 by a team of scientists at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, PTB was found in a population of about 1,000 free-ranging Fallow deer between 1997 and 1998 in Spain. Five of the eight deer studied had diarrhoea and lung lesions, and M. a. paratuberculosis was cultivated from two.\nIt should be noted that the incidence of TB in deer is very low, as are records of deer carrying anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease and Lyme disease.\n\n Principal photography began in Bragança, Portugal,  while additional scenes were shot in Norway, and Mammoth Lakes, California. With very little dialogue featured in the film, Downey later stated that he had always been drawn to films that centered more on visual storytelling rather than relying on dialogue to convey the story. In order to combat the film's low budget, the variety of creatures that appear throughout the film are only shown in glimpses or merely implied, the film's low budget also limited the amount of production crew the filmmakers could hire, which, according to Stewart, only consisted of three other people, including himself \n\n to the dam was prohibited. The organisations also had sent a petition to both the Deputy Collector's office and the Deputy Commissioner's office, who in turn, sent the petition to the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Siddaramaiah, for scrutinity. Regarding the same issue, officials of the Karnataka State Police Board also sent a letter to the Chief Minister asking him to end the shooting of the portions of the film there, citing that the bio-diversity and life in and around the dam would be affected. The elephants featured in the film were constructed through CGI, and a disclaimer was issued for this at the beginning of the film.\n\n sequence Armour of God (1986). During the Hyderabad schedule of the film, some villagers of Anajpur village in Rangareddy district in Telangana had tried to halt the shooting of Lingaa, stating that some chemicals were mixed in the nearby lake during shoots, polluting local water. But the crew members stated that they had sought the permission of the irrigation department and the village Panchayat for shooting. The crew members also dismissed allegations of chemicals in the lake. During the shooting of the climax portions near the Linganamakki Dam, environmental organisations opposed the permission granted to the production unit for shooting, suggesting a threat to the location as public \n\n Addicted to blood, a kidnapped man is lying on the ground and screaming in pain while some people are holding him by the arms and legs.

It is operated by Prairie State Generating Company, LLC. The first 800 MW generator went online in June and the second in November, 2012. The project's Lively Grove underground mine was constructed to produce 6 million tons of high sulfur coal per year. In 2019 it was the 26th largest coal mine in the country, producing 6.4 million short tons of coal. PSEC stated it will be \"among the cleanest major coal-fueled plants in the nation\" through use of pollution mitigation technology, \n\n in 2006, making Kentucky 3rd in the nation for coal production. The state supplies 10.6% of the country with coal for power plants, giving it the nation's second-largest market share. Arguably coal's biggest economic impact has been low electric rates in Kentucky, which gives the state a competitive advantage in attracting industry, including those with heavy energy demands such as aluminum smelters and automotive plants. This has also made Kentucky one of the largest consumers of energy per capita in the nation. The state's average retail price of electricity is 5.43 cents per kilowatt hour, the 3rd lowest rate in the nation. In 2004 coal-fired power plants produced approximately 92 percent of the electricity generated in Kentucky.\n\n 2015 due to environmental regulations. The company that owns Big Sandy Unit 2, American Electric Power, is converting the facility to natural gas. In 2015, 87 percent of electricity in Kentucky was generated by a coal-based power plant; 7 percent of electricity came from a natural gas-powered plant. \"More coal-fired power plants are expected to close in the next several years,\" Daily Energy Insider wrote. The federal government proposed a new rule for regulating coal mining that would attempt to reconcile environmental protection with the reality that the U.S. needs coal for energy. The rule is controlled by a federal agency called the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation \n\n carbon capture is the capture of carbon dioxide from flue gases at power stations (in the case of coal, this coal pollution mitigation is sometimes known as \"clean coal\"). A typical new 1000 MW coal-fired power station produces around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Adding carbon capture to existing plants can add significantly to the costs of energy production; scrubbing costs aside, a 1000 MW coal plant will require the storage of about 50 Moilbbl of carbon dioxide a year. However, scrubbing is relatively affordable when added to new plants based on coal gasification technology, where it is estimated to raise energy costs for households in the United States using only coal-fired electricity sources from 10 cents per kW·h to 12 cents.\n\n Only about 40% of coal is produced directly by the company, and 60% comes from subsidiaries. Three-fourths of the company's 60 mines are underground operations. In 2008 the biggest source of coal production, the Powder River Basin (53% = 49.2mt), was home to only 32% of coal reserves (behind U.S. Northern Appalachia (35% = 800mt) and Central Appalachia (32%, thermal coal). After the merger with Massey, the company controlled 150 coal mines and 40 preparation plants, which was up significantly from the 65 mines under its control at the end of 2007. For 2011, Massey expected to ship 10 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal, about the same as Alpha (in 2010 this was 11.88 million tons or 14% of total production). In its last annual report (2009) Massey Energy reported coal sales of 38 million tons (ranking sixth in the US), compared to 84.8 million tons sold by Alpha Natural Resources in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010 Massey Energy had a coal shipment shortfall of 1.4 million tons, half of which was due to rail problems, and the other half a result of misproduction.\n\nQuestion: how much energy does coal produce in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was written by Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles along with Billy Steinberg, and Tom Kelly and recorded for the band's second studio album, Feels So Good (2002). Production on \"Love Doesn't Have to Hurt\" was helmed by Bill Padley and Jem Godfrey, with Martin Harrington and Ash Howes credited as additional producers. Initially recorded by Hoffs, it was later given to Atomic Kitten whose rendition of the Bangles' 1988 song \"Eternal Flame\" had been a number-one success the year before. The acoustic-framed mid-tempo ballad was released as the fourth and final single from Feels So Good on 31 March 2003. It peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the album's fourth consecutive top five hit in the United Kingdom, and reached number 13 on the Irish Singles Chart, also reaching the top twenty on a composite Eurochart Hot 100.

Hoffs later said: \"It wasn't a great movie but the whole experience of it was great.\" In 1988, the Bangles released their third album, Everything. The first single, co-written by Hoffs, \"In Your Room\" became a top 10 hit. Everything also produced their biggest-selling single \"Eternal Flame,\" which was also co-written and sung by Hoffs. \n\nQuestion: who played susanna in legends of the fall\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Specifically, the program is responsible for the issuance, servicing and redemption of U.S. Savings Bonds and marketable Treasury securities. Additionally, the TreasuryDirect and Legacy Treasury Direct holding systems fall under the Retail Securities Services program. Legacy Treasury Direct and TreasuryDirect systems allow individuals and institutions set up accounts to purchase Treasury securities and hold them directly with Treasury, rather than with a financial institution. The program currently is focused on supporting Treasury's goal of effectively managing government finances by positioning Treasury to eliminate new issues of paper savings bonds and improving service quality and efficiency for customers.\n\n The Wholesale Securities Services program ensures the government's critical financing needs are met and administers Treasury's auction rules and government securities market regulations. Wholesale Securities Services is responsible for the sale and issuance of trillions of dollars in securities each year, and the operation of Treasury and Federal Reserve systems that support the issuance and redemption of Treasury securities. Another responsibility of the program is identifying which securities can be pledged to the government for collateral and determining how these securities are valued. This process ensures that both government funds on deposit at commercial banks and private-sector contracts with the government are secured. The Wholesale Securities Services program contributes to Treasury's priority of financing the debt at the lowest cost over time by guaranteeing operational readiness to meet the government's financing needs and protecting and strengthening Treasury's borrowing capabilities. It also educates and builds relationships with large investors and preserves confidence in Treasury auctions through the auction rule compliance program.\n\n \"On November 25, 2008, the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $600 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. However, these purchases were to have no impact on the balance sheet, and would have been sterilized by Treasury sales by the SOMA desk. On December 1, Chairman Bernanke provided further details in a speech. On December 16 the program was formally approved by the FOMC, however their approval was not required as the SOMA desk was already authorized to acquire Agency debt and MBS as part of their OMOs. On March 18, 2009, the FOMC announced that the program would be expanded by an additional $750 billion in purchases of agency MBS and agency debt and $300 billion in purchases of Treasury securities. These purchases would be unsterilized and this date more appropriately marks the beginning of QE in the US.\n\n As part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 the U.S. Treasury was given funds to stabilize U.S. financial institutions and encourage lending. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was to be implemented in two $350 billion authorizations. The first $350 billion went primarily to the Capital Purchase Program primarily allocated under the direction of U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson an appointee of George W. Bush. The new Barack Obama appointee, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, announced the Capital Assistance Program on February 10, 2009.\n\n TSLF was announced on 11 March 2008. By the end of the program it loaned out U.S. Treasury securities worth $2.3 trillion to just eighteen Wall Street banks. In 2008, as liquidity in the global markets came to a halt, the FED took action to allow the TSLF to expand the types of acceptable collateral: student loans, car loans, home equity loans and credit card debt, as long as it was highly rated. Ironically, many of the establishment rating firms were themselves shown to be of little worth in the preceding few years, and the ratings system was in the state of being reworked. The collateral for the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) also has been expanded; eligible collateral will now include all investment-grade debt securities. Previously, only Treasury securities, agency securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities could be pledged. This was one of many emergency lending programs of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The TSLF was intended to last until February 2010, but the Fed was willing to expand its duration if market conditions warranted it. They did not, and the TSLF was closed on February 1, 2010.\n\nQuestion: what new deal program limited production in industry\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Brothers George and John Gatins had written a script that was being shipped to studios by April of that year. Taylor Kitsch was offered the lead role in July 2012, though the role eventually went to Aaron Paul that October. Paul had originally auditioned for the role of Dino Brewster, although director Scott Waugh and DreamWorks head Steven Spielberg decided against that and cast him as the lead. The same month, Imogen Poots was cast as the female lead. In January 2013, Dominic Cooper, Scott Mescudi, Ramón Rodríguez, Rami Malek and Harrison Gilbertson were cast in the film.

Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia \n\n To be elected by the electoral college, the Constitution requires that a candidate receive \"a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed.\" One early virtue of this wording was that if certain states decided not to participate in the election by failing to appoint any electors, a president could still be elected by a majority of those who were appointed. However, when Congress rejects a state's electoral vote, or chooses not to count any of multiple competing returns, \"the effect that decision has on the denominator that determines whether a candidate has more than fifty percent of the electoral vote is an entirely open issue.\". For example, if there are currently 538 total votes, and all votes from a state that appointed 20 electors are rejected, a \n\n Some elections feature an indirect electoral system, whereby there is either no popular vote, or the popular vote is only one stage of the election; in these systems the final vote is usually taken by an electoral college. In several countries, such as Mauritius or Trinidad and Tobago, the post of President is elected by the legislature. In others like India, the vote is taken by an electoral college consisting of the national legislature and state legislatures. In the United States, the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the electoral college that in turn elects the President. This can result in a situation where a candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not win the electoral college vote, as most recently happened in 2000 and 2016.\n\n the U.S. Constitution, the president was chosen by the Electoral College, which consisted of electors selected by each state. Prior to the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes; the individual who received the most electoral votes would become president, while the individual who received the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. If no individual received votes from a majority of the electors, or if two individuals tied for the most votes, then the House of Representatives would select the president in a contingent election. Under the Constitution, each state determines its own method of choosing presidential electors; in the 1788–1789 \n\n The president and vice president of the United States are formally elected by the Electoral College. The Constitution gives each state the power to appoint its electors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,\" with all states currently using some form of popular election. The electors are \"appointed\" at the national election held on Election Day, which occurs \"on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.\" After Election Day, the electors chosen in each state must then \"meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December,\" with meetings of electors typically held in each state capital.

One of these reforms was the conversion of the Central Electoral Council into the Supreme Electoral Court, and the addition of the two non-partisan members onto the makeup of the Court. The first challenge the new Court faced was the 1994 Salvadoran general election. Whilst the International Foundation for Electoral Systems' observers found that \"the El Salvador voting process was conducted in an orderly, peaceful and transparent fashion which permitted the popular will of the Salvadoran people to be expressed\", concerns were \n\n The 1950 constitution of El Salvador established a Central Electoral Council (Consejo Central de Elecciones, CCE) as the \"highest authority of electoral matters\". It was formed of three members and three deputies, all chosen by the Legislative Assembly for a period of three years from lists proposed by the Supreme Court and the executive branch. The 1962 constitution maintained the same structure. However, this structure was criticised as leading to electoral processes falling under the control of the executive branch, and led to accusations of political bias. The constitution of 15 December 1983 changed the way that the Central Electoral Council was appointed; it stated that the three members of the Council would be chosen by the Legislative Assembly, with one each being chosen from slates proposed by the three political parties or coalitions with the largest vote share in the last presidential elections. This is the same set of procedures taken for the three political members of the Court today.\n\n The government of El Salvador is a presidential representative democratic republic. El Salvador elects its head of state &ndash; the President of El Salvador &ndash; directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority. If an absolute majority (50% + 1) is not achieved by any candidate in the first round of a presidential election, then a run-off election is conducted 30 days later between the two candidates who obtained the most votes in the first round. The presidential period is five years. Consecutive re-election is not permitted, though previously elected presidents may run for a second, non-consecutive term. Salvadorans also elect a single-chamber, unicameral national legislature &ndash; the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador &ndash; composed of 84 members (deputies). They are elected by open-list proportional representation for three-year terms, with the possibility of immediate re-election.

Heisman Trophy winner Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady, playing in his final game for the Buckeyes, rushed for 146 yards on 28 carries. The Buckeyes out-gained the Wolverines by 333 rushing yards to 95. Neither team tallied significant yardage in the air: Michigan completed three of nine passes for 14 yards and gave up two interceptions; Ohio State completed one of three passes for four yards. A Michigan victory would have given the Wolverines a conference championship and sent the team to the 1956 Rose Bowl. Instead, Ohio State won the conference championship, and Michigan State received the conference's Rose Bowl invitation. It was the Buckeyes' first victory at Michigan Stadium since 1937. The Michigan Daily called it \"one of the darkest days in Michigan football history.\" At the end of the game, \"18,000 fanatical Buckeye rooters . . . swept to the field in a thunderous display of hysteria.\"\n\n On November 20, 1937, Michigan concluded its season with its annual rivalry game against an Ohio State team ranked No. 13 in the AP Poll. The game was played in the snow before a crowd of approximately 60,000 at Michigan Stadium. Ohio State dominated the game and won by a 21–0 score. Ohio State touchdowns were scored by Miller (two) and Nardi (one); the Buckeyes also scored two points on a safety in the second quarter.

However, the vintage packaging was such a success that by September 2014, the company decided to switch back to the vintage packaging full-time, including on bottles and tap handles, mirroring the unexpected success that PepsiCo had in 2009 with its Pepsi Throwback & Mountain Dew Throwback lines in tapping into the retro-themed packaging market. The unexpected sales increase, combined with wanting to differentiate the packaging from Bud Light, were factors in the decision, with some consumers even stating that Miller actually improved on the taste when nothing changed in the beer itself.\n\n In 2010, approximately 20 states authorized and or licensed the use of pull tabs. The largest volume state in terms of dollar value sold is Minnesota. In some states, no pull-tab game may offer a single prize higher than a certain amount and/or may not cost more than a certain amount. For instance, in Indiana, pull tabs cannot cost more than $1 per play, and no single prize can be more than $599. In Minnesota as well as some other states, pull tabs are offered nightly from vending booths often called jar bars. All of the tickets in a game (called a \"deal\") are poured into a transparent container that has attached to it a \"flare\" or poster that displays all of the winning symbol combinations, the quantity of winning tickets at each reward level, the name of the game, etc. Also attached to the container is a tally sheet that shows a potential player exactly how many of the \"major winners\" (major winner is one equal to or above 50x the value of the price paid for the chance) remain in that particular game at a given time.\n\n ALKA, the predecessor of the modern ring-pull caps, was introduced during the 1930s. ALKA had a seal made of natural cork. It became popular in Nordic countries and Mediterranean countries as an easy-to-open cap. ALKA was made of aluminium and had a tab or twin tabs that were pulled to remove the cap. There was no scoring on an ALKA cap. Production of the ALKA cap took place on the bottling line. In 1974 AB Wicanders Korkfabriker of Sweden patented the MaxiCap. The MaxiCap was produced from 1979 at Wicanders’ factory in Hämeenlinna Finland, now known has Finn-Korkki Oy. A MaxiCap is an aluminium closure with scoring and a tab to pull. They were easier to use than the ALKA and pre-manufactured outside of the bottling plant. This allowed for increased production speeds on the bottling line. Soon after the MaxiCap came the RingCrown closure. Invented in the early 1980s it was originally called MaxiCrown and later became known as RingCrown. The RingCrown is easier to use than its predecessors because it has an attached ring rather than a static pull off tab.\n\nAspiration of Aluminum Beverage Can Tab: Case Report and Literature Review.\nWe describe the case of a 16-year-old male who aspirated a beverage can tab resulting in significant functional impairment. Since the introduction of beverage can opening tabs (\"pop-tops\" or \"pull-tabs\") nearly 50 years ago, five cases of their aspiration have been reported in the literature and this is the first case to report tracheal lodgment. We describe the clinical course for this patient including the inadequacy of radiographic evaluation and a significant delay in diagnosis. We highlight unique features of small aluminum foreign bodies that require consideration and mention a potential change in epidemiology associated with evolving product design. Our primary objective is increased awareness among otolaryngologists that radiography is unreliable for diagnosis or localization of small aluminum foreign bodies. The patient history must therefore be incorporated with other imaging modalities and/or endoscopic evaluation. Also, given the marked prevalence of aluminum beverage cans, we suspect that the inadvertent aspiration of can tabs is more common than indicated by the paucity of published reports.\n\nQuestion: when did they stop making pull tabs on beer cans\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It uses three fleshy digitations, attached to the second sacral vertebra, the third sacral vertebra, and the fourth sacral vertebra. It also arises from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule and the sacrotuberous ligament). A few fibers also arise from the margin of the greater sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the sacrotuberous ligament. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It then inserts onto the greater trochanter of the femur. Its tendon often joins with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion. The piriformis is a flat muscle, pyramidal in shape. It lies almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip-joint.\n\nSI joint dysfunction refers to an abnormal function (e.g. hypo or hypermobility) at the joint, which places stresses on structures in or around it. Therefore sacroiliac joint dysfunction may contribute to lumbar, buttock, hamstring or groin pain.\nSacroiliac Joint Dysfunction also known as- SIJ, sacroiliac joint pain, si joint inflammation, Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, Sacroiliitis, Sacroiliacitis, Sacroiliac Joint Sprain, etc.\nThe sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. They are part synovial joint and part syndesmosis, with the synovial portion being the anterior and inferior one-third of the joint. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum.\nSI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It has been reported to occur in elite cross-country skiers, rowers, and gymnasts. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. Johnson et al. demonstrated sacral stress fractures in five collegiate athletes presenting with pain over the region of the sacroiliac joint . It is therefore prudent to perform further diagnostic workup in those subjects diagnosed with SI Joint Dysfunction who have a history of or risk factors for stress fracture or remain refractory to conservative care.\nThe sacroiliac joint can be a significant source of low back pain. Etiologies of sacroiliac pain include spondyloarthropathy, crystal arthropathy, septic arthritis, trauma, pregnancy diathesis, and mechanical SI Joint Dysfunction. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction (pain from a biomechanical disorder without a demonstrable lesion) has been proposed as a possible etiology of sacroiliac pain.\nSIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Its joint surfaces are reciprocally shaped but not congruent, have a high friction coefficient and have two large elevation allowing interdigitation with the reciprocal surface. Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. The capsule becomes more thickened and fibrous with age.\nThe SIJ motion is best described as a combination of flexion and extension, superior and inferior glide, and anterior and posterior translation. SIJ motion is minimal, with approximately 2.5 degree of rotation and 0.7 mm translation, and it is best regarded as a stress relieving joint in conjuction with its counterpart and pubic symphysis.\nIn the normal gait cycle, there are combined activities that occur conversely in the right and left innominate bones, and function in connection with the sacrum and spine. Throughout this cycle there is also rotatory motion at the pubic symphysis, which is essential to all normal motion through the joint. In static stance, when one bends forwards and the lumbar spine regionally extends, the sacrum regionally flexes, with the base moving forward and apex moving posterior. During this motion, both innominates go into motion of external rotation and out flaring. This combination of motion during forward flexion is referred to as Nutation of pelvis. The opposite occurs in extension and is called Counternutation.\nVleeming and Colleagues have described their integrated model of joint dysfunction. It integrates structure (form and anatomy), function (force and motor control) and the mind (emotions and awareness). Integral to the biomechanics of SI joint stability is the concept of a self locking mechanism. The ability of the SI joint to self lock occurs through two types of closure: form and force.\nForm closure describes how specifically shaped, closely fitting contacts provide inherent stability independent of external load. Force closure describes how external compression forces add additional stability. The fascia and muscles within the region provide significant self bracing and self locking to the SI joint and its ligaments through their cross like anatomical configuration.\nThis self bracing is formed ventrally by the external abdominal obliques, linea alba, internal abdominal obliques and transverse abdominals; dorsally the latissimus dorsi, thoracolumbar fascia, gluteus maximus and iliotibial tract contribute significantly. Vleeming et al. further proposed that the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia acted to transfer load from the ipsilateral latissimus dorsi to the contralateral gluteus maximus. This load transfer is thought to be critical during rotation of the trunk, helping to stabilize the lower lumbar spine and pelvis. A connection has also been shown between the biceps femoris muscle and the sacrotuberous ligament allowing the hamstring to play an integral role in the intrinsic stability of the SI joint. The biceps femoris, which is frequently found to be shortened on the side of the SI joint dysfunction, may act to compensate to help stabilize the joint.\nPrecipitating factors for the development of SI joint disorders may include muscle imbalance between the hip flexors and extensors or between the external and internal rotators of the hip, leg length imbalance and biomechanical abnormalities, such as excessive subtalar pronation.\nThe patient with si joint inflammation classically describes low back pain below L5. The pain is usually restricted to one side but may occasionally be bilateral. The SI joint disorders commonly refer to the buttock, groin and posterolateral thigh. Occasionally, si joint pain refers to the scrotum or labia.\nBroadhurst describes a clinically useful description of pelvic/ SI joint dysfunction. Clinically the patient has deep seated buttock pain, difficulty in negotiating stairs and problems rolling over in bed, with a triad of signs- pain over the SI joint, tenderness over the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, and pain reproduction over the pubic symphysis.\nThe physical examination should begin with observation of the athlete both statically and dynamically. The patient should be evaluated in standing, supine and prone positions, and symmetry assessed in the heights of the iliac spines, anterior superior iliac spines, posterior superior iliac spines, ischial tuberosities, glutal folds and greater trochanters as well as symmetry of the sacral sulci, inferior lateral angles and pubic tubercles.\nLeg length discrepancy should be assessed. True leg length discrepancies will generally cause asymmetry and pain, whereas a functional leg length discrepancy is usually the result of SI joint and/or pelvic dysfunction. Dynamic observation may reveal a decrease in stride length with walking, leading to a limp, or a trendelenburg gait due to reflex inhibition of the gluteus medius.\nMuscle strength and flexibility should be assessed. Full assessment of the hips and lumbar spine should also be performed. The presence of trigger points in surrounding muscles, particularly gluteus medius, should be noted. Palpation over the SI joint may reveal local tenderness.\nNumerous clinical Provocative Tests have been described to assess SI joint function. Some of the more popular tests include ,standing and sited flexion test, the stork test and Patrick (Faber) test.\nThere is no specific gold standard imaging test to diagnose SI joint dysfunction due to the location of the joint and overlying structures that make visualization difficult. By using fluoroscopically guided sacroiliac joint blocks to confirm cases of sacroiliac joint pain, several authors have shown that clinical medical history and pain provocation tests are not reliable in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain .\nPhysiotherapy for sacroiliac joint dysfunction- Patients often work with a physical therapist. After evaluating patient's condition, a therapist can assign positions and exercises to ease your symptoms. The therapist may design an exercise program to improve the strength and control of back and abdominal muscles. Some therapists are trained in manipulative techniques that attempt to treat the pain in this manner.\nSacroiliac Joint Exercises- Due to the complex nature of the SI joint and its surrounding structures, treatment must focus on the entire abdomino-lumbo-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing articular, muscular, neural and fascial restrictions, inhibitions and deficiencies.\nCore stability training should be included. A recent study has suggested that the clinical benefits incurred with training the transverse abdominis muscle may be due to significantly reduced laxity in the SI joint. Exercise rehabilitation is an integral part of recovery from SI joint dysfunction Pelvic or SI joint dysfunction should be considered with the lumbar spine in any program designed to improve the overall control of the lumbo pelvic area.\nStretching and soft tissue therapy are useful in correcting pelvic/ SI joint imbalance. The most common soft tissue abnormality found with unilateral anterior tilt are tight psoas and rectus femoris muscles.\nA technique to reduce psoas tightness is by soft tissue therapy- sustained longitudinal pressure is applied to the psoas muscle fibres superior to the inguinal ligament with the hip initially flexed and slowly moved into increased extension.\nMuscle energy technique may also be helpful, as may osteopathic manipulation. Manipulation of a dysfunctional sacro-iliac joint where the innominate bone is posteriorized using the Chicago technique, so called as it was developed by the Chicago School of Osteopathy USA.\nSacroiliac belts Some patients benefit from wearing a special brace called a sacroiliac belt. This belt wraps around the hips to hold the sacroiliac joint tightly together, which may ease your pain. Taping is another method, the Tape provides support to the SI joint and alleviates pressure on the nerves in this region. Pain relief is felt immediately and continues to improve with use.\nIf these manual techniques fail to control the sacroiliac pain, injection therapy may prove useful. A combination of local anesthetic and corticosteroid agents may be injected into the region of the SI joint, either with or without fluoroscopic guidance. Sclerosants, are occasionally used when hypermobility is present, sometimes referred to as prolotherapy.\n\n The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. In some ways, calling it a \"joint\" (singular) is a misnomer, since the lumbosacral junction includes a disc between the lower lumbar vertebral body and the uppermost sacral vertebral body, as well as two lumbosacral facet joints (right and left zygapophysial joints).\n\nThe pelvic ring is composed of two innominate bones and the sacrum.\nThe innervation to the sacroiliac joints is highly variable and complex. Pain may be referred in a sclerotomal fashion. Adjacent structures may be affected by intrinsic joint pathology and become active nociceptors. Pain referral patterns may be dependent on the distinct locations of injury to the sacroiliac joint. The anterior portion of the sacroiliac joint receives innervation from the posterior rami of the L2-S2 roots, but these contributions are highly variable and may differ in the joints of a given individual.\nAdditional innervation to the anterior joint may arise directly from the obturator nerve, the superior gluteal nerve, and the lumbosacral trunk. The posterior portion of the joint is innervated by the posterior rami of L4-S3.\nAn additional autonomic component of the innervation to the sacroiliac joint further increases the complexity of its neural supply and likely adds to the variability of the pain referral patterns.\nThe sciatic nerve passes immediately beneath or traverses through the piriformis and may become irritated by spasm of the piriformis.\nThe unique shape of the joint is essential to normal function.\nLoading is anterior and takes place on a sacral axis at the most posterior part of the S3 sacral segment of the sacroiliac joint. Note the shape at S1 and how it is prone to 'fall away' from the ilial joint surface with ligamentous loading.\nThe ilial ridge just cephalad to the S3 sacral segment prevents any cephalic movement at S3 and forces the location of the axis to the posterior aspect of S3. A bony transition point at that location has been verified by Gracovetsky.\nPrimary sacral loading is on the posterior interosseous ligaments. Secondary loading is on the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. The secondary loading will equal, but cannot exceed the primary loading. Sacral loading increases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle.\nThe ilial ridge forces the sacral axis by not allowing any cephalic movement of the sacrum on the innominate bone or any normal or pathological caudad movement of the innominate bone on the sacrum. Posterior rotation of the innominate on the sacrum can only occur with correction when the joint is already in dysfunction.\nVleeming described form closure, force closure and self-bracing in the sacroiliac joint, but this can only occur in the unloaded pelvis or in the pelvis of the fresh cadaver. WHEN THE JOINT IS LOADED EVERYTHING CHANGES. NEITHER FORM NOR FORCE CLOSURE NOR SELF-BRACING CAN OCCUR WHEN THE JOINT IS LOADED WITH THE SUPERINCUMBENT WEIGHT.\nAfter loading, the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, but posterior to the acetabula causing a posterior pelvic rotation and creating a dynamic, balanced tension on the pelvic ligaments. The posterior pelvic rotation decreases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle.\nThe sacroiliac joints are vulnerable to injury through minor and major trauma with an anterior shift in the line of gravity causing an anterior rotation of the innominate bones on the sacrum with a reversible subluxation and fixation.\nThe opposing forces created when the ligaments are loaded create a force couple. The moment created by the force couple creates a force-dependent transverse axis of rotation for the sacroiliac joints.\nThe weight of the superincumbent trunk anterior to the oblique sacral axis at S3 on the left causes a sacral movement anteriorly at S1 on the left and posteriorly at S3 on the right just as soon as the normal axis on the symmetric pelvis begins to move into asymmetry. The sacrotuberous ligament is helical and allows this movement.\nThe longer the stride, the greater is the asymmetry, the greater is the lateral sacral flexion and thus the greater the sacral rotation on the oblique axis. An oblique force couple is created from the posterior interosseous ligament on the left to the sacrotuberous ligament on the right. The sacral rotation drives trunk rotation toward the right (the side of loading), precedes the loading and serves to decrease the impact loading.\nThe piriformis muscle functions to support and assist the sacrospinous ligament in restoring the sacrum to its resting position as the pelvis moves to a position of symmetry at mid-step.\nThe sacral origin of the gluteus maximus serves to assist and support the function of the sacrotuberous ligament in bringing the distal sacrum anteriorly and laterally as the sacrum moves from lateral flexion to its resting position when the pelvis moves to symmetry at mid-step. This is necessary because the superincumbent weight is all anterior to the sacral axis and the sacrotuberous ligament is on stretch. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus and the piriformis must act as prime movers on the sacroiliac joint when the pelvis is asymmetrical.\nThe sacral origin of the gluteus maximus also functions to pull the pelvis anteriorly over the loaded side until the leg is perpendicular at mid-step. The ilial origin of the gluteus maximus then undergoes an eccentric contraction to decrease the loading forces on the contralateral side.\nThe biomechanical concepts I have described are consistent with current biotensegrity concepts.\nDysfunction of the sacroiliac joint will cause at least some dysfunction in all of these pelvic axes.\nOther than when loading and moving from recumbent to standing, normal sacral movement occurs during normal gait. When the pelvis moves obliquely to the line of travel in order to extend the length of the stride it moves from a position of symmetry into asymmetry. This position with one leg in the extreme forward position and the other in the extreme back position is called the extreme long straddle position. In this position the pelvic bone (innominate bone) on the side of the forward leg (the loading leg) rotates somewhat backward and downward on the sacrum while the pelvic bone on the side of the trailing leg rotates somewhat forward and upward. This movement on the sacrum causes the sacrum to flex laterally toward the side of loading. A force-dependent oblique axis of rotation is created. As the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, the sacrum then moves on that oblique axis to drive counter rotation of the trunk on the loading side in order to decrease the loading forces and protect the head of the femur. This is a controlled instability and it can only occur with movement in the sacroiliac joint.\nMany practitioners believe that the sacroiliac joint does not move more than just a few degrees. Even though Smidt measured up to 30 degrees of motion with the patient in the long straddle position, as if taking a long step (1, 2). Sturesson measured a subject in the long straddle position and found movement in the sacroiliac joint of only about 5 degrees (3, 4). Most physicians accept Sturesson's measurements, which were extremely accurate. In examining the method used by Sturesson I found that he had made an inadvertent error in his positioning that was responsible for a substantial error in the amount of movement measured. Most practitioners accept Sturesson's measurements as accurate, leading to the myth that the sacroiliac joint essentially has no movement and no important function.\nI have demonstrated this movement on x-ray and put it on this website rather than publish the information. Although publishing provides some stature it limits access to those professionals who may subscribe to any specific journal.\nX-rays taken of a pelvis in the long straddle position with counter rotation and with loading to the right and to the left.\nIn order to view innominate movement on the oblique asymmetric pelvis it was necessary to have the front of the pelvis square to the camera, but oblique to the line of travel.\nMovement of the posterior superior iliac spines on the sacrum is obvious and much greater than reported. Clearly, there is ample movement at the sacroiliac joint and not minimal as is commonly believed. This position is clearly static. Dynamic movement would surely demonstrate greater movement than presently observed.\nSturesson had the subject with the direction of travel straight into the camera and with the pelvis perpendicular.\nSturesson did not have the pelvis in an oblique or asymmetrical position nor did he include counter rotation. Although his measurements were extremely accurate in this position he inadvertently measured some slight movement on the symmetrical pelvis rather than normal movement on the oblique pelvis with counter rotation.\nX-rays were taken of the subject in the long straddle position with loading on the right. The x-ray on the left is with the pelvis as per Sturesson, with travel toward the front, no asymmetry and no counter rotation. The one on the right is with the pelvis facing the x-ray, with the direction of travel oblique to the x-ray, the pelvis is asymmetrical and with counter rotation to the right.\nConclusion: The sacroiliac joint demonstrates ample movement during normal ambulation when the pelvis is oblique to the line of travel and with counter rotation to the right and left.\nThanks go to Eric Wilting and John Rosenbaum of the radiology department of Northern Montana Hospital for their expert assistance in this study.\n2.

Director David Leitch wanted to create an original song for Deadpool 2 that could support the emotional core of the film, with \"Ashes\" being the song that was ultimately written.

As part of this, Leitch wanted to create an original song for the film that thematically represented these personal stakes and served as an emotional through-line for many of the characters in the film in the vein of \"Take My Breath Away\" and \"My Heart Will Go On\"; it plays over the film's James Bond-style opening credits.\n\n Leitch and music supervisor John Houlihan began meeting with songwriters to discuss the song, with Leitch focusing on conveying his thematic ideas. They \"ended up discovering\" this song \"Ashes\" as written by Petey Martin, Jordan Smith, and Tedd T. Leitch felt it \"just sort of fit and ticked all the boxes of what I was trying to do, story-wise\". Leitch then discussed with actor/producer Ryan Reynolds his wish to find a \"contemporary artist who's got the chops to make it super emotional\" for recording the song. Reynolds suggested Celine Dion as someone who is both an \"incredible singer\" and could fit into the subversive Deadpool universe. Reynolds approached Dion about this, and Leitch said that she agreed to join the project not only because her son is a fan of Deadpool but also because she was \"taken aback by the song\" and understood what they wanted to do with it.

Drafted in the second round, 61st overall, of the 2015 NFL draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Marpet is the highest-drafted pick in the history of NCAA Division III football.\n\n At the NFL Scouting Combine in February 2015, Marpet's performances identified him as one of the 2015 NFL Draft's most athletic offensive linemen. Among offensive linemen, he ran the fastest 40-yard dash, with 4.98, and the fastest 10 yd split, at 1.71 seconds.

Holliday had self-reported running times as fast as 4.21, which seemed plausible given his extensive track background, and the fastest 100 m dash time of any football player in NCAA history. At the combine, reports of Holliday's 40-yard dash time ranged from between 4.18 seconds and 4.34 seconds. Adam Schefter, an ESPN reporter on hand at the event, had reported on Twitter that NFL scouts had clocked Holliday in as low as 4.21 during the workout. However, the NFL Network broadcast team record Holliday's two tries at unofficial times of 4.27 and 4.32, respectively, and ultimately published it as 4.34 seconds officially.\n\n At the 2015 NFL Scouting Combine, Nelson had the fastest 40-yard dash with a time of 4.28 seconds, .04 seconds shy of the then-combine record of 4.24 seconds held then by Chris Johnson. Nelson was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the fifth round, 159th overall, of the 2015 NFL Draft. In a 2015 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Nelson scored his first career touchdown with a pass from quarterback Carson Palmer. He finished his rookie year with 11 receptions for 299 yards and two touchdowns. In 2016, Nelson played in 15 games with six starts, recording 34 catches for 568 yards and six touchdowns. He also had four rushing attempts for 83 yards and a touchdown including a run for 56 yards for the touchdown in Week 14. In Week 2 of the 2017 season, Nelson recorded five receptions for 120 yards, including a 45-yard touchdown catch in Arizona's 16–13 overtime win over the Indianapolis Colts. Nelson finished as the Week 2 yardage leader among all eligible receivers and won NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In 2018, Nelson had a career-low seven receptions for 64 yards and no touchdowns on the season.\n\n At the 2005 NFL Scouting Combine, Routt ran the fastest 40-yard dash at a time of 4.27 seconds, the fastest time since the NFL used electronic timing.

Substances like dried clay, although dry bulk solids composed of very fine particles, are not powders unless they are crushed because they have too much cohesion between the grains, and therefore they do not flow freely like a powder. A liquid flows differently than a powder, because a liquid cannot resist any shear stress and therefore it cannot reside at a tilted angle without flowing (that is, it has zero angle of repose.) A powder on the other hand is a solid, not a liquid, because it may support shear stresses and therefore may display an angle of repose.\n\n– dip or dipping sauce is a common condiment for many types of food.

The best way to get lycopene is in tomato sauce, tomato paste, tomato juice, and even ketchup. Lycopene is most concentrated in tomato paste. Tomatoes also contain a compound called chlorogenic acid, which may help guard against cancer by blocking the effects of certain environmental toxins—for instance, nitrosamines, cancer-causing compounds in tobacco smoke and cured meat. **Prevents heart disease. ** The jellylike substance surrounding tomato seeds is high in salicylates, which have an anticlotting effect on the blood. This may be partially responsible for tomatoes' protection against heart disease. Researchers also are finding that lycopene plays a role in heart health, lowering LDL cholesterol, increasing activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reducing in DNA damage in white blood cells. 50% more lycopene is contained in a Crimson type of tomato vs. a regular tomato. ### Health Risks\n\n**Digestive distress. ** An unidentified substance in tomatoes and tomato-based products can cause acid reflux, leading to indigestion and heartburn.

One important benefit is the high content of lycopene, a red pigment that has been associated with various health benefits. While raw tomatoes contain lycopene, cooked tomatoes actually provide more lycopene per gram. Lycopene has been linked to potential benefits in combating depression, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nTo maximize the absorption of fat-soluble phytonutrients present in tomatoes, it is recommended to add a small amount of fat to your meal when consuming foods like tomatoes. This can enhance the body's absorption of these beneficial compounds.\n\nTomato juice is particularly noteworthy for its antioxidant power, containing twice the antioxidant power compared to regularly consuming tomatoes. It may also have anti-inflammatory effects, which can assist athletes in post-exercise recovery and potentially reduce symptoms of asthma.\n\nTomato juice concentrate is also a rich source of potassium, which can help decrease the risk of stroke. Additionally, tomatoes and other vegetables contribute to reducing oxidation when consumed with meals.\n\nTomato products, such as paste, can be a healthy addition to family dinners by incorporating vegetables and providing essential nutrients. Interestingly, the yellow pigment found around tomato seeds has been found to inhibit platelet activation without affecting clotting, potentially contributing to lower cardiac mortality.\n\nWhile tomatoes have not been found to suppress tumor cell growth in most cancers, the lycopene present in tomatoes may have a protective effect against prostate cancer and cervical cancer.\n\nIt is important to note that cooking acidic foods like tomato sauce in an aluminum pot is not advised, as consuming aluminum has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\nOverall, consuming tomatoes and tomato products can offer various health benefits, but it is always essential to maintain a balanced and diverse diet for optimal health.\n\n A plum tomato, also known as a processing tomato or paste tomato, is a type of tomato bred for sauce and packing purposes. It is generally oval or cylindrical in shape, with significantly fewer locules (seed compartments, usually only two) than standard round tomatoes and a generally higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing into paste. Plum tomatoes are also sometimes favored by cooks for use during the tomato off-season, as they are generally considered more amenable to handling and are therefore available in a state closer to ripe than other supermarket tomatoes.\n\nQuestion: whats the difference between tomato paste and tomato puree\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its origin is thought to lie deep in the mantle, perhaps at the boundary between the core and the mantle at approximately 2,880 km depth. Opinions differ as to whether seismic studies have imaged such a structure. In this framework, the volcanism of Iceland is attributed to this plume, according to the theory of W. Jason Morgan. It is believed that a mantle plume underlies Iceland, of which the hotspot is thought to be the surface expression, and that the presence of the plume enhances the volcanism already caused by plate separation. Additionally, flood basalts on the continental margins of Greenland and Norway, the oblique orientation of \n\n In geological terms, Iceland is a young island. It started to form in the Miocene era about 20 million years ago from a series of volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it lies between the North American and Eurasian plates. These plates spread at a rate of approximately 2.5 centimeters per year. This elevated portion of the ridge is known as the Reykjanes Ridge. The volcanic activity is attributed to a hotspot, the Iceland hotspot, which in turn lies over a mantle plume (the Iceland Plume) an anomalously hot rock in the Earth's mantle which is likely to be partly responsible for the island's creation and continued existence. \n\n center to cease 15 million years ago and lead to the formation of a new one in the area of today's peninsulas Skagi and Snæfellsnes; in the latter there is still some activity in the form of the Snæfellsjökull volcano. The spreading center, and hence the main activity, have shifted eastward again 7–9 million years ago and formed the current volcanic zones in the southwest (Reykjanes, Hofsjökull) and northeast (Tjörnes). Presently, a slow decrease of the activity in the northeast takes place, while the volcanic zone in the southeast (Katla, Vatnajökull), which was initiated 3 million years ago, develops. The reorganisation of the plate boundaries in Iceland has also been attributed to microplate tectonics. \n\n have generated devastating glacial bursts, most recently in 2010 after the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull. Iceland's location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and North American Plates are moving apart, is partly responsible for this intense volcanic activity, but an additional cause is necessary to explain why Iceland is a substantial island while the rest of the ridge mostly consists of seamounts, with peaks below sea level. As well as being a region of higher temperature than the surrounding mantle, it is believed to have a higher concentration of water. The presence of water in magma reduces the melting temperature, which may also play a role in enhancing Icelandic volcanism.\n\n Iceland straddles the mid-Atlantic ridge where the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates move away from each other. Volcanic activity is common along such divergent boundaries but strong earthquakes are rare. In Iceland the ridge is somewhat off-set, creating two transform faults where plates move horizontally along each other. One is in the north of the country and one in the south; the strongest Icelandic earthquakes happen along those transform faults. The 29 May quake is classified by geologists as typical Suðurlandsskjálftar (literally: Southern Iceland quakes), which happen on the southern fault.\n\nQuestion: what type of plate boundary is associated with iceland and its volcanic eruptions\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These were the Express or Lilliputian, Fairfield and Enfield. Kitson and Company of Leeds built Ariel's Girdle in 1851. However, the next railcars were built in 1902 for the London & South Western Railway for the line from to, although before entering passenger service it was lent to the Great Western Railway (GWR). By 1908 the GWR had purchased or built 99 railcars (or railmotors as they called them), but from 1917 began converting them into autocoaches for use on push-pull trains with a steam locomotive, as these were more reliable and were able to haul additional carriages or goods wagons. Between 1905 and 1911 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) purchased or built seventeen steam rail cars, some running into the 1940s. After trials in 1924, the London & North Western Railway bought three types of steam railcars from Sentinel-Cammell and Claytons. a reconstructed GWR 1908 steam railmotor is operational, based at Didcot Railway Centre and an GWR autotrailer is being restored.\n\n  The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837 by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen, and it was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Davidson later built a larger locomotive named Galvani, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two direct-drive reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of 1+1/2 mi. It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September \n\n Colliery.

It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their job security. The first electric passenger train was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879. The locomotive was driven by a 2.2 kW, series-wound motor, and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13 km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a 300-meter-long (984 feet) circular track. The electricity (150 V DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks. \n\n During the age of steam locomotion, the British railway industry strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities. The earliest attempt to build a railway line dedicated for operation at the higher speeds was the Great Central Main Line, opened by the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1899. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. Although the tunnel scheme was not realised by this railway company, the route operated services between and  via, with the dedicated express track beginning at  in Nottinghamshire. The line was built to certain specifications so that it could take advantage of the higher speeds offered by \n\nQuestion: when did the first train run in england\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed the border regions of Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the Munich Agreement of 1938. Hitler was not satiated and, in March 1939, seized all of Czechoslovakia and menaced Poland. At last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.\n\n On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Britain's declaration of war automatically committed India, the Crown colonies, and the protectorates, but the 1931 Statute of Westminster had granted autonomy to the Dominions so each decided their course separately. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies immediately joined the British declaration on 3 September, believing that it applied to all subjects of the Empire and Commonwealth. New Zealand followed suit simultaneously, at 9.30 pm on 3 September (local time), after Peter Fraser consulted the Cabinet; although as Chamberlain's broadcast was drowned by static, the Cabinet (led by Fraser as Prime Minister Michael Savage was terminally \n\n The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, two days after Germany invaded Poland. France also declared war on Germany later the same day. The state of war was announced to the British public in an 11 AM radio broadcast by the prime minister Neville Chamberlain. \"This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.\"\n\n marked the beginning of World War II. On 3 September 1939, Britain and France, which were allied with Poland, declared war on Germany. Poland moved its government abroad, first to France and, after its fall in May 1940, to London. The Poles contributed greatly to the Allied war effort and the Polish Air Force pilots played a conspicuous role in the Battle of Britain and the Polish army formed in Britain later fought during Operation Overlord. The Polish Government in Exile, though denied majority international recognition after 1945, remained at its post in London until formally dissolved in 1991, after a democratically elected president had taken office in Warsaw. Currently, both countries are NATO and OECD members and allies. Since the European Union's 2004 enlargement, a significant number of Poles emigrated to the United Kingdom and now constitute one of the largest ethnic minorities in the country.\n\n World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland, as France and Britain declared war in response. Western leaders were stunned when the Soviet Union and Germany split control of Poland; the two powers had reached a non-aggression pact in August 1939, which contained a secret protocol for the partition of Poland. Though few Americans wanted to intervene in the war, an October 1939 Gallup poll showed that over 80 percent of the country favored Britain and France over Germany.

The Didactic method, also known as the lecture method, is a teaching approach where the instructor plays a central role in delivering information to students. However, it is important to note that the Didactic method can still involve active learning strategies alongside the lecture component.\n\nActive learning refers to instructional methods that require students to engage in meaningful activities, such as discussions, problem-solving, or hands-on activities, to enhance their understanding and retention of the material. While the Didactic method primarily involves the instructor presenting information, it does not necessarily exclude opportunities for active learning. In fact, certain elements of active learning can be incorporated into a Didactic teaching session to promote deeper understanding and active engagement among students.\n\nFor instance, an instructor can incorporate group discussions or question-and-answer sessions during the lecture to encourage student participation and interaction. Additionally, integrating multimedia resources, case studies, or demonstrations into the lecture can help enhance students' understanding and make the learning experience more interactive.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that while the Didactic method is mainly focused on information transmission from the instructor to the students, it does not imply that all passive learning is encouraged. Educators can employ various strategies to make the Didactic method more interactive and promote active engagement among students. By integrating active learning techniques, the Didactic method can become more effective in facilitating student learning and understanding.\n\n While Cornell students are no stranger to such activities as streaking, screaming before finals, or flash mobs, other impromptu activities are more specific to Cornell and its unique terrain: Traying down Libe Slope: After a fresh snowfall, undergraduates have been known to smuggle trays from the dining options in Willard Straight Hall or from the dormitory dining halls and use them to sled down Cornell's dramatic Libe Slope, a 100-foot hill stretching from Cornell West Campus to Uris Library, the undergraduate home of the Cornell University Library.

The three-pronged program includes his promise of college scholarships (including room, board, books and tuition) for members of the community who are accepted to vocational school, college or university in the state of Florida. The program includes a parent resource center and ten neighborhood preschools. As of 2016, more than 200 college degrees have been awarded through this program. For more than ten years, Rosen has funded an alternative spring break for about a dozen Cornell students who wish to spend their vacation in \n\nStudents with reading deficits often use various methods and tools to help them review material and improve their reading skills. Some commonly used methods and tools include tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers.\n\nTape recorders are beneficial for students with reading deficits as they allow for the recording of lectures or class discussions. This enables the students to review the material at their own pace, replaying the recordings as needed. By using tape recorders, students can focus on understanding the content without the pressure of keeping up with the reading or taking notes simultaneously.\n\nTutorial aids are another helpful resource for students with reading deficits. These aids can include visual aids, such as charts, diagrams, or illustrations, that help visualize and simplify complex information. Additionally, tutorial aids may include step-by-step guides or summaries that provide a concise overview of the material. These aids serve as valuable supplements to the reading material and facilitate comprehension for students with reading difficulties.\n\nLaptop computers are also commonly used by students with reading deficits. With access to digital textbooks, e-books, and online resources, students can utilize various assistive technologies to support their reading. For example, text-to-speech software can read the written content aloud, allowing students to follow along and listen to the text. Similarly, speech-to-text software enables students to dictate their responses or ideas, reducing the reliance on writing skills. These technological tools provide alternative ways for students to engage with and process information.\n\nIt is important to note that the Orton phonologic method has been widely used for individuals with reading deficits. This method focuses on teaching phonemic awareness and phonics skills, aiming to improve reading and decoding abilities. While the Orton phonologic method has been effective for many individuals, it's crucial to consider individualized approaches and interventions based on each student's specific needs and learning style.\n\nIn conclusion, students with reading deficits utilize various methods and tools such as tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers to review material and improve their reading skills. These resources offer alternative ways to access and understand information, catering to individual needs and enhancing learning outcomes.\n\n A recently begun Cornell tradition is the New Student Reading Project, sometimes called the Freshmen Reading Project. Begun for the Class of 2005, all incoming freshmen and transfer students were required to read a book chosen by the university. Alumni and faculty were also encouraged to read the book. When students arrived, they participated in discussion groups and other activities related to the book. For example, in the fall of 2005, Chinua Achebe came to Cornell and discussed his Things Fall Apart ('09). Other books have been Guns, Germs, and Steel ('05), Frankenstein ('06), Antigone ('07), The Trial ('08), The Great Gatsby ('10), The Pickup ('11), Lincoln at Gettysburg ('12), The Grapes of Wrath ('13), Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? ('14), Homer & Langley ('15), The Life Before Us ('16), When the Emperor was Divine ('17), Clash of Civilizations Over an Elevator in Piazza Vittorio ('18), and Slaughterhouse Five ('19). The tradition was discontinued in 2016, and no book was assigned to the Class of '20.\n\nQuestion: who invented the cornell method of note taking\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ellison's book, Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven (1995), he stated: \"In the early 1990s, when ambiguity in romantic relationships accompanies changing expectations for both men and women, this song demonstrates Dolly Parton's appeal as a songwriter in the pop music market.\" Ken Knight, author of The Midnight Show: Late Night Cable-TV \"Guy-Flicks\" of the '80s (2008), commented that Parton is the only singer who can sing \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"make it memorable\". Writer Paul Simpson criticized the singer, stating that the track was only written to \"soften the blow\" of Parton and Wagoner's split.\n\n chemist and King as a secretary. They wrote songs together in the evening. Neil Sedaka, who had dated King when he was still in high school, had a hit in 1959 with \"Oh! Carol\". Goffin took the tune and wrote the playful response, \"Oh! Neil\", which King recorded and released as a single the same year. The B-side contained the Goffin-King song \"A Very Special Boy\". The single was not a success. After writing the Shirelles' Billboard Hot 100 number 1 hit \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\", the first No.1 hit by a black girl group, Goffin and King gave up their daytime jobs to concentrate on writing. \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" became a standard.\n\n Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\" received widespread acclaim from music critics, being now regarded as her \"signature song\". Larry Flick of Billboard wrote that the song is \"bolstered by a remarkably restrained (and ultimately effective) vocal by Houston. She builds to dramatic, heartfelt conclusion that makes sense, given the unusually slow-building created by producer David Foster.\" Randy Clark of Cashbox noted that \"the unstoppable voice and unquestionable talent of Whitney Houston will no doubt come roaring back onto the charts with this cover\". Amy Linden of Entertainment Weekly said it \"is artistically satisfying and uncharacteristically hip for the MOR songbird.\" John Martinucci of Gavin Report \n\n \"I Still Can't Get Over Loving You\" is a 1983 song written and performed by Ray Parker Jr.. It was the lead single from his Woman Out of Control album of the same year, and it reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1984. It was Parker's fifth Top 20 hit, the sixth being 1984's \"Ghostbusters\". The song is an up-tempo ballad with electronic instruments. While initially the song speaks of lost love and an ended relationship, the lyrics gradually take a considerably more sinister tone, ultimately implying that the man either is stalking his former girlfriend, or potentially preparing to do harm to her. A turning point in the tone occurs when Parker borrows a line from The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\", \"Every breath you take, I'll be watching you.\" This is summarily followed by closing lines which indicate that the relationship has taken a dark turn: \"There's no way that this thing is through, no; Not yet, I ain't through lovin' you; I'm gettin' mad, girl, don't you ever try to leave, no, no; It'll be the last thing you'll ever do.\"\n\n \"I'll Still Love You\" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jim Weatherly. First recorded for and Weatherly's 1974 album The Songs of Jim Weatherly, the single release peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, No. 14 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, and No. 87 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The war is in what will be known as the \"Second Period\", which starts after the fall of Wuhan in October 1938 and ends in December 1941 with Pearl Harbor. This conflict will eventually be swept up into World War II when Japan joins the Axis and China joins the Allies. 1: The invasion of Poland by Germany starts at 4:45 a.m. when the Kriegsmarine's battleship Schleswig-Holstein opens fire on the \n\n The Second World War is a narrative history of World War II by the British historian Antony Beevor. The book starts with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and covers the entire Second World War ending with the final surrender of Axis forces.\n\n This is a timeline of events of World War II in 1939, from the start of the war on 1 September 1939. For events preceding September 1, 1939, see the timeline of events preceding World War II. Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, and Britain and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later marks the beginning of World War II. After the declaration of war, western Europe saw very little land or air active military confrontation at first, and the period was termed the \"Phoney War\". In eastern Europe, however, the agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed on 23 August opened the way in September for the Soviet Union's invasion of eastern Poland, which was divided between the two invaders before the end of the month.

World War II was the deadliest war in history which started in 1939 and ended in 1945. Following political instability built-up in Europe from 1930, Germany, which aimed to dominate Europe, attacked Poland on 1 september 1939 marking the official start of World War II. The USSR (Soviet Union) invaded Poland from 17 September 1939, when the Polish state and its government actually ceased to exist. Germany with its allies attacked the USSR on 22 June 1941, and the country lost 26.6 million people during four years of the Great Patriotic war. The war in Europe ended on 7 May 1945 with the capitulation of Germany to the allied (including Soviet) forces. About 80-90% of losses during the entire war the German armed forces suffered on the Soviet (Eastern) front, whose contribution to the victory was decisive. By the end of the war, the Soviet Union produced 30.3 million rifles; 1,476 million machine guns; 516,648 artillery guns; 347,900 mortars; 119,769 tanks and self-propelled guns; 265,600 army trucks; 213,742 military aircraft; 2 cruisers; 25 destroyers; 52 submarines.\n\nQuestion: when did world war 2 officially start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Meanwhile, a recording of the Ruth Crawford Seeger \"Don't You Hear The Lambs A-Crying\" was done for the 1989 album American Folk Songs for Christmas by Peggy Seeger, Mike Seeger, and Penny Seeger. Dartmouth's Polansky then arranged the song under that title for strings in 1999, which was premiered at that year's Spoleto Music Festival. The original strain of \"Blood-Stained Banders\" is still played; Bobby Horton recorded it in 2003 with an extended guitar part, as part of the soundtrack for the Ken Burns documentary Horatio's Drive. Hickerson also still performs the tune in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n In 1953, Ruth Crawford Seeger collected and transcribed the song as \"Don't You Hear The Lambs A-Crying\" in her acclaimed volume American Folk Songs for Christmas. Dartmouth College music professor Larry Polansky comments that in doing so, Ruth Crawford Seeger took the hard-edged gospel blues and \"revoice[d] it as a beautiful, shape-note influenced hymn.\" The \"Blood Stained Banders\" form was then recorded by The Folksmiths in 1958 on their Folkways Records LP We've Got Some Singing to Do. This was an effort organized by Joe Hickerson, who would become director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. We've Got Some Singing to Do and its accompanying songbook were distributed to a number of summer camps, and were responsible for the popularization of several freedom-longing African-American songs such as \"Kum Ba Yah\".

Its true origins are in the United States: \"This is a lovely folklore story, but sadly Mary Thomas of Llangollen was not the heroine of the nursery rhyme ... The Mary of the rhyme was Mary Sawyer and the school was the Redstone Schoolhouse in Sterling Massachusetts, U.S.A.\" \n\n Like the other Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience, The Lamb may have been intended to be sung, but no records survive of Blake's own musical settings. It was set to music by Vaughan Williams in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs, although he described it as \"that horrible little lamb – a poem that I hate\". It was also given a setting by Sir John Tavener, who explained: \"The Lamb came to me fully grown and was written in an afternoon and dedicated to my nephew Simon for his 3rd birthday.\" American poet Allen Ginsberg set the poem to music, along with several other of Blake's poems, in 1969 and was included on his album Songs of Innocence and Experience by William Blake. Ginsberg's songs were re-worked by Steven Taylor for the album Songs of Innocence & of Experience: Shewing The Two Contrary States Of The Human Soul, released in 2019, by Ace Records, to coincide with the Blake exhibition at Tate Britain.\n\n ”Queen Mary's Song” is a song written by the English composer Edward Elgar in 1889.

Advances in technology and automation such as 3D printing technologies have made bringing manufacturing back to the United States, both cost effective and possible. Adidas, for example, plans producing highly customized shoes with 3D printers in the U.S.\n\n however, did not undo the damage. New factories often: Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the 2012 US presidential campaigns, but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs. A counterswing depicted by a 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource. Deloitte's survey identified three trends:\n\n To those who are concerned that nations may be losing a net number of jobs due to outsourcing, some point out that insourcing also occurs. A 2004 study in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. The New York Times disagreed, and wrote that free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages. The impact of offshore outsourcing, according to two estimates published by The Economist showed unequal effect during the period studied 2004 to 2015, ranging from 150,000 to as high as 300,000 jobs lost per year. In 2010, a group of manufacturers started the Reshoring Initiative, focusing on bringing manufacturing jobs for American companies back to the country. Their data indicated that 140,000 American jobs were lost in 2003 due to offshoring. Eleven years later in 2014, the United States recovered 10,000 of those offshored positions; this marked the highest net gain in 20 years. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies \"offshored\" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return.\n\n A 2012 series of articles in Atlantic Magazine   highlighted a turning of the tide for parts of the USA's manufacturing industry. Specific causes identified include rising third-world wages, recognition of hidden off-shoring costs, innovations in design/manufacture/assembly/time-to-market, increasing fuel and transportation costs, falling energy costs in the US, increasing US labor productivity, and union flexibility. Hiring at GE's giant Appliance Park in Louisville increased 90% during 2012.\n\n Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North. Not all manufacturing should return to the U.S. The rise of the middle class in China, India and other countries has created markets for the products made in those countries. Just as the U.S. has a \"Made in U.S.A.\" program, other countries support products made in their countries as well. Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster. The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.\n\nQuestion: factories that assemble parts made in other countries\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Romans 1:16, by stating that the Gospel is the same for Jew and Gentile, may present a serious problem for dual-covenant theology. is sometimes cited as a verse supporting dual-covenant theology. A problem with this argument, however, is the context of Galatians 5. Galatians 5:4 in particular, says, \"You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.\" Line this up with Galatians 2, Galatians 2:21 in particular, which says \"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ \n\n needlessly.\" Scholars still debate the meaning of the Pauline phrase \"Works of the Law\" (see New Perspective on Paul and Federal Vision). A similar challenge is presented by Galatians 2:15 and 16, just after the Incident at Antioch, in which Paul says (speaking to Peter, a fellow Jew), \"We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\" The same exclusive claims for the Christian message are also made by other \n\n The Epistle to the Galatians says that, prior to his conversion, Paul was a Pharisee who \"violently persecuted\" the followers of Jesus. \"You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. I advanced in Judaism beyond many among my people of the same age, for I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.\"\n\n Sometime in AD 48–55, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to the Galatians in Greek, the medium of communication in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire. This may mean that Galatians at the time were already bilingual in Greek, as St. Jerome later reports. However, scholars are divided as to whether Paul was writing to Greek Galatians or to the Hellenized descendants of the Celtic Galatians. Lucian of Samosata recorded in circa AD 180 that the prophet Alexander of Abonoteichus was able to find Celtic-speaking interpreters for his oracles in Paphlagonia (immediately northeast of Galatia). The physician Galen of Pergamon in the late 2nd century AD complained that the commonly spoken Greek of his day was being corrupted by borrowings of foreign words from languages such as Galatian. In the 4th century St. Jerome (Hieronymus) wrote in a comment to Paul the Apostle's Epistle to the Galatians that \"apart from the Greek language, which is spoken throughout the entire East, the Galatians have their own language, almost the same as the Treveri\". The capital of the Treveri was Trier, where Jerome had settled briefly after studying in Rome.\n\n The Epistle to the Galatians, often shortened to Galatians, is the ninth book of the New Testament. It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia. Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age. Paul argues that the gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly religious male circumcision, by contextualizing the role of the law in light of \n\nQuestion: who is the book of galatians written to\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These fragments often give further insights into Aeschylus' work. He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy. His Oresteia is the only extant ancient example. At least one of his plays was influenced by the Persians' second invasion of Greece (480–479 BC). This work, The Persians, is one of very few classical Greek tragedies concerned with contemporary events, and the only one extant. The significance of the war with Persia was so great to Aeschylus and the Greeks that his epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon while making no mention of his success as a playwright.\n\n Seven against Thebes (Hepta epi Thebas) was performed in 467 BC. It has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs. Another theme, with which Aeschylus' would continually involve himself, makes its first known appearance in this play, namely that the polis was a key development of human civilization. The play tells the story of Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of the shamed king of Thebes, Oedipus. Eteocles and Polynices agree to share and alternate the throne of the city. After the first year, Eteocles refuses to step down. Polynices therefore undertakes war. The pair kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers. But a new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices, and Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict. The play was the third in a connected Oedipus trilogy. The first two plays were Laius and Oedipus. The concluding satyr play was The Sphinx.\n\n Aeschylus (, ; Aiskhylos, ; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, and is often described as the father of tragedy. Academic knowledge of the genre begins with his work, and understanding of earlier Greek tragedy is largely based on inferences made from reading his surviving plays. According to Aristotle, he expanded the number of characters in the theatre and allowed conflict among them. Formerly, characters interacted only with the chorus. Only seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived. There is a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of one of them, Prometheus Bound, with some scholars arguing that it may be the work of his son Euphorion. Fragments from other \n\n A kommos (from Greek κομμός, kommós, literally \"striking\", especially \"beating of the head and breast in mourning\" ) is a lyrical song of lamentation in an Athenian tragedy that the chorus and a dramatic character sing together. A kommos occurs \"when the tension of the play rises to a climax of grief or horror or joy\". Examples include the final section (lines 908-1077) of Aeschylus' The Persians (472 BCE) in which Xerxes laments the defeat of his Persian army, the final appearance of Antigone in Sophocles' Antigone (c.442 BCE), the interaction between the chorus and Oedipus when he returns having blinded himself in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex (c.429 BCE), and the exchange between Orestes, Electra and the chorus immediately after Clytemnestra's murder in Euripides' Electra (c.410 BCE).\n\n Agathon was the son of Tisamenus, and the lover of Pausanias, with whom he appears in both the Symposium and Plato's Protagoras. Together with Pausanias, he later moved to the court of Archelaus, king of Macedon, who was recruiting playwrights; it is here that he probably died around 401 BC. Agathon introduced certain innovations into the Greek theater: Aristotle tells us in the Poetics (1456a) that the characters and plot of his Anthos were original and not, following Athenian dramatic orthodoxy, borrowed from mythological or historical subjects. Agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays. Agathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and \n\nQuestion: who wrote antigone and what are the dates of his birth and death\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Walker then explains her passion for poetry, \"Since that time, it seems to me that all of my poems-and I write groups of poems rather than singles-are written when I have successfully pulled myself out of a completely numbing despair, and stand again in the sunlight. Writing poems is my way of celebrating with the world that I have not committed suicide the night before\".

Mearns is credited with the well-known rhyme, composed in 1899 as a song for a play he had written, called The Psyco-ed. The play was performed in 1910, and the poem was first published as \"Antigonish\" in 1922.   Mearns also wrote many parodies of this poem, entitled Later Antigonishes, such as \"Alibi\":\n\n Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone. The couplet tie at the end of the sonnet \"sums up the poem: look, mourn (moan), world\". By the couplet \"[the speaker] is gone, no longer corporeal at all.\" While the quatrains lead up to a climax in quatrain 3, the couplet suggests a point, a succinct conclusion. According to Atkins, in the couplet \"The primary notion is that the world will judge the poet's shortcoming only too well,\" as clarified by Tucker [1924]. After the speaker's urge for the beloved not to mourn him, one might expect several different orthodox explanations at the conclusion. Instead of what is expected \"we get: 'Forget me when I am dead – after all, someone might make fun of you.'\" Alternately, Pequigney believes \"the answer [as to what the couplet means] depends on our mood as we read it.\" He maintains that \"we learn more about ourselves when we interpret this poem than we do about its author.\" Overall, \"the couplet is superbly organized, both in the management of its rhythms and in its backward verbal reflection to the patterning of the whole poem.\"\n\nQuestion: when was i look at the world poem written\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The beavers also give the children information about Aslan the lion, the true king of Narnia who is on the move to stop the White Witch. The children learn they are part of a prophecy which states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned kings of Narnia, ending the tyranny of the White Witch. They all soon realise that Edmund has gone - Mr. Beaver correctly infers that he has gone to meet the White Witch, having allied himself with her on his previous visit.

In subsequent seasons, Thawne makes sporadic appearances. In season two, a flash drive containing Thawne's will as Wells bequeathes S.T.A.R. Labs to Barry and a video-recorded confession to Nora's murder which allows for Henry's exoneration. Barry later travels back in time to season one's timeframe to obtain Thawne's help with tachyon equipment. In season three, Barry saves Nora from Thawne's true form who is locked up in a prison. After the Flashpoint timeline's dangers, Barry realizes the mistake and releases Thawne to kill Nora again hoping the timeline will revert to normal. In season four, Thawne is revealed to clearly know \n\n Thawne was left stranded with his Speed Force connection severed so he killed the real Wells and assumed his identity. As Wells, he then founded S.T.A.R. Labs and orchestrated events to turn Barry into the Flash, hoping to use Barry's pure Speed Force connection to return home. After being exposed and later captured by Barry with help from Oliver Queen, Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, Thawne offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save the Allen family in exchange for a time machine to return to the 22nd century. Barry ultimately refuses and destroys Thawne's machine. The two speedsters then fight, with Thawne prevailing until \n\n Eobard Thawne found a time capsule in the 25th century containing a costume of the Flash (Barry Allen) and with a Tachyon device amplified the suit's speed energy, giving himself speedster abilities. Reversing the costume's colors, he adopted the moniker of \"Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash\" and went on a crime spree. However, the time capsule also contained an atomic clock, and to prevent a nuclear explosion, Flash pursued and defeated Zoom, hoping he knew where the clock was. Unfortunately he did not, but Flash later found the clock, detonated it safely, and destroyed Thawne's costume. Blaming the Flash for his defeat, Thawne became obsessed with \"replacing\" Barry and traveled back in time to exact his revenge. When Iris West (Barry's wife) rejected his romantic pursuits, Thawne killed Iris. After Flash had found love again, Thawne threatened to kill Fiona Webb (Barry's new fiancé) on their wedding day. Fearful that history was repeating itself, Barry killed Thawne by breaking his neck.\n\n In the 2011 Flashpoint storyline, a new timeline is created through the alteration of history. The Reverse-Flash reveals that his body is permanently connected to the Speed Force, enabling him to create a negative version, with which he escaped prison. He was unable to alter Barry's transformation into the Flash, however, as that would effectively erase himself from existence. Instead, Thawne decides to ruin Barry's life during the latter's childhood, killing his mother, Nora. Thawne later reveals that the Flashpoint timeline was created when Barry went back in time to stop the Reverse-Flash from killing Nora. After Thawne is killed by this reality's Batman with a sword stab through the chest, the Flash travels back in time to stop Barry's younger self from altering history but instead, under Pandora's manipulations, a third, new timeline is created, in which DC Comics' continuity takes place from 2011 onward.\n\n In a flashback in season one, Barry Allen's (who will later become the speedster known as the Flash) mother Nora is murdered by a yellow blur and his father Henry wrongfully convicted.

Initially, the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but later they turn against the followers of Jesus. Rejected by the Jews, the message is taken to the Gentiles under the guidance of Paul the Apostle. The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial. Luke–Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides is that the message of Christ \n\n Roman Cyprus was visited by the Apostles Paul, Barnabas and St. Mark, who came to the island at the beginning of their first missionary journey in 45 AD, according to Christian tradition, converting the people of Cyprus to Christianity and founding the Church of Cyprus, After their arrival in Salamis, they proceeded to Paphos where they converted the Roman governor Sergius Paulus to Christ. In the New Testament book of Acts of the Apostles, author St. Luke describes how a Jewish magician named Bar-Jesus (Elymas) was obstructing the Apostles in their preaching of the Gospel. Paul rebuked him, announcing that he would temporarily become blind due to God's judgment. Paul's prediction immediately came true. As a result of this, Sergius Paulus became a believer, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. In this way, Cyprus \n\n about the protection Paul received from Roman officials against Gentile rioters in Philippi (Acts 16:16–40) and Ephesus (Acts 19:23–41), and against Jewish rioters on two occasions (Acts 17:1–17; Acts 18:12–17). Meanwhile, Roman readers may have approved of Paul's censure of the illegal practice of magic (Acts 19:17–19) as well as the amicability of his rapport with Roman officials such as Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6–12) and Festus (Acts 26:30–32). Furthermore, Acts does not include any account of a struggle between Christians and the Roman government as a result of the latter's imperial cult. Thus Paul is depicted as a moderating presence between the church and the Roman Empire. On the other hand, events such as the \n\n Prior to the 1950s, Luke–Acts was seen as a historical work, written to defend Christianity before the Romans or Paul against his detractors; since then the tendency has been to see the work as primarily theological. Luke's theology is expressed primarily through his overarching plot, the way scenes, themes and characters combine to construct his specific worldview. His \"salvation history\" stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of \"the Law and the Prophets\" (Luke 16:16), the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5–3:1); second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the Kingdom of God was preached (Luke \n\n The Acts of the Apostles (, Práxeis Apostólōn; Actūs Apostolōrum) is the fifth book of the New Testament; it tells of the founding of the Christian Church and the spread of its message to the Roman Empire. Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up a two-part work, Luke–Acts, by the same anonymous author. It is usually dated to around 80–90 AD, although some scholars suggest 90–110. The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised messiah. Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century, beginning with the ascension of Jesus to Heaven.

In 1989 the PI- Calculus was created by Robin Milner and was very successful throughout the years. The PI Calculus is an extension of the extension of the process algebra CCS, a tool that has algebraic languages that are specific to processing and formulating statements. The PI Calculus provides a formal theory for modeling systems and reasoning about their behaviors. In the PI Calculus there are two specific variables such as name and processes. But it was not until 2002 when Shahram Rahimi decided to create an upgraded version of the PI- Calculus and call it the API Calculus. Milner claimed the detailed characteristics of the API Calculus to be its \"Communication Ability, Capacity for Cooperation, Capacity for \n\n He holds the current unofficial world record (100,000 digits) in 16 hours, starting at 9a.m. (16:28 GMT) on October 3, 2006. He equaled his previous record of 83,500 digits by nightfall and then continued until stopping with digit number 100,000 at 1:28 a.m. on October 4, 2006. The event was filmed in a public hall in Kisarazu, east of Tokyo, where he had five-minute breaks every two hours to eat onigiri to keep up his energy levels. Even his trips to the toilet were filmed to prove that the exercise was legitimate. His previous world record of 83,431 was performed from July 1, 2005, to July 2, 2005. On Pi Day, 2015, he claimed to be able to recite 111,701 digits. Despite Haraguchi's efforts and detailed documentation, the Guinness World Records have not yet accepted any of his records set. Haraguchi views the memorization of pi as \"the religion of the universe\", and as an expression of his lifelong quest for eternal truth.\n\n Notre Dame Math Club was established on March 14, 2017 (Pi Day). The Club regularly organizes seminars, workshops and tutorial classes for students interested in mathematics. It also helps weak students develop skills in mathematics. Apart from regular programs, the club also organises the annual inter-school/inter-college program called the Notre Dame Math Festival. During this festival various mathematical competitions are held among school and college-level students from multiple institutions. The club annually publishes a hand written scrap magazine called The Number  on Pi Day. On Pi Day 2018, the club published its first printed annual magazine called The Function.\n\n Students in the Faculty of Mathematics are represented by the Mathematics Society (MathSoc), which represents student interests to the university, operates the Math Coffee and Donut Shop, publishes the Faculty newspaper mathNEWS, and runs student services including an exam bank and lounge space. Pi Day is celebrated by the Department in each term: on 14 March (3/14), on 22 July (22/7, Pi Approximation Day), and on 10 November (the 314th day of the year). Typical activities include throwing pie at MathSoc executives and/or popular professors, viewing mathematics-related films, competing in pi recitation contests, and eating pie (on 22/7, cake is served instead, which is approximately pie).\n\nToday, the Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) community invites people all around the globe to join forces during the “World Primary Immunodeficiency Week” (22-29th April) to raise awareness about PI and advocate for positive changes that will ensure a timely testing and diagnosis of the diseases.\nPI is a growing category of over 350 forms of rare, genetic deficiencies of the immune system, increasing one’s susceptibility to a wide range of infections that can be life-threatening and affect different parts of the body including the skin, ears, lungs, intestines.\nCelebrated for the first time in 2010, the global disease awareness campaign World PI Week gathers patients and patient organisations, families, healthcare professionals, scientists, industry and policy-makers on all continents to enhance the understanding and political recognition of these rare diseases. The 2018 edition starts today and focuses on early testing and diagnosis of PI, which are crucial first steps for a successful care pathway and management of these diseases, estimated to affect over six million people worldwide.\nAlthough medical research and progress over the last six decades have helped to develop life-saving treatments, such as immunoglobulin replacement therapies, bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy, and contributed to greater understanding and knowledge of the diseases, it is estimated that around 70-90% of people living with the different forms of PI remain undiagnosed.\nDiagnosing PI is complex due to the similarity of symptoms with those of “common” infections. The relatively low awareness of PI among healthcare professionals and the general public, the lack of diagnostic facilities and the variety of these inherited genetic disorders often lead to diagnostic delays. Misdiagnosis or under diagnosis followed by an inappropriate treatment can leave patients in a vulnerable situation, with recurring infections, severe and permanent organ damage, physical disability or even death. But people with PI can be cured with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which remain the keys to successful care. Recent advances in gene technology have contributed to better diagnosis, though genetic testing is still unavailable in various parts of the world. On World PI Week, the PI community encourages healthcare authorities, payers, healthcare professionals, patients and the general public to engage and establish a policy framework to drive greater public awareness of PI and education both among primary and specialist care providers, to develop better diagnostic facilities, ensure an improved availability of screening tests for healthcare providers and guarantee equal, universal patient access to them.\nEngage in World PI Week: download the World PI Week materials on the campaign’s website, learn more about the activities held in the different parts of the world being public lectures & information sessions, walks, family and community initiatives, social media activities, press conferences, media events and join!\n\nQuestion: how long have we been celebrating pi day\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The awards include $50.5 million for state-of-the-art training equipment and technology, such as e-learning tools, video, audio and interactive learning systems and simulators.\nSix areas are targeted: primary care workforce training, oral health workforce training, equipment to enhance training across the health professions, loan repayments for health professionals, health careers opportunity programs for disadvantaged students, and patient navigator outreach and chronic disease prevention in health disparity populations.\nThe grants include $88.7 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\"An adequate healthcare workforce is the linchpin for reforming our healthcare system to ensure greater access, improve the quality of healthcare and cut overall costs in the long term,\" said Sebelius. \"Today's awards not only will provide more training opportunities for people interested in a health professions career, but also will support equipment purchases and faculty development to expand and enhance the quality of training.\"\n\"With an aging and increasingly diverse population, we need to prepare our health professionals to meet the challenges of providing healthcare in the 21st century,\" said Mary K. Wakefield, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which oversees the programs. \"This includes ensuring diversity in the workforce, and that well-trained professionals practice in areas of severe need.\"\nGrants will support family medicine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics programs, including curriculum development, faculty development, didactic and community-based education, and training in underserved areas for primary care residents, pre-doctoral students, interdisciplinary and inter-professional graduate students, and physician assistant students.\nFunding will target workforce development programs for pre- and post-doctoral training for dental residents; dental faculty; loan repayment for faculty who teach primary care dentistry; and training for practicing dentists, or other approved dental trainees in general, pediatric, and public health dentistry and dental hygiene programs. Funding also includes $4.3 million to states to provide nine new grantees the opportunity to address their states' unique oral health workforce needs in underserved urban and rural areas. Grants are designed to strengthen the delivery of multidisciplinary comprehensive oral health care, integral to quality primary care.\nFunding from the Recovery Act will provide 208 awards to assist with purchasing equipment for training current and future health professionals across disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate, and post- graduate education levels. Awardees include academic health centers, area health education centers, centers of excellence, and other educational institutions that serve underserved and uninsured patient populations, rural communities, and minorities. Equipment purchases will expand current training capabilities by replacing outdated equipment and technology or purchasing equipment that previously was unaffordable.\nTypes of equipment to be purchased include e-learning tools such as video, audio and interactive learning systems that provide more distance learning opportunities; human patient simulators that give students the opportunity to improve clinical judgment and critical thinking; and mobile dental vans that provide training in delivering care to diverse segments of the population while bringing basic routine dental treatments to families unable to access care. It is estimated that more than 200,000 individuals will be trained, including health professions students, faculty and clinical practice providers.\nTwenty-nine grants will be made to states that provide matching funds to assist health professionals in repaying their educational loans. In return, these individuals agree to provide full-time primary health services in federal health professional shortage areas for a minimum of two years. Health professionals eligible to receive funding include physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician assistants, psychologists, and social workers.\nThree grantees will receive funding to increase diversity in the health professions by developing an educational pipeline to enhance the academic performance of economically and educationally disadvantaged students, and prepare them for careers in the health professions. Eligible applicants included schools of medicine, public health, dentistry, pharmacy, allied health, and graduate programs in behavioral or mental health.\nFunding will support 10 grants for patient navigator outreach and chronic disease prevention programs, typically supported by healthcare information technology, to develop and operate patient navigator services that improve healthcare outcomes for individuals with cancer or other chronic diseases, with specific emphasis on health disparity populations.\nGrant recipients recruit, train, and employ patient navigators with direct knowledge of the communities they serve to coordinate care for patients with chronic illnesses. Eligible applicants include federally qualified health centers, health facilities operated through Indian Health Service contracts, hospitals, rural health clinics, and academic health centers.\nI had the pleasure of participating in a small symposium on quality in e-learning last week, organized by Athabasca University and the International Council for Distance Education. One of the things that bothers me about the quality issue is that only seems to reach the top of the agenda when e-learning is involved. The discussion seems to always start from the premise that the quality of e-learning is inherently suspect and we need to ensure it meets the same standard as our face-to-face instruction. In fact, there are no system-wide quality standards for teaching and learning in higher education and most higher education institutions rely almost entirely on student satisfaction and graduation rates as their measures of education quality.\nComing back to my opening point, what strikes me about both these frameworks, and the quality in e-learning discussion more generally, is that most of the issues are also directly applicable to all teaching and learning. So if we are going to focus on quality and invest time and effort in developing standards, let's make sure they are not just applied to e-learning.\nRekkedal, T.

Bekkestua, NKI.\nAlthough it's still a small segment of the overall ed tech market in the United States, mobile learning is growing in colleges and universities. According to new data released by market research firm Ambient Insightthis week, that growth is projected to be in the double digits in terms of dollar expenditures through 2014, driven by e-readers and mobile versions of learning management systems.\nSome of the inhibitors for the growth of commercial mobile learning technologies in higher ed, according to the report, include free content oniTunes U and the development of free, home-grown mobile learning platforms at both individual schools and large education networks, such asAbilene Christian University, Boston University School of Management,Bridgepoint Education, Career Education Corp., and Walden University(part of Laureate International Universities Network).\n\"A major catalyst in this segment is the emergence of native platforms designed for the higher education market,\" the report said. \"For example, the products from Inkling, Emantras, Irynsoft, Blackboard, Multiply IT, andStreaMe are being marketed heavily to the academic buyers, particularly the higher education buyers.\"\nHowever, players in open source are also helping to drive growth, according to the forecast. \"The integration of mobile technology into popular open source platforms is also acting as a catalyst in the higher education segment. In July 2010, Moodlerooms and DubMeNowannounced a new platform called joule Mobile, 'an application that will extend the online classroom and deliver on-the-go access to joule, Moodlerooms’ enterprise learning management platform.' The platform is middleware supporting multiple mobile platforms, including Apple iPhone, RIM Blackberry, Android, Symbian, and Windows Mobile.\"\nNew tablet and e-reader device suppliers, including enTourage, Kno, andMobifusion, are also driving growth, Ambient Insight said.\nHe further explained: \"As you know, CourseSmart is a joint venture among leading educational publishers including Pearson, Cengage Learning,McGraw-Hill Education, Bedford, Freeman & Worth Publishing Group(Macmillan), and John Wiley & Sons. In the last year, they have completely overhauled their retail site as a Web store selling mobile learning directly to students. The iPhone/iPad viewer apps are free in the Apple App Store, but the fee-based mobile content is Web-based. They are bypassing the Apple App Store and the college book stores. ... [A]gain, it is too soon to tell, but this looks like an end run around the college bookstore ecosystem.\"\n\n Though Bush generally refrained from making major proposals for new domestic programs, he stated his intention to be an education and environmental president. A 1983 report, titled A Nation at Risk, had raised concern about the quality of the American educational system. Bush proposed the Educational Excellence Act of 1989, a plan to reward high-performing schools with federal grants and provide support for the establishment of magnet schools. Bush's education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations, such as open enrollment, incentive pay for outstanding teachers, and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children. Conservatives, who generally sought to shrink the role of the federal government in education, opposed the bill. Liberals opposed the proposed vouchers for private \n\n were wary of the student testing designed to ensure higher educational standards, and favored higher levels of federal spending on educational programs for minorities and the economically disadvantaged. Bush believed that educational costs should primarily be borne by state and local governments, and he did not favor dramatically raising the overall level of federal funding for education. Because of the lack of support from both liberals and conservatives, Congress did not act on his education proposals. Bush later introduced the voluntary \"America 2000\" program, which sought to rally business leaders and local governments around education reform. Though Bush did not pass a major educational reform package during his presidency, his ideas influenced later reform efforts, including Goals 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\n According to Simons, he founded the program to address failures in the US education system to produce students highly qualified in STEM skills and knowledge, which reduces America's ability to compete in the global economy. He perceived the cause of the failure as low quality teachers, and saw that problem in turn as being caused by low salaries, lack of prestige, and lack of support and good training making the job unattractive to qualified candidates, many of whom could get jobs in lucrative fields like quantitative finance. He created the program to provide math and science teachers with higher salaries \n\n program for free tuition at community colleges. In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama proposed making community college tuition free to many residents of the US. Despite its popularity, the plan did not materialize. In September 2015, the College Promise Campaign was started, which serves to educate and promote College Promise programs in the United States. At that time, there were 53 College Promise Programs in place. By 2017, 16 states had at least one statewide College Promise program. A year later, the College Promise movement grew to over 300 programs in 24 states. As of September 2019, it was observed that there are over 320 College Promise Programs in 47 states nationwide.\n\nQuestion: who started the state of the union address\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Although they were the first franchise to appear in four Super Bowls, they lost each time and became the first franchise to lose four Super Bowls as a result. They had not appeared in a Super Bowl since their fourth loss following the 1976 season, although they had come close in other seasons. In a 1975 Divisional round playoff game, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys as a result of a 50-yard touchdown pass from Roger Staubach to \n\n The previous playoff meeting between the two teams was the 2009 NFC Championship game, which was notable for the excessive roughness of the Saints, later termed \"Bountygate,\" as well as the Vikings driving close to a game-winning field goal before quarterback Brett Favre threw an interception. Some Minneapolis sportswriters have described the \"Miracle\" as atoning for Bountygate. Prior to the 2016 season, Minnesota's starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater suffered a non-contact injury that produced a dislocated knee, torn ACL and \"other structural damage.\" The severity of the injury nearly cost Bridgewater his leg and compelled the Vikings to trade two draft picks to the Philadelphia Eagles for Sam Bradford as a replacement. The Vikings began 2016 with a 5–0 record before \n\n The 2009 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 49th in the National Football League and their fourth under head coach Brad Childress. The Vikings improved upon their 10–6 record and defended their NFC North title from 2008, their first successful defense of a divisional title since they won six NFC Central titles in a row between 1973 and 1978. They beat the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Divisional Playoff at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, but lost the NFC Championship Game in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints, missing out on what would have been their first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XI in 1976. This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the \"Bountygate Game\" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season.\n\n to their ninth NFC Championship Game in team history, and their first appearance since the 2000 season with a 13–4 record. Brett Favre became the oldest player to start and win a playoff game, but also won his first postseason game in four against Dallas.

He ran for re-election in 2010 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Mo Brooks. Griffith ran against Brooks in a rematch in 2012 but was defeated by a larger margin. He returned to the Democratic Party in 2014 and unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election.\n\nEarly life, education, and medical career\nGriffith was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He taught 7th-grade arithmetic for less than a year at T.H. Harris Junior High School (later Middle School) in Metairie in Jefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans prior to being admitted to medical school. He received his medical degree from the Louisiana State University Medical School in 1970 and served in residency at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. After serving at the LSU Service Charity Hospital in New Orleans and a year of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas, Griffith began preparing to become a radiation oncologist, one who specializes in using radiation to cure cancer, training in radiation oncology through a combined program between UTMB and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He served as a Medical Corps captain in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1970 to 1973, while continuing his medical training at the LSU Service Charity Hospital in New Orleans.\n\nGriffith was recruited on a \"cold call\" to Alabama and established the Huntsville Cancer Treatment Center. As a physician, he provided discounted care to patients who lacked insurance. Griffith also conducted several clinical trials in conjunction with the University of Alabama School of Medicine, and partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. He retired from medicine in December 1992, though he still holds a license to practice in both Alabama and Texas.\n\nEarly political career\nGriffith unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Huntsville against the three-term incumbent,  Loretta Spencer in 2004. He then won a seat in the Alabama State Senate, representing the 7th district. He carried 66% of the vote to his opponent's 34%.\n\nDuring his term in the State Senate, he sponsored bills to promote investment in alternative fuels, cut taxes, and establish a Statewide Trauma Care System to speed critical medical care.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nElections\n2008\n\nOn March 22, 2008 Griffith announced that he would run for the open seat in the 5th District. The district's 9-term incumbent, fellow Democrat Bud Cramer, was not running for reelection. He won the June 2008 Democratic primary election with 90% of the vote, defeating physicist David Maker. Cramer had endorsed Griffith in the primary.\n\nGriffith faced Republican Wayne Parker, an insurance agent from Huntsville, in the November election. Parker had sought this seat unsuccessfully twice before, in 1994 and 1996, losing both times to Bud Cramer.\n\nThe 5th was considered one of the few realistic chances for a Republican pickup in what was forecast to be a very bleak year for Republicans because of the district's and state's recent voting history.  While Democrats still held most local offices as well as most state legislative seats in the area, the district's residents had become increasingly willing to support Republicans at the national and state level. It last supported a Democrat for president in 1984, and George W. Bush and John McCain won the district by wide double-digit margins in 2000, 2004 and, ultimately, 2008.\n\nDue to these trends, most forecasters rated the district as a toss-up. CQ Politics forecast the race as 'No Clear Favorite', The Cook Political Report ranked it 'Democratic Toss-Up', and The Rothenberg Political Report rated it 'Pure Toss-Up'.\n\nGriffith prevailed by taking 52 percent of the vote to Parker's 48 percent. He carried all but one of the district's seven counties. This came even as McCain (who carried the 5th with 61 percent of the vote) and Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions (whose seat was up for re-election) won every county in the district.  His victory, and that of Bobby Bright in the 2nd District, gave Alabama two white Democratic congressmen for the first time since Glen Browder and Tom Bevill left the House in 1997.\n\n2010\n\nGriffith ran for re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican in 2010, but was defeated in the June 1 Republican primary by Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks. Brooks received 51% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a run-off. Griffith received 33%. Conservative activist Les Phillip received 16%.\n\n2012\n\nIn January 2012, he filed for a rematch against Brooks in the Republican primary. He said of the incumbent, \"We'll contrast my time in Congress with my opponent's time in Congress. The distinction is clear, he has wandered away from many of the issues people want us to address.\" Brooks defeated him in the rematch 71%–29%, a landslide margin of 42 points. He won all five of the counties.\n\n2014\n\nSupporters of Griffith circulated petitions to place him on the November ballot as an Independent. Griffith considered running but decided against it.\n\nTenure\nGriffith has stated that he leans conservative on a variety of issues, though not all. He states he is a fiscal conservative who has called repeatedly for reducing the national debt. He is a strong supporter of NASA and America's dominance in space.\n\nGriffith voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act, cap-and-trade legislation and the 2009 economic stimulus act.\n\nParty switch\nGriffith was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, but on December 22, 2009, he announced he would become a Republican. He cited the health care bill as a major reason for his switch, and he had also clashed with the Democrats over fiscal and foreign policy. During his announcement, he stated:\n\nI believe our nation is at a crossroads and I can no longer align myself with a party that continues to pursue legislation that is bad for our country, hurts our economy, and drives us further and further into debt.\n\nThe GOP had been courting Griffith since August, when he publicly criticized the Democratic House leadership in the wake of raucous town hall meetings in his district, stating that he wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker as she is \"divisive and polarizing\". He also opposed the White House's decision to cancel a missile defense shield in Europe, which could have contributed to Huntsville's defense industry. His switch is the first time a member of Congress switched from the majority party to the minority party since New York Representative Michael Forbes' switch from Republican to Democrat in 1999. Forbes also lost his primary campaign following his switch. The 5th was one of the few districts in the former Confederacy that, at the time, had not elected a Republican since Reconstruction.\n\nIn January 2010, rebelling against his party switch, Griffith's congressional staff resigned en masse, including his chief of staff, legislative director, press secretary, and his intern. Shortly after switching parties, Griffith joined the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans.\n\nGriffith's voting record veered sharply to the right after his switch.  He'd garnered a 56 from the American Conservative Union in 2009, but in 2010 garnered a 95.\n\nUpon Griffith's party switch, he became the first Republican to represent Alabama's 5th district since John Benton Callis, who was elected to a single term (1868-1870) during Reconstruction.\n\nCommittee assignments\n Committee on Energy and Commerce\n Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet\n Subcommittee on Energy and Environment\n Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations\n\nCaucus memberships\n Missile Defense (co-chair)\n Modeling and Simulation\n NASA House Action Committee\n\n2014 gubernatorial election\n\nGriffith ran for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election. He returned to the Democratic Party in February 2014, with the State Party voting to reinstate him.  He was successful in obtaining the party's nomination but lost decisively to the incumbent, Robert J. Bentley, in the general election.\n\nElectoral history\n\nPersonal life\nGriffith resides in Huntsville with his wife, Virginia. The couple has five children and 11 grandchildren (to date). He co-founded the Griffith Family Foundation, which awards cash grants to elementary school libraries in northern Alabama. Since its founding in 2005, the foundation has donated over $50,000 to area schools.\n\nSee also\n List of American politicians who switched parties in office\n List of United States representatives who switched parties\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Parker Griffith for Governor\n \n \n \n Collected news and commentary from Politico\n Parker Griffith Family Foundation\n\n|-\n\n1942 births\n20th-century American physicians\n21st-century American politicians\nBusinesspeople from Alabama\nAmerican Episcopalians\nAmerican oncologists\nAlabama Democrats\nAlabama Independents\nAlabama Republicans\nAlabama state senators\nLiving people\nLouisiana State University alumni\nMembers of the United States House of Representatives from Alabama\nPoliticians from Huntsville, Alabama\nPoliticians from Shreveport, Louisiana\nPeople from Metairie, Louisiana\nRepublican Party members of the United States House of Representatives\n\n The 2018 United States House of Representatives elections were held on November 6, 2018, with early voting taking place in some states in the weeks preceding that date. Voters chose representatives from all 435 congressional districts across each of the 50 U.S. states. Non-voting delegates from the District of Columbia and four of the five inhabited U.S. territories were also elected. These midterm elections took place halfway through the term of Republican President Donald Trump. On Election Day, Republicans had held a House majority since January 2011. In the 2018 elections, the Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, won control of the House. The Democrats gained a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections. The 41-seat gain was the Democrats' largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate 1974 elections, when they picked up 49 seats. Upon the opening of the 116th United States Congress, Pelosi was elected as Speaker of the House. Incumbent Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan chose not to run for another term. In November 2018, House Republicans elected Kevin McCarthy as House Minority Leader.\n\n 2010 election resulted in the highest losses by a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. Republicans made their largest gain in House seats since 1938. Three Democratic committee chairman were defeated, Transportation chairman Jim Oberstar of Minnesota, Armed Services chairman Ike Skelton of Missouri, and most notably Budget chairman John Spratt of South Carolina. Democrats made three pick-ups, winning an open seat in Delaware and defeating Republican incumbents in Hawaii and Louisiana. The heavy Democratic Party losses in 2010 were attributed to anger at President Obama, opposition to the Affordable Care Act and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, large budget deficits, and the weak economy.\n\n Democrats. Democrats defeated 22 Republican incumbents and won eight open Republican-held seats. For the first time since the party's founding, Republicans won no seats previously held by Democrats and defeated no Democratic incumbents. It was the largest seat gain for the Democrats since the 1974 elections. Among the new Democrats were the first Muslim in Congress (Keith Ellison) and the first two Buddhists (Mazie Hirono and Hank Johnson). As a result of the Democratic victory, Nancy Pelosi became the first woman and the first Californian House Speaker. , these remain the only House elections in U.S. history where only one party flipped any seats. 2006 remains the last year in which Republicans won a house race in Connecticut.\n\n worked to oust candidates who would not refuse funding from the fossil fuel industry and to elect proponents of renewable energy.

During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live in an interview with Entertainment Weekly a week after \"Immortality\" aired. He explained \"I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but last week we did not have a good week, ratings wise.

On August 13, 2020, Epic released a version of Fortnite that included a permanent discount on V-bucks across all platforms, but for those on iOS and Android devices, only if they purchased directly through Epic, bypassing Apple and Google's storefronts. Both Apple and Google immediately delisted the game for violating the storefronts' terms of service by including their own storefront, which led Epic to file lawsuits against both companies the same day, accusing them of antitrust behavior in how they operate their app stores.\n\n Games, which had been valued at around US$825 million at the time of Tencent's acquisition, was estimated to be worth US$4.5 billion in July 2018 due to Fortnite Battle Royale, and expected to surpass US$8.5 billion by the end of 2018 with projected growth of the game.

Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of Fortnite and released it as Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017. While free-to-play, the game was supported by microtransactions. Fortnite Battle Royale rapidly became popular, and by June 2018, with the game ported to computer, consoles, and mobile devices, had reached 125 million players. Total 2018 revenue for Fortnite Battle Royale was estimated at US$2.4 billion by analysis firm SuperData Research. Epic designated US$100 million of these revenues to position Fortnite Battle Royale as an esport. The inaugural Fortnite World Cup was first announced in February 2019. While Epic planned to run the event in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led Epic to cancel the event for the year, though will still hold other Fortnite seasonal championship events known as Fortnite Champion Series.\n\n By July 2017, Fortnite was finally in a state for public play. Epic launched the title through a paid early access then, with a full free-to-play release expected in 2018. Following on the popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, a battle royale game released earlier in 2017, Epic developed a variant of Fortnite called Fortnite Battle Royale, which was released in September 2017 as a free-to-play title across computer, console, and mobile platforms.

Turner's camera used a rotating disk of three color filters to photograph color separations on one roll of black-and-white film. A red, green or blue-filtered image was recorded on each successive frame of film. The finished film print was projected, three frames at a time, through the corresponding color filters. When Turner died in 1903, his financial backer at that time, pioneering film \n\n projectors were installed in some 300 cinemas in Britain, and 54 dramatic films were produced. Four dramatic short films were made in Kinemacolor in the US in 1912–1913, and one in Japan in 1914. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors. A variant method was promoted by William Friese-Greene. He called his additive color system \"Biocolour\". It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes. An ordinary projector could therefore be used, if \n\n motion picture film, but it proved to be mechanically impractical. A simplified two-color version, introduced as Kinemacolor in 1908, was marginally successful for a few years, but the special projector it required and its inherent major technical defects contributed to its demise in 1914. Technicolor, originally also a two-color process capable of only a limited range of hues, was commercialized in 1922 and soon became the most widely used of the several two-color processes available in the 1920s. Beginning in 1932, Technicolor introduced a new full-color process, \"Process 4\", now commonly called \"three-strip Technicolor\" because the special camera used for live-action filming yielded separate black-and-white negatives for each of the three primary colors. The final print, however, was a single full-color strip of film that did not need any special handling. This became the standard process used by the major Hollywood studios until the mid-1950s.\n\n In 1927, Warner Bros. released the first feature-length film with sound, The Jazz Singer, whose audio track was recorded with a proprietary technology called Vitaphone. The film's success persuaded other studios to go to the considerable expense of adding microphones to their sets, and scramble to start producing their own \"talkies\". One of the next major advancements made in movie production was color film. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Early techniques included hand tinting: painting each frame by hand. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a single color, used in many films in the 1920s. The film \n\n all-color feature in \"New Technicolor\" was Becky Sharp (1935). The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number had risen to over 50 percent. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. The last stand of black-and-white films made by or released through the major Hollywood studios came in the mid-1960s, after which the use of color film for all productions was effectively mandatory and exceptions were only rarely and grudgingly made.\n\nQuestion: when did movies start coming out in color\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In Dylan and Cohen: Poets of Rock and Roll, he applied hermeneutic and aesthetic theories to the lyric poetry of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, in order to explore the political culture of their day. Boucher analysed Dylan’s and Cohen’s songs in terms of three aesthetic theories, those of Collingwood, Oakeshott and Lorca, in order to differentiate the types of expressions the songs convey to suggest that certain kinds of response are inappropriate to some songs, but may be appropriate to others. This book has been translated into six languages, including Spanish, Serbian and Polish. It has been re-issued following the death of Leonard Cohen and the conferment of the Nobel Prize for Literature on Bob Dylan. Boucher extended this research to explore the relationship with Bob Dylan, the Beats, and Dylan Thomas. Boucher’s most recent work in this area has appeared in The Journal of Popular Music (2013) and Symbiosis (2016). His most recent book is Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen: Deaths and Entrances authored with Lucy Boucher.\n\n Michael Bernard Bloomfield (July 28, 1943 – February 15, 1981) was an American guitarist and composer, born in Chicago, Illinois, who became one of the first popular music superstars of the 1960s to earn his reputation almost entirely on his instrumental prowess, as he rarely sang before 1969. Respected for his guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues musicians before achieving his own fame and was instrumental in popularizing blues music in the mid-1960s. In 1965, he played on Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, including the single \"Like a Rolling Stone\", and performed with Dylan at that year's Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield was ranked No. 22 on Rolling Stone's list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2003 and No. 42 by the same magazine in 2011. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012 and, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\n Tempest is the 35th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on September 10, 2012, by Columbia Records. The album was recorded at Jackson Browne's Groove Masters Studios in Santa Monica, California. Dylan wrote all of the songs himself with the exception of \"Duquesne Whistle\", which he co-wrote with longtime Grateful Dead associate Robert Hunter. Tempest was released to acclaim from music critics, who praised its traditional music influences and Dylan's dark lyrics. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Tempest was Dylan's last album to feature original material until his 2020 album Rough and Rowdy Ways.\n\n \"Blowin' in the Wind\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962. It was released as a single and included on his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan in 1963. It has been described as a protest song and poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war, and freedom. The refrain \"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\" has been described as \"impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind\". In 1994, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

On August 17, 1963, it reached number two on the Billboard pop chart, with sales exceeding one million copies. Peter Yarrow recalled that, when he told Dylan he would make more than $5,000 from the publishing rights, Dylan was speechless. Peter, Paul and Mary's version of the song also spent five weeks atop the easy listening chart. The critic Andy Gill wrote, \"\"Blowin' in the Wind\" marked a huge jump in Dylan's songwriting. Prior to this, efforts like \"The Ballad of Donald White\" and \"The Death of Emmett Till\" had been fairly simplistic bouts of reportage songwriting. \n\nQuestion: who wrote knock knock knocking on heavens door\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Midshipmen ranked in the top five teams in the Associated Press \n\n The bowl was first played in December 2003, featuring two ranked teams, No. 18 Boise State and No. 19 TCU. It was the only edition to include a ranked team (per the AP Poll) until No. 22 Army played in December 2018. In 2010 and 2011 when Amon G. Carter Stadium underwent a reconstruction project, the bowl was moved to Gerald J. Ford Stadium in nearby University Park, Texas. Through the December 2018 playing, one of the three FBS-playing service academies (Army, Navy, and Air Force) has appeared in the game ten times. Contractual tie-ins with the American Athletic Conference (home of Navy), the Mountain West Conference (home of Air Force) and independent Army assures that one of those schools could appear in the game every year, if bowl-eligible and not already committed to another bowl. The 2018 game, between Army and Houston, was the first sellout in the bowl's 16-year history.\n\n Army and Navy first met on the field on November 29, 1890, and have met annually since 1930. The game has been held at several locations throughout its history, including New York City and Baltimore, but has most frequently been played in Philadelphia, roughly equidistant from the two academies. Historically played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving (a date on which most other major college football teams end their regular seasons), the game is now played on the second Saturday in December and is traditionally the last regular-season game played in NCAA Division I football. For much of the first two thirds of the 20th century, both Army and Navy were often national \n\n This year's Army-Navy Game uniforms for the Navy Midshipmen spotlight Naval Aviation, namely the carrier-based F/A-18 Super Hornet in a themed uniform named \"Fly Navy\".

On the left upper chest is a triangular squadron patch highlighting the Strike Fighter Wing, U.S. Atlantic Fleet based out of Naval Air Station in Oceana, Virginia.

The Black Knights, or Cadets, and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources. As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces. The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado.

In the human brain the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The midbrain is continuous with the thalamus of the diencephalon through the tentorial notch, and sometimes the diencephalon is included in the brainstem. The brainstem is very small, making up around only 2.6 percent of the brain's total weight. It has the critical roles of regulating cardiac, and respiratory function, helping to control heart rate and breathing rate. It also provides the main motor and sensory nerve supply to the face and neck via the cranial nerves. Ten pairs of cranial nerves come from the brainstem. Other roles include the regulation of the central nervous system and the body's sleep cycle. It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch).\n\nSome of the functional properties of the brain include information processing, motor control, sensory perception, memory storage and retrieval, emotions, and cognitive functions. Neurons play a crucial role in these functions by transmitting electrical signals and information throughout the brain.\n\nNeurons are specialized cells that receive and transmit information. They receive input from other neurons through dendritic connections and process this information. Neurons can receive input from multiple sources and integrate these signals to determine their response. \n\nThe electrical signals in neurons, known as action potentials, are generated when the neuron reaches a certain threshold. These action potentials are then transmitted along the length of the neuron, which can vary in length and complexity. Some neurons can extend up to three feet, allowing them to transmit information over long distances in the brain.\n\nNeurons communicate with each other through synapses, which are specialized connections between neurons. At the synapse, information is transmitted from one neuron to another using neurotransmitters. Different neurons can release different neurotransmitters, and the type of neurotransmitter released determines the response of the receiving neuron. This helps in determining whether a neuron is excitatory (causing an increase in electrical activity) or inhibitory (causing a decrease in electrical activity).\n\nNeurons also form networks and systems within the brain. They are organized in a highly structured manner, forming connections and pathways that allow information to be transmitted between different areas of the brain. These networks and systems are responsible for coordinating various functions and activities in the brain.\n\nOverall, neurons are vital for the functioning of the brain. They receive, process, and transmit information, allowing for the complex functions and processes that occur in the brain.\n\n usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. In some species, axons can emanate from dendrites known as axon-carrying dendrites. No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, \n\n Brain cells make up the functional tissue of the brain. The rest of the brain tissue is structural or connective called the stroma which includes blood vessels. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Neurons are the excitable cells of the brain that function by communicating with other neurons and interneurons (via synapses), in neural circuits and larger brain networks. The two main neuronal classes in the cerebral cortex are excitatory projection neurons, and inhibitory interneurons; around 70-80 per cent are neurons, and 20-30 per cent inhibitory interneurons. Neurons are often grouped into a cluster known as a nucleus where they usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. Glia are the supporting cells of the neurons and have many functions not all of which are clearly understood, but include providing support and nutrients to the neurons. Glia are grouped into macroglia of astrocytes, ependymal cells, and oligodendrocytes, and much small microglia. Astrocytes are seen to be capable of communication with neurons involving a signalling process similar to neurotransmission called gliotransmission.\n\nThe functional components of a neuron include the cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. The cell body, also known as the perikaryon, contains the nucleus and other organelles that maintain the cell. The processes extending from the cell body, such as the axon and dendrites, are responsible for transmitting information.\n\nAxons are long, thin fibers that carry nerve impulses away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands. They transmit information in the form of electrical signals called action potentials. Axons can vary in length, with some reaching up to a meter long in the human body. \n\nDendrites, on the other hand, receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. These short, branching projections allow neurons to receive and integrate information from multiple sources.\n\nSynaptic junctions are specialized structures where communication occurs between neurons. They connect the axon of one neuron to the dendrites or cell body of another neuron, forming synapses. Neurotransmitters, chemical messengers, are released at these synapses to transmit signals from one neuron to another.\n\nNeurons transmit different types of information to the brain. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors (found in the skin, eyes, ears, etc.) to the brain, conveying information about the external environment. Motor neurons, on the other hand, transmit signals from the brain or spinal cord to muscles or glands, resulting in movement or secretion. Interneurons, also known as intercalated neurons, form a network within the central nervous system, allowing for communication and integration between sensory and motor neurons.\n\nIn summary, neurons are composed of a cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. They transmit information through electrical signals along the axon, receive signals through dendrites, and communicate with other neurons through synapses. This intricate system facilitates the transmission of various types of information, including sensory input and motor output, ultimately allowing for the functioning of the nervous system.\n\nQuestion: dendrites and cell bodies are components of what type of matter found in the brain\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the time, it was one of the highest suspension bridges in the world 627 ft above the original streambed), but with the creation of the lake, the bridge now sits just above the water level when the lake is full. The bridge is signed as part of State Route 162. The original bridge is registered as a California Historical Landmark and it was declared a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Mother Orange Tree, the first orange tree in Northern California (purchased by Judge Lewis), is located near the California landmark commemorative plaque.\n\n The bridge was built for the Panama–California Exposition of 1915. It provided the main access across Cabrillo Canyon (formerly known as Pound Canyon, which was used to hold cattle and horses in the late 19th century). An initial design for the bridge was developed by Bertram Goodhue that featured three large arches. The design was to be similar to Toledo, Spain's Alcántara Bridge. However, Frank P. Allen Jr. convinced Balboa Park commissioners to choose a cheaper design by Thomas B. Hunter of San Francisco that looked similar to other bridges in Mexico and Spain. The innovative design featured a multiple-arched cantilever structure, the first such bridge in California. Building began in December 1912 under the supervision of Allen. The concrete forms were made of 1000000 board feet of wood, mostly redwood. The length of the bridge is 916 ft including approaches. The main span is 450 ft long and 120 ft high. The seven arches are each 56 ft across and are supported by fourteen hollow concrete pillars. The bridge's construction cost reached $250,000 ($0 today).\n\n a pioneer in road construction.

As part of both US Highway 101 and California Route 1, it connects the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County. The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when completed in 1937, and is an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco and California in general. Since its completion 85.51127516996448 years ago, the span length has been surpassed by eight other bridges. It is the second longest suspension bridge main span in the United States, after the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge (1964) in New York City. In 2007, it was ranked fifth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.\n\n The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the 1 mi strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Being declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917. The Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as \"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\" At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 4,200 ft and a total height of 746 ft.\n\nQuestion: how long is the famous suspension bridge in san francisco and what is it called\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Producer Don Hahn claims the dress was conceived by several intoxicated male filmmakers during production of the film. Although Beauty and the Beast is set in 18th-century France, the dress's streamlined, anachronistic design borrows inspiration from several different fashion eras, with some of its elements centuries removed from its historical setting. Although art director Brian McEntee had always envisioned the dress as gold, representing Belle's emotional growth into a happier, warmer character, Disney's marketing department wanted a pink dress to appeal to young girls; McEntee convinced the studio that gold would differentiate Belle from previous Disney princesses. The dress has been reimagined \n\n Belle is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991).

It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.\n\n Article I, section 8, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads, which has been interpreted as a de facto Congressional monopoly over the delivery of first-class residential mail—which has been defined as non-urgent residential letters (not packages). Accordingly, no other system for delivering first-class residential mail—public or private—has been tolerated, absent Congress's consent. The mission of the Postal Service is to provide the American public with trusted universal postal service. While not explicitly defined, the Postal Service's universal service obligation (USO) is broadly outlined in statute and includes multiple dimensions: geographic scope, range of products, access to services and facilities, delivery frequency, affordable and uniform \n\n 1872, and was transformed by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 into the United States Postal Service as an independent agency. Since the early 1980s, many direct tax subsidies to the USPS (with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with disabled and overseas voters) have been reduced or eliminated. The USPS has a monopoly on \"letter\" delivery within the United States and operates under a universal service obligation (USO), both of which are defined across a broad set of legal mandates, which obligate it to provide uniform price and quality across the entirety of its service area. The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked \"U.S. Mail\" and personal letterboxes in the United States, but has to compete against private package delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, FedEx, and Amazon.\n\n the United States but is part of the Government, and so is not controlled by the antitrust laws\" such as the Sherman Antitrust Act. Unlike a state-owned enterprise, the USPS lacks a transparent ownership structure and isn't subject to standard rules and norms that apply to commercial entities. The USPS also lacks commercial discretion and control. The U.S. Supreme Court has also upheld the USPS's statutory monopoly on access to letter boxes against a First Amendment freedom of speech challenge; it thus remains illegal in the U.S. for anyone, other than the employees and agents of the USPS, to deliver mailpieces to letter boxes marked \"U.S. Mail\". The Postal Service also has a Mailers' Technical Advisory Committee and local Postal Customer Councils, which are advisory and primarily involve business customers.\n\n divested local companies continued to be protected in lesser degree from competition in the local exchange market as a public utility. National Postal, telegraph and telephone service monopolies were enforced in many countries until the late 20th century. Telstra, for example, had a legal monopoly on telecommunications in Australia. As do the Post Office departments in many countries, the United States Postal Service has a legal monopoly on delivery of non-overnight letters. In many cities bus service enjoys a legal monopoly, however some city governments have legalized bus competition due to pressure from consumers who desire lower prices and entrepreneurs that would like to provide them.

The song was a number one hit on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts published by RPM, reaching its peak on both charts for the week of December 31, 1977. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: \"Lady\" in 1980 and \"You Were a Good Friend\" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor. Her version was also released as a single, reaching number 36 on the country music charts. At the time, it was her lowest-peaking single since \"(I Still Long to Hold You) Now and Then\" in 1980. Through the years the song has been covered by numerous other artists, including Tammy Wynette, Dottie West, Billie Jo Spears, Waylon Jennings, Anne Murray, Johnny Hallyday and Millie Jackson.\n\n \"Daytime Friends\" is a song written by Ben Peters and recorded by American country music artist Kenny Rogers. It was released in August 1977 as the lead single from the album of the same name. The song was Rogers' second number one country hit as a solo artist. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of twelve weeks on the country chart. The single's B-side, \"We Don't Make Love Anymore,\" was composed by Rogers and Marianne Gordon and later covered by Anne Murray and was released on her album Let's Keep It That Way. The single's German B-Side was Lying Again.\n\n \"I've Got Friends\" is a song by American indie rock band Manchester Orchestra. The song was released as the lead single from the band's second studio album Mean Everything to Nothing. The song was Manchester Orchestra's breakthrough hit, peaking at No. 8 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart in the summer of 2009. It was the band's first single to chart. Until 2017, \"I've Got Friends\" was Manchester Orchestra's only top-10 chart success and their highest-charting song; this feat was bested by \"The Gold\", which reached No. 1 on Billboard's Adult Alternative Songs chart. \"I've Got Friends\" was used in multiple video game soundtracks, such as MLB 11: The Show and Dirt 3, as well as in the television show The Vampire Diaries.\n\nQuestion: who sang the song you got a friend in me\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems. Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves. Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest. As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure. Some plants (e.g. bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable.\n\nThe integration of fixed and mobile modules in plants contributes to their individuality as organisms in various ways. The effective architecture of plants as modular systems with fixed and mobile elements allows for a coordinated functioning of different parts of the plant. \n\nBy integrating fixed structures such as the root system and the main stem, plants provide a stable foundation and structural support. The roots anchor the plant in the soil, absorbing water and nutrients necessary for its growth and development. Meanwhile, the main stem provides a framework for the plant and allows for upward growth towards sunlight.\n\nOn the other hand, the integration of mobile modules such as leaves, flowers, and branches brings flexibility and adaptability to plants. Leaves are responsible for photosynthesis, capturing sunlight and converting it into energy for the plant. Flowers, through their attractive color and fragrance, facilitate pollination by attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Branches enable the plant to expand its reach, explore new areas, and optimize resource acquisition.\n\nThe integration of these fixed and mobile modules into functional units plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. For instance, nutrition is facilitated by the roots and leaves working together. The roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil and transport them to the leaves, where photosynthesis occurs. The products of photosynthesis are then distributed to other parts of the plant, supporting growth and reproduction.\n\nDefense mechanisms are also enhanced through the integration of fixed and mobile modules. For example, thorns on branches and leaves act as deterrents to herbivores. When a herbivore tries to feed on a plant, it encounters physical resistance from these structures. Additionally, some plants produce chemical compounds in their leaves or flowers that act as natural pesticides or repellents against pests.\n\nThe integration of fixed and mobile modules is also crucial for plant reproduction. Flowers attract pollinators and provide a platform for the exchange of pollen, which leads to fertilization and the production of seeds. In some cases, the flowers themselves may undergo a mobile transformation, such as wilting after pollination or dispersing seeds through wind or animal assistance.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of fixed and mobile modules in plants allows for a coordinated functioning of different parts, promoting stability, adaptability, and reproductive success. This integration is essential for plants to thrive and exhibit their individuality as organisms.\n\n Stems are herbaceous, aerial, branched, and cylindrical with glandular hairs, generally erect, but can be prostrate to ascending. The stems can contain secretory canals with resin, or latex which is particularly common among the Cichorioideae.\n\n dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant. In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots. Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process of layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, \n\n Edible plant stems are one part of plants that are eaten by humans. Most plants are made up of stems, roots, leaves, flowers, and produce fruits containing seeds. Humans most commonly eat the seeds (e.g. maize, wheat),  fruit (e.g. tomato, avocado, banana), flowers (e.g. broccoli), leaves (e.g. lettuce, spinach, and cabbage), roots (e.g. carrots, beets), and stems (e.g. [asparagus] of many plants. There are also a few edible petioles (also known as leaf stems) such as celery or rhubarb. Plant stems have a variety of functions. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. Apical meristems, located at the shoot tip and axillary buds on the stem, allow plants to increase in length, surface, and mass. In some plants, such as cactus, stems are specialized for photosynthesis and water storage.\n\nQuestion: what are the main functions of the stem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Symptoms develop in close relation to the exposure. Absorption of a poison is necessary for systemic poisoning. Furthermore, many common household medications are not labeled with skull and crossbones, although they can cause severe illness or even death. Poisoning can be caused by excessive consumption of generally safe substances, as in the case of water intoxication. Agents that act on the nervous system can paralyze in seconds or less, and include both biologically derived neurotoxins and so-called nerve gases, which may be synthesized for warfare or industry. Inhaled or ingested cyanide, used as a method of execution in gas chambers, or as a suicide method, almost instantly starves the body \n\n energy by inhibiting the enzymes in mitochondria that make ATP. Intravenous injection of an unnaturally high concentration of potassium chloride, such as in the execution of prisoners in parts of the United States, quickly stops the heart by eliminating the cell potential necessary for muscle contraction. Most biocides, including pesticides, are created to act as acute poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms (secondary poisoning), including the humans who apply the biocides and other beneficial organisms. For example, the herbicide 2,4-D imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants. Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as \"harmful\" (EU). Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by \n\n In toxicology, the lethal dose (LD) is an indication of the lethal toxicity of a given substance or type of radiation. Because resistance varies from one individual to another, the \"lethal dose\" represents a dose (usually recorded as dose per kilogram of subject body weight) at which a given percentage of subjects will die. The lethal concentration is a lethal dose measurement used for gases or particulates. The LD may be based on the standard person concept, a theoretical individual that has perfectly \"normal\" characteristics, and thus not apply to all sub-populations.\n\n are not necessarily poisons, and vice versa. For example, food-industry wastewater—which may contain potato juice or milk—can be hazardous to the ecosystems of streams and rivers by consuming oxygen and causing eutrophication, but is nonhazardous to humans and not classified as a poison. Biologically speaking, any substance, if given in large enough amounts, is poisonous and can cause death. For instance, several kilograms worth of water would constitute a lethal dose. Many substances used as medications—such as fentanyl—have an only one order of magnitude greater than the ED50. An alternative classification distinguishes between lethal substances that provide a therapeutic value and those that do not.\n\n The term \"poison\" is often used colloquially to describe any harmful substance—particularly corrosive substances, carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens and harmful pollutants, and to exaggerate the dangers of chemicals. Paracelsus (1493–1541), the father of toxicology, once wrote: \"Everything is poison, there is poison in everything. Only the dose makes a thing not a poison\" (see median lethal dose). The term \"poison\" is also used in a figurative sense: \"His brother's presence poisoned the atmosphere at the party\". The law defines \"poison\" more strictly. Substances not legally required to carry the label \"poison\" can also cause a medical condition of poisoning. Some poisons are also toxins, which is any \n\nQuestion: who said the poison is in the dose\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is readily visible by light microscopy only in areas of thick skin, which are found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Located between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum layers, it is composed of three to five layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes. The keratinocytes of the stratum lucidum do not feature distinct boundaries and are filled with eleidin, an intermediate form of keratin. They are surrounded by an oily substance that is the result of the exocytosis of lamellar bodies accumulated while the keratinocytes are moving through the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum. The thickness of the stratum lucidum is controlled by the rate of mitosis (division) of the epidermal cells. Melanosomes in the stratum basale determine the darkness of the stratum lucidum.\n\n Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.\n\n Although the skin is a large and logical target for drug delivery, its basic functions limit its utility for this purpose. The skin functions mainly to protect the body from external penetration (by e.g. harmful substances and microorganisms) and to contain all body fluids. There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis. For transdermal delivery, drugs must pass through the two sublayers of the epidermis to reach the microcirculation of the dermis. The Stratum corneum is the top layer of the skin and varies in thickness from approximately ten to several hundred micrometres, depending on the region of the body. It is composed of layers of dead, flattened keratinocytes surrounded by a lipid matrix, which together act as \n\nScattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker.It serves many important functions, including regulating body temperature, maintaining water and electrolyte balance, and sensing painful and pleasant stimuli. The skin keeps vital chemicals and nutrients in the body while providing a barrier against dangerous substances from entering the body and provides a shield from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun. In addition, skin color, texture, and folds help mark people as individuals. Anything that interferes with skin function or causes changes in appearance can have important consequences for physical and mental health. Structure and Function\n\nThe skin has three layers—the epidermis, dermis, and fat layer (also called the subcutaneous layer). Each layer performs specific tasks. Epidermis: The epidermis is the relatively thin, tough, outer layer of the skin. Most of the cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes. They originate from cells in the deepest layer of the epidermis called the basal layer. New keratinocytes slowly migrate up toward the surface of the epidermis. Once the keratinocytes reach the skin surface, they are gradually shed and are replaced by younger cells pushed up from below. The outermost portion of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, is relatively waterproof and, when undamaged, prevents most bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis (along with other layers of the skin) also protects the internal organs, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels against trauma. In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.Getting Under the Skin\n\nThe skin has three layers.Beneath the surface of the skin are nerves, nerve endings, glands, hair follicles, and blood vessels.The epidermis also contains Langerhans' cells, which are part of the skin's immune system.Although these cells help detect foreign substances and defend the body against infection, they also play a role in the development of skin allergies.\n\nThe epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, consists of several distinct layers with different characteristics and functions. These layers include the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. In thick skin, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum is present between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum.\n\nThe stratum basale is the deepest layer of the epidermis, where new skin cells, called keratinocytes, are generated. These cells divide and move towards the surface of the skin as they mature. Keratinocytes play a crucial role in producing the protein keratin, which provides strength and structure to the skin.\n\nAbove the stratum basale is the layer called the stratum spinosum, which consists of keratinocytes with spinous processes on their surface. These processes form intercellular bridges with neighboring cells, contributing to the overall strength and integrity of the skin.\n\nThe next layer is the stratum granulosum, where keratinocytes contain granules called keratohyalin granules. These granules are involved in producing keratin and help to form a water barrier in the upper layers of the epidermis.\n\nOn the surface of the skin is the stratum corneum, which is composed of fully keratinized cells. These cells are flat and lack nuclei. The stratum corneum acts as a protective layer, preventing water loss and shielding the underlying layers of the skin from external factors.\n\nIn thick skin, such as the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum can be observed between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. Its function is to provide extra protection and thickness to these areas of the skin.\n\nIt's important to note that the epidermis also contains other cell types, including melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells. Melanocytes are responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin and protects it from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Langerhans' cells are involved in the immune response of the skin, helping to identify and capture foreign substances. Merkel's cells are specialized sensory cells that play a role in tactile sensation.\n\nIn summary, the different layers of the epidermis have distinct characteristics and functions. From the basal layer to the outermost layer, the epidermis consists of keratinocytes that produce keratin, form intercellular bridges, and provide a water barrier. The epidermis also contains other cell types like melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells, which contribute to the skin's color, immune response, and sensory perception.\n\nQuestion: the outer layer of the skin that contains no blood or nerve supply is the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After initial reluctance, the band recorded the song, and it was released as a single from the movie's soundtrack in 1996. The song became popular after The WB Television Network utilised the band's cover as the theme song for the witchcraft-themed television series Charmed. It was re-mixed for the show, with different instrumentation and vocals. The song went on to appear on Charmed: The Soundtrack (2003) and as a UK and Australian bonus track on Charmed: The Book of Shadows (2005). Both soundtrack albums charted well in the US, with both reaching the top ten on the Billboard Top Soundtracks chart. The song has since become a staple of '90s popular culture, and has been used in numerous media, including the movie trailer for Cruel Intentions, the film The Craft and the novel Eleanor & Park.\n\n \"Rehab\" is a song written and recorded by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, from her second and final studio album Back to Black (2006). Produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic. \"Rehab\" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US. \"Rehab\" became an international critical and commercial success, and has been referred to as Winehouse's signature song. It won three Grammy Awards at the 50th ceremony, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It also won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song. Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, and subsequent death, have contributed to the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a list of artists, such as Hot Chip, Lea Salonga, Seether, and the Jamaican mento band The Jolly Boys.\n\n Sevendust tried to pull \"Black\" off of the band's self-titled debut album before recording the song. Sevendust guitarist John Connolly said \"It was one of the first songs that we had done together as a band.

When new neighbors the Radfords, move in next door, they become suspicious of Cassie and her daughter. The dynamics of the series' focus would change during the six seasons, which later saw the Nightingales and Radfords become friendlier and more romantic, leading to Cassie's marrying for the second time, while at the same time shifted to stories involving its residents (including their relationships with others), an ongoing mystery, and a series of curses that tied to Cassie's lineage.\n\n The Good Witch premiered on the Hallmark Channel on January 19, 2008 and starred Catherine Bell as Cassandra \"Cassie\" Nightingale and Chris Potter as Chief of Police Jake Russell. The movie centers upon Cassie, a new arrival to the town of Middleton. She immediately catches the attention of the people around her, particularly Jake, who becomes enamored with her. Cassie also attracts negative attention from Martha Tinsdale, who believes that she is practicing black magic. The movie had great success on Hallmark Channel on the night of its premiere, making it the second-highest-rated original movie to that date. It premiered with a 3.8 HH (household) rating and was in nearly 3.2 million homes. It also was #1 in its time period, propelling the channel to the #4 spot in weekly ranking.\n\n angsty suburb), is the show you find your parents or grandparents watching when you come home for a visit.\" In 2019, the show was one of the network's most popular original series, and the Good Witch closed its season five in first place among household ratings on Sundays. The success of the series lifted the Hallmark Channel to be the highest-rated and most-watched cable network on the weekends. In July 2019, Deadline reported that Hallmark Channel renewed the series for a sixth season, and Bailee Madison would be leaving the show. Deadline wrote that \"Madison has been on Good Witch series since it launched in 2015, so her exit is bittersweet and emotional.\"\n\n In May 2017, the show placed second for four straight weeks, behind AMC’s Breaking Bad spin-off, Better Call Saul. In 2017, Mike Hale of The New York Times noted that the series has been \"ignored by critics and never nominated for an Emmy or a Golden Globe (or any other major television award in the United States).\" Hale continued to explain that the \"Good Witch, averaging more than 2.5 million viewers on Sunday nights on the Hallmark Channel, consistently beat more talked-about shows such as Fargo, The Americans, Silicon Valley, Veep, and Pretty Little Liars.\" Hale called the series \"a gentle, sentimental primetime fable set in an idealized Middle American small city (not \n\n Good Witch is a fantasy comedy-drama television series that is based on the television film series of the same name, produced by Whizbang Films in association with ITV Studios and the Hallmark Channel.

Historically, the execution of criminals and political opponents was used by nearly all societies—both to punish crime and to suppress political dissent. Among democratic countries around the world, all European (except Belarus) and Latin American states, many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and Timor Leste), and Canada have abolished capital punishment, while the majority of the United States, Guatemala, and most of the Caribbean as well as some democracies in Asia (e.g., Japan and India) and Africa (e.g., Botswana and Zambia) retain it. Among nondemocratic countries, \n\n such as John Radclive, Arthur Ellis and Camille Blanchard, hanged men at the Toronto Jail. The Toronto-based hangman Samuel Edwards, who worked during the Great Depression, carried out his first execution there in July 1931. Twenty-six men were hanged on the jail's indoor gallows. The jail saw three double hangings: Roy Hotrum and William McFadden in August 1921; Leonard Jackson and Steven Suchan in December 1952; Ronald Turpin and Arthur Lucas on 11 December 1962. Turpin and Lucas had each been convicted in separate murders, and their executions were Canada's last before capital punishment was abolished. In 2007, human remains were found on the jail's grounds during an archaeological assessment.\n\n of the offence. The maximum determinate sentence is a life sentence with a 25-year parole ineligibility period. For offences committed prior to 2 December 2011 all life sentences and related parole ineligibility periods are served concurrently (at the same time). In cases of multiple murder, where the offence occurred after 2 December 2011 (the date new legislation came into force), a court may, after considering any jury recommendation, order consecutive parole ineligibility periods for each murder. There are also options for an indeterminate sentence. There is no death penalty in Canada, making life imprisonment the most severe punishment to be imposed in the country.\n\n Before capital punishment was abolished in Canada, the Toronto Jail was the site of a number of hangings. Starting with the execution of John Boyd in January 1908, hangings at the jail took place in an indoor chamber, which was a converted washroom, at the northeast corner of the old building. Previously, condemned men had been hanged on an outdoor scaffold in the jail yard. The indoor facility was seen as an improvement because outdoor executions were quasi-public (at the hanging of Fred Lee Rice in 1905, crowds had lined surrounding rooftops to see something of the spectacle) and because the condemned didn't have to walk as far. The best-known Canadian \n\n In November 2007, Canada's minority Conservative government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government \"should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world\". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy. In a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, \"I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate.\"\n\nQuestion: when did canada get rid of the death penalty\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If such a concert were to take place, then Goodman would be the first jazz bandleader to perform at Carnegie Hall. \"Benny Goodman was initially hesitant about the concert, fearing for the worst; however, when his film Hollywood Hotel opened to rave reviews and giant lines, he threw himself into the work. He gave up several dates and insisted on holding rehearsals inside Carnegie Hall to familiarize the band with the lively acoustics.\" The concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938. It sold out weeks in advance, with the capacity 2,760 seats going for a top price of US$2.75 a seat.\n\n The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert by Benny Goodman, Columbia Records catalogue item SL-160, is a two-disc LP of swing and jazz music recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 16, 1938. First issued in 1950, the landmark recording captured the premiere performance given by a big band in the famed concert venue. The event has been described as \"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music.\" Both critical and public reception of the performances was outstanding. The title, mastered from preserved acetates, was among jazz's first double albums, first live recordings, and first to sell over a million copies. One of the earliest records of Benny Goodman music issued on the new long-playing format, the concert recording was also sold in a set of nine 45 rpm records in 1950 by Columbia. The subsequent discovery of the aluminum studio masters made from the original recording resulted in several high-quality CD reissues beginning in 1998.\n\nQuestion: who conducted the opening concert at carnegie hall\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The society embraced representatives of Left Chartists, German workers and craftsmen – members of the League of the Just – and revolutionary emigrants of other nationalities. During their stay in England in the summer of 1845, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels helped in preparing for the meeting but did not attend it as they had by then left London. Later they kept in constant touch with the Fraternal Democrats trying to influence the proletarian core of the society, which joined the Communist League in 1847, and through it the Chartist movement. The society ceased its activities in 1853.\n\n As part of the wider anti-war movement of the 1960s, student organisations such as the Harvard chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) ran anti-war activities on campus. In November 1966 for instance, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was prevented from leaving the campus by a group of about 800 students. Forced from his car, he was hoisted up on the hood of a convertible, where he agreed to answer questions from the crowd on the Vietnam War. A letter signed by 2,700 Harvard undergraduates apologising to McNamara was sent to him a few days after. A year later, in October 1967, a recruitment visit by Dow Chemicals, which supplied napalm to the military, was interrupted by protests. The Harvard Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs drew particular attention, with sit-ins disrupting their meetings. Although the faculty was willing to reduce the programs’ privileges, the Harvard Corporation refused to terminate it. These developments, alongside the creation of a degree program in Afro-American studies, led to the events of April 1969.\n\n In the fall of 1967, members of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (often referred to as \"MOBE\"), which was directed by David Dellinger, proposed a massive anti-war demonstration to coincide with the 1968 Democratic National Convention. In early 1968, the National Mobilization Committee opened a Chicago office directed by Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden, who were leading political organizers at the time and former leaders of Students for a Democratic Society. MOBE was an umbrella organization that included groups who were opposed to American participation in the Vietnam War. MOBE was run by a small executive board that set up a general framework for mass demonstrations, sent out invitations to the over 500 groups on its mailing lists, and coordinated \n\n As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Ross became engaged with political activism on behalf of progressive causes and emerged as a student leader. Inspired by the sit-in movement against racial segregation that began in February 1960. Ross became part of the early leadership of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Ross attended the first SDS convention in June 1960 and became a founder of the Ann Arbor chapter. He helped enlist Tom Hayden who became SDS President. At an SDS meeting held at Ann Arbor in 1961, a National Executive Committee (NEC) was elected with Ross as vice president. As a delegate at the 1962 annual convention, and a member of the \"drafting committee\", Ross participated in writing the Port Huron Statement, which was adopted as the SDS political manifesto. His reading of C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite shaped Ross' intellectual contributions to the document. His senior honors thesis examined the theoretical basis for Mill's work.\n\n Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was a national student activist organization in the United States during the 1960s, and was one of the principal representations of the New Left. Disdaining permanent leaders, hierarchical relationships and parliamentary procedure, the founders conceived of the organization as a broad exercise in \"participatory democracy\". From its launch in 1960 it grew rapidly in the course of the tumultuous decade with over 300 campus chapters and 30,000 supporters recorded nationwide by its last national convention in 1969. The organization splintered at that convention amidst rivalry between factions seeking to impose national leadership and direction, and disputing \"revolutionary\" positions on, among other issues, the Vietnam War and Black Power. A new national network for left-wing student organizing, also calling itself Students for a Democratic Society, was founded in 2006.\n\nQuestion: where did students for a democratic society start\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Mario Götze and Franck Ribéry scored for Bayern. Holger Badstuber left the match with a thigh injury. Bayern finished the matchday in second place. Then, on matchday four on 20 September, the match against Hamburger SV finished in a 0–0 draw. Guardiola decided to rotate players from their midweek Champions League match. Thomas Müller was on the substitutes bench, however, he replaced Arjen Robben in starting line-up after Robben was injured during the warm-up. Bayern finished the matchday in fourth place. On matchday five, on 23 September, Bayern defeated Paderborn 07 4–0 with two goals from Mario Götze and a goal each from Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller. Bayern finished the matchday in first place. On matchday six, on 27 September, Bayern defeated 1. FC Köln 2–0 with a goal from Mario Götze and an own goal from Daniel Halfar. Bayern were denied a penalty shot, again, after Arjen Robben went down. Xabi Alonso broke the record for having the most touches on the ball in a single match. Bayern finished the matchday in first place.\n\n was fouled by Mário Fernandes. The match had no supporters in the stadium because of racist behaviour of CSKA Moscow supporters. However, several Bayern supporters who made the trip to Moscow for the match saw the match from a skyscraper. This was the 100th win for Bayern in Champions League history. Bayern finished the matchday in first place. Then Bayern defeated Roma 7–1 on matchday three on 21 October. Bayern got two goals from Arjen Robben and a goal each from Mario Götze, Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Müller, Franck Ribéry, and Xherdan Shaqiri and Gervinho scored for Roma. Gervinho's goal ended Bayern's streak of 813 minutes without conceding a goal. The win was Bayern's biggest away \n\n After seeing two league championships heading to Dortmund and losing the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final to Chelsea at their own Allianz Arena, Bayern recovered to clinch the 2012–13 Bundesliga in record time, breaking Dortmund's points record which had been set the year before. At the end of that season, the rivals met in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final. The German clubs had eliminated the two Spanish contenders, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, leading to the term \"German Clasico\" term first being used at that time, based on the El Clásico between those two Spanish clubs. The game was also notable for the fact that Dortmund's Mario Götze had already agreed to join Bayern in the coming weeks (although he did not play in the final due to injury). In the first all-German European final, Arjen Robben scored a dramatic 89th-minute winner at Wembley. Bayern would wrap up the first Treble in their history a week later in the 2013 DFB-Pokal Final.\n\n This was the first time in the history of the Champions League (and European Cup) that the final was contested between two German sides. There were three previous Champions League finals between two clubs from the same country: 2000 (Spain), 2003 (Italy), and 2008 (England). It was Bayern Munich's 10th European Cup/Champions League final, third all-time behind Real Madrid (12) and A.C. Milan (11). They won four of those finals: in 1974, 1975, 1976, and most recently in 2001. The 2013 final was Bayern's third final in four years; they lost in both 2010 and 2012 (as the first team since 1984 to reach the Final held in their home stadium), adding to previous final losses in 1982, 1987, and 1999. For Dortmund, this was their second Champions League final, with them \n\n The 2013 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the 58th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 21st season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. The match took place on Saturday, 25 May 2013, at Wembley Stadium in London, England, between German Bundesliga clubs Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. In the first all-German Champions League final, Bayern won the match 2–1 with goals from Mario Mandžukić and man of the match Arjen Robben coming either side of an İlkay Gündoğan penalty for Dortmund. One week later, Bayern won the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal and, having already won the 2012–13 Bundesliga, completed the continental treble. As a result of their Champions League win, Bayern qualified to play against Chelsea, the winners of the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, in the 2013 UEFA Super Cup, and also earned the right to enter the semi-finals of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup as the UEFA representative.

The books revolve around the mysterious magic supplies store run by an old man named S.H. Elives. Each book follows a child who stumbles into the store and acquires a magical being or object of tremendous magical strength and abilities. The author Christopher Paolini has cited the book Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher as an inspiration for his Inheritance Cycle, as he \"began to wonder what kind of land a dragon would come from, who would find a dragon egg and who else would be looking for a dragon egg\", stating \"Trying to answer those three questions has resulted in over 1,000 pages in print\".\n\n and Witches, Fairies and Elves, Dwarfs, Spells and Bindings, and Giants and Ogres. A unique part of the series was that its books were written as stories, taking place from an \"in-universe\" perspective, presenting its subjects as real people, places, and things. Related to such things having once been real, a common thread through several of them was its documentation of the alleged decline of magical things from \"when the world was young\" to the modern day. The subjects—dragons, dwarfs, giants—are presented as being potent and strong at the dawn of time, but magical creatures grow weaker and eventually disappear as humans spread and demystify the world, though there \n\nIn the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles episode \"Princeton, February 1916\", Indiana Jones investigates the theft of Edison's plans for an electric car. Edison is portrayed by Richard K Olsen. ; The book \"Hey Kid, Want to Buy a Bridge?\" from The Time Warp Trio book series by Jon Scieszka, as well as the namesake episode from the companion television series, featured Edison as a character. ; The plot of Night of the New Magicians from the Magic Tree House book series by Mary Pope Osborne had the protagonists searching the 1889 World's Fair for four of the world's great visionaries including Edison. \n\n Amber House is the first book in what was initially dubbed the Amber House Trilogy by American author Kelly Moore and her daughters Tucker Reed and Larkin Reed. The book follows narrator Sarah Parsons, who discovers she has the psychic ability of psychometry, enabling her to see into her own history as she stays at her family's ancestral estate outside of Annapolis, Maryland. Amber House is a young adult paranormal mystery novel. Critics have remained in disagreement over what genre Amber House best fits into; Kirkus Reviews dubbed it \"horror romance,\" and Booklist cited the story's \"Gothic feel,\" while Publishers Weekly claimed the story \"straddles the lines between magical realism, fantasy, ghost stories, and horror, with a touch of romance and classic glamour.\" The authors categorize the book (and its sequels) as \"a time travel series.\"\n\n The Faraway Tree is a series of popular novels for children by British author Enid Blyton. The titles in the series are The Enchanted Wood  (1939), The Magic Faraway Tree (1943), The Folk of the Faraway Tree (1946) and Up the Faraway Tree (1951). The stories take place in an enchanted wood in which a gigantic magical tree grows – the eponymous 'Faraway Tree'. The tree is so tall that its topmost branches reach into the clouds and it is wide enough to contain small houses carved into its trunk. The wood and the tree are discovered by three children named Joe, Beth and Frannie who move into a house nearby.

After the recording was made, Bartholomew decided to overdub a string section from the New Orleans Symphony. Use of classical strings was unusual for early rock and roll. Domino was at first somewhat surprised when Bartholomew played back the new version with strings, but warmed to the distinctive sweet melancholy sound it added. The strings were arranged by Milton Bush, a trombonist who was the first-call string arranger at Cosimo's Studio. Bush wrote the arrangements standing up in 10 minutes while Domino looked on. He basically had the strings mimic the melody in the previous phrase. When finished, Domino asked Bush how much he wanted for the arrangement. Bush figured that $1 a minute was pretty good, so he charged Fats $10. The song went on to sell over two million copies.\n\n Domino was a hero of Charles. Domino had previously recorded the Charles tune \"Before I Grow Too Old\". When Domino stopped on tour in Lafayette, Louisiana, he invited Charles into his dressing room, and regretted he did not have a copy of his new record to give to Charles, but invited Charles to come visit him in Domino's home of New Orleans. Charles replied, \"I don't have a car. If I'd go, I'd have to walk.\" Afterwards, the thought remained on Charles's mind, and he said he wrote the song for Domino in some 15 minutes. After he got to New Orleans to accept Domino's invitation, Charles sang \"Walking to New Orleans\" for Domino. Domino was enthusiastic about the number and made a few modifications to it, including adding a quote from his earlier hit, \"Ain't That a Shame\". Dave Bartholomew made an orchestration for the backup \n\n of the City of New Orleans. However, since it did not connect with any other trains in either New Orleans or Chicago, Amtrak moved the route to an overnight schedule and brought back the Panama Limited name. However, it restored the City of New Orleans name in 1981, while retaining the overnight schedule. This was to capitalize on the popularity of a song about the train written by Steve Goodman and performed by Arlo Guthrie. Willie Nelson's recording of the song was #1 in 1984. Illinois Central ran several other trains along the main route including The Creole and The \n\n \"Walking to New Orleans\" is a 1960 song by Bobby Charles, written for and recorded by Fats Domino.

He is known for singing songs of protest against social injustice, and storytelling while performing songs, following the tradition of his father Woody Guthrie. Guthrie's best-known work is his debut piece, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree\", a satirical talking blues song about 18 minutes in length that has since become a Thanksgiving anthem. His only top-40 hit was a cover of Steve Goodman's \"City of New Orleans\". His song \"Massachusetts\" was named the official folk song of the state, in which he has lived most of his adult life. Guthrie has also made several acting appearances.

Drizzt defeats a group of bandits calling themselves Casin Cu Calas, a group that wears black and travels through the Orcish Kingdom of Many-Arrows and slays Orcs in their sleep.

After a fight with some of Aethelhelm's troops, Uhtred sends most of his followers, including Aethelstan, to Chester, while he and his daughter Stiorra go back to Gloucester to prevent Aethelred's daughter from being married to Eardwulf.

Sauron's northern army, which included many Easterlings, then attacked; Dale was overrun, and many Dwarves and Men took refuge in Erebor, which was promptly surrounded. Dáin was killed before the gates of Erebor defending the body of his fallen ally King Brand of Dale. Dáin's son Thorin III Stonehelm and King Bard II withstood the siege and routed Sauron's forces.\n\n Erebor became the home of the Folk of Durin, a clan of Dwarves known as the Longbeards, after they were driven from their ancestral home of Khazad-dûm. In the latter days of the Third Age, this Kingdom under the Mountain held one of the largest dwarvish treasure hoards in Middle-earth. Dale, a town of Men built between the two southern spurs of Erebor, grew in harmony with the dwarves. The Kingdom under the Mountain was founded by Thráin I the Old, who discovered the Arkenstone there. His son, Thorin I, left the mountain with much of the Folk of Durin to live in the Ered Mithrin (Grey Mountains) on account of the great riches to be found in that range. After dragons plundered their hoards, the Longbeards, led now by Thrór, a descendant of Thorin, returned to Erebor to take up the title King under the Mountain. Under Thrór's reign, Erebor became a great stronghold where the dwarves became numerous and prosperous, well known for the making of matchless weapons and armour.\n\n as recompense for the destruction. Thorin, mad with greed, refused all claims and sent word to his second cousin Dáin II Ironfoot, chief of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, who brought reinforcements to the aid of Thorin and Company. However before any battle began, an army of Orcs and Wargs descended on Erebor. Dwarves, Elves, and Men joined ranks against them, which led to the Battle of Five Armies. During this battle, Thorin's nephews Fíli and Kíli were killed, and Thorin himself was mortally injured; he died shortly afterwards. The title of King under the Mountain passed to Dáin.\n\nQuestion: who became king of erebor after thorin dies\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As a result of the Russian February Revolution in 1917, the Tsar abdicated and was replaced by a Russian Provisional Government. This helped overcome Wilson's reluctance to having the US fight alongside a country ruled by an absolutist monarch. Pleased by the Provisional Government's pro-war stance, the US accorded the new government diplomatic recognition on March 9, 1917. Congress declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917, but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various small co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers. Thus, the United States remained uninvolved in the military campaigns in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Pacific.\n\n The Western Front was one of the main theatres of war during the First World War. Following the outbreak of war in August 1914, the German Army opened the Western Front by invading Luxembourg and Belgium, then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France. The German advance was halted with the Battle of the Marne. Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918. Between 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front. The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed \n\n Kirchner's 'Self-Portrait as a Soldier' was painted in 1915, a year after the commencement of the First World War (WW1). The impetus for Germany's involvement in WW1 was its alliance with Austria-Hungary who declared war on Serbia on the 28th of July 1914, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The German invasion of Belgium in 1914 saw Britain declare war on Germany. The alliance system of WW1 pitted the Centrals Powers, encompassing Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria against the Allied Powers which compromised Russia, France, Great Britain and the United States.

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans, as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.

It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip. Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire).

Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a pH greater than 7 are bases. \"Clean\" or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. \n\n Interaction of and other  with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere can form acid rain which harms sensitive ecosystems such as lakes and forests. Elevated levels of can also harm vegetation, decreasing growth, and reduce crop yields.\n\n The combustion process of petroleum, coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example, acid rain can kill trees, and can kill fish by acidifying lakes. Coral reefs are also destroyed by acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece.\n\nThe major contributor to acid rain is not carbon monoxide. Acid rain is primarily caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These emissions come from various human activities such as burning fossil fuels in power plants, industrial processes, and vehicle exhaust. When SO2 and NOx react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere, they form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which can then fall to the ground as acid rain. These acids can have detrimental effects on ecosystems, causing harm to plants, animals, and aquatic life. It is important for industries and individuals to take measures to reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of acid rain.\n\nQuestion: rain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229) was part of the Catholic Church's efforts to crush the Cathars. It is linked to the movement now known as the Medieval Inquisition. Another example of a medieval heretic movement is the Hussite movement in the Czech lands in the early 15th century. The last person to be burned alive at the stake on orders from Rome was Giordano Bruno, executed in 1600 for a collection of heretical beliefs including Copernicanism, belief of an unlimited universe with innumerable inhabited worlds, opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and Incarnation.\n\n In Seville, in April 1562, the Inquisition made an auto-da-fé in which an effigy of him was burned. The works of Reina and his colleagues were placed in the Index of prohibited books and he was declared a \"heresiarch\" (leader of heretics). About 1563 Reina went on to Antwerp, where he became associated with the authors of the Polyglot Bible. In April 1564 he went to Frankfurt, where he settled with his family. Reina wrote the first great book against the Inquisition: Sanctae Inquisitionis hispanicae artes aliquot detectae, ac palam traductae (\"Some arts of Holy Inquisition\"). This work was printed in 1567 in Heidelberg under the pseudonym: Reginaldus Gonsalvius Montanus. He secretly translated the work of the critic of Calvin, Sebastian Castellion, De haereticis, an sint persequendi (\"Concerning heretics, whether they should be Persecuted\"), that condemned executions \"for reasons of conscience\" and documented the original Christian rejection of the practice.\n\n With the institution of the Roman Catholic Inquisition in Spain, and with the Dominican friar Tomás de Torquemada as the first Inquisitor General, the Catholic Monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity. Though Isabella opposed taking harsh measures against Jews on economic grounds, Torquemada was able to convince Ferdinand. On 31 March 1492, the Alhambra decree for the expulsion of the Jews was issued. The Jews had until the end of July, four months, to leave the country and they were not to take with them gold, silver, money, arms, or horses. Traditionally, it had been claimed that as many as 200,000 Jews left Spain, but recent historians have shown that such figures are exaggerated: Henry Kamen has shown that out of a total population of 80,000 Jews, a maximum of 40,000 left and the rest converted. Hundreds of those that remained came under the Inquisition's investigations into relapsed conversos (Marranos) and the Judaizers who had been abetting them.\n\n When Holy Office of the Inquisition had been established in New Spain in 1571, it exercised no jurisdiction over Indians, except for material printed in indigenous languages. Its first official Inquisitor was archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras, who established the \"Tribunal de la Fe\" (Tribunal of the Faith) in Mexico City. Through the Holy Office he transferred to Mexico the principles of the Inquisition set by Tomas Torquemada in Spain. However, the full force of the Inquisition would be felt on non-Indian populations, such as the \"Negro,\" \"mulatto,\" and even certain segments of European colonial population. Historian Luis González Obregón estimates that 51 death \n\n It was authorized by the Pope, yet the initial Inquisitors proved so severe that the Pope almost immediately opposed it to no avail. Early in 1483, the king and queen established a council, the Consejo de la Suprema y General Inquisición, to govern the inquisition and chose Torquemada to head it as inquisitor general. In October 1483, a papal bull conceded control to the crown. According to José Cassanova, the Spanish inquisition became the first truly national, unified and centralized state institution. After the 1400s, few Spanish inquisitors were from the religious orders. The Portuguese inquisition was also fully controlled by the crown which established a government board, known as the General Council, to oversee it.

Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. By comparison, about 5.9% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol consumption. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse.\n\nA survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. They are often due to traffic collisions and liver disease,   with homicide, suicide, and falls also contributing. Deaths related to alcohol among Native Americans are more common in men and among Northern Plains Indians. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births.\n\nNative American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Low self-esteem and transgenerational trauma have been associated with substance use disorders among Native American teens in the US and Canada. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution.\n\nHistorically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Therefore alcohol dependence was largely unknown when European contact was made. The use of alcohol as a trade item and the practice of intoxication for fun gradually undermined traditional Native American culture until by the late 18th century, alcoholism was recognized as a serious problem in many Native American communities. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Aboriginal use of alcohol generally took place in shared spiritual experiences that often arose out of the shamanistic tradition and was invested with expectations of improved well-being, as opposed to individual enjoyment or entertainment.\n\nBefore contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. [They related] the new phenomenon of intoxication ... to the old concepts of dreaming, communion with the spirit world, and the acquisition of power.\" Aberrant behavior while intoxicated was frequently forgiven (for example, among the Catawba and the Lakota Sioux) as though the drinker had been possessed by powers beyond his or her control.\n\nInfluence of Mesoamerica\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans in Mexico and Central America prepared over forty different alcoholic beverages from a variety of plants and plant extracts. Traditional Mayan beverages have included: \n Balché, made from the bark of Lonchocarpus violaceus soaked in honey and water and fermented.\n Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa).\n Coyol wine or chicha de coyol, made from the sap of coyol palms.\n Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear).\n Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples.\n Tesgüino and sotol made by the Huichol Indians from  Dasylirion wheeleri (commonly known as Desert Spoon or sotol), guavas, and corn stalks.\nTraditional drinks made from fermented corn or corn flour include tejuino, pozol, chicha or chicha de jora, and pox.\n\nCacao wine\nEvidence from Puerto Escondido dating to the formative stage of the Olmec Culture (1100-900 BC) indicates that a weak alcoholic beverage was made from fermented cacao pulp and stored in pottery containers. This is probably the earliest known consumption of cacao. Fermentation is an early step in the process later used to produce the nonalcoholic chocolate beverage widely consumed in Mesoamerica.\n\nPulque or octli\n\nFor at least 1,800 years the indigenous peoples of the Central Highlands of Mexico have brewed pulque (Nahuatl: ometochtli or octli) from the fermented sap of the maguey (agave) plant. Gas chromatographic analysis of ceramic vessels in Teotihuacan, dated to AD 200–550, found evidence that they once contained pulque. For the Aztecs, the imbibing of pulque was done only by certain people, under certain conditions. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Bernardino de Sahagún records the Aztec ceremony associated with drinking:\nLibation was done in this manner: when octli was drunk, when they tasted the new octli, when someone had just made octli ... he summoned people. He set it out in a vessel before the hearth, along with small cups for drinking. Before having anyone drink, he took up octli with a cup and then poured it before the hearth; he poured the octli in the four directions. And when he had poured the octli then everyone drank it.\n\nPulque was drunk by Aztec priests and their sacrificial victims, to increase the priests' enthusiasm and to ease the suffering of the victim. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Production of pulque was ritualized and the brewers would abstain from sex during the fermentation period. During most festivals, participants were not permitted to drink more than four cups of pulque, and Aztec folklore describes the likely fate of people who drank too much, including death by disease or accident. Exaggerated tales of the Huastec people characterized them as habitual drunkards and detailed their shameful behavior under the influence of alcohol, in an effort to discourage drunkenness among the Aztecs. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Drunkenness was also viewed as a means of establishing communication between humans and the gods, and was therefore not considered appropriate for commoners. Alcoholic intoxication was seen as an act of transcending the boundaries of human, divine and natural forces, one that should only be done by accomplished, brave and important members of society so as to avoid offending the supernatural world. Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices.\n\nPre-colonial North America\nPrior to contact with colonists, alcohol use and production were mainly concentrated in the southwestern United States. In 2007, archaeologist Glenna Dean conducted studies to show that, between AD 828 and 1126, Pueblos in Chaco Canyon were brewing a weak beer made by fermenting kernels of corn. Gas chromatography analysis of 800-year-old potsherds found at Pueblo Bonito in 2006 contained residues consistent with fermented corn products.\n\nSome Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The still, required to make stronger alcoholic beverages, was unknown. The Tohono O'odham, Piman, Apache, and Maricopa people all used the saguaro cactus to produce a wine, sometimes called tiswin or haren a pitahaya. The Chiricahua prepared a kind of corn beer called tula-pah using sprouted corn kernels, dried and ground, flavored with locoweed or lignum vitae roots, placed in water and allowed to ferment. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes.\n\nIn eastern North America the Creek of Georgia and Cherokee of the Carolinas used berries and other fruits to make alcoholic beverages, and there is some evidence that the Huron made a mild beer by soaking corn in water to produce a fermented gruel to be consumed at tribal feasts. In the northwest, the Kwakiutl of Vancouver Island produced a mildly alcoholic drink using elderberry juice, black chitons, and tobacco. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries.\n\nEuropean colonization\n A number of early accounts report that many Native Americans had no tradition of making alcoholic beverages, and did not know the effects of alcohol. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. They considered drunkenness \"degrading to free men\" and questioned the motives of those who would offer a substance that was so offensive to the senses and that made men foolish. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" Most drank alcohol only during social or trading contact with whites.\n\nWhen Europeans began making a large quantity of distilled spirits and wine available to Native Americans, the tribes had very little time to adapt and develop social, legal, or moral guidelines to regulate alcohol use. Early traders offered alcohol in trade, exchanging it for highly sought-after animal skins and other materials and resources. Traders also discovered that giving free alcohol to  Native Americans during trading sessions gave them a distinct advantage during negotiations. Extreme intoxication was common among the colonists, contrary to the inexperienced native populations.\n\nBy the early 1700s the effects of alcohol use disorder were damaging Native American communities. Rum as well as brandy and other distilled beverages had become important trade items and essential elements in diplomatic councils, treaty negotiations, and political transactions, and had become part of Native American gift-giving rituals. The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. Alcohol made men less reliable hunters and allies, destabilized village economics, and contributed to a rise in poverty. The minutes of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania for 16 May 1704 record a complaint submitted by Chief Ortiagh of the Conestoga Indians:\n\nGreat quantities of rum [are] continually brought to their town, insomuch as they [are] ruined by it, having nothing left but have laid out all, even their clothes, for rum, and may now, when threatened with war, be surprised by their enemies when beside themselves with drink, and so be utterly destroyed.\n\nJohn Lawson described the effects of alcohol on the tribes of North Carolina, which he observed during his travels there in 1700-1708:\n\nMost of the Savages are much addicted to Drunkenness, a Vice they never were acquainted with, till the Christians came amongst them. Some of them refrain drinking strong Liquors, but very few of that sort are found amongst them. Their chief Liquor is Rum, without any Mixture. This the English bring amongst them, and buy Skins, Furs, Slaves and other of their Commodities therewith. They never are contented with a little, but when once begun, they must make themselves quite drunk; otherwise they will never rest, but sell all they have in the World, rather than not have their full Dose. In these drunken Frolicks, (which are always carried on in the Night) they sometimes murder one another, fall into the Fire, fall down Precipices, and break their Necks, with several other Misfortunes which this drinking of Rum brings upon them; and tho' they are sensible of it, yet they have no Power to refrain this Enemy. About five years ago, when Landgrave Daniel was Governor, he summon'd in all the Indian Kings and Rulers to meet, and in a full Meeting of the Government and Council, with those Indians, they agreed upon a firm Peace, and the Indian Rulers desired no Rum might be sold to them, which was granted, and a Law made, that inflicted a Penalty on those that sold Rum to the Heathens; but it was never strictly observ'd, and besides, the young Indians were so disgusted at that Article, that they threatened to kill the Indians that made it, unless it was laid aside, and they might have Rum sold them, when they went to the Englishmen's Houses to buy it.\n\nEuropean-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" In 1753, Benjamin Franklin witnessed a drunken brawl in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, after providing rum to a party of Iroquois in exchange for their cooperation during treaty discussions, and wrote in his autobiography:\n\n[They] are extremely apt to get drunk, and when so are very quarrelsome & disorderly ... indeed if it be the Design of Providence to extirpate these Savages in order to make room for Cultivators of the Earth, it seems not improbable that Rum may be the appointed Means. It has already annihilated all the Tribes who formerly inhabited the Sea-coast.\n\nAt the same treaty conference, the Oneida leader Scarouady complained:\nYour Traders now bring scarce any Thing but Rum and Flour. ... The Rum ruins us. We beg you would prevent its coming in such Quantities, by regulating the Traders ... We desire it may be forbidden, and none sold in the Indian Country. ... When these Whiskey Traders come, they bring thirty or forty Cags, and put them down before us, and make us drink; and get all the Skins that should go to pay the Debts we have contracted for Goods bought of the Fair Traders; and by this Means, we not only ruin ourselves, but them too. These wicked Whiskey Sellers, when they have once got the Indians in Liquor, make them sell their very Clothes from their Backs. In short, if this Practice be continued, we must be inevitably ruined: We most earnestly therefore beseech you to remedy it.\n\nIn 1773 the missionary David Zeisberger was preaching in Shawnee communities in Ohio when he encountered Chief Gischenatsi, who told the missionary that the sale of alcohol was a deliberate attempt to undermine indigenous culture: \nAs the white people understand the weakness and incapacity of the Indians, they have a certain power over us, while pretending that, with all their deception, they mean well by the Indians. They come and bring rum into our towns, offer it to the Indians and say, drink; this they will do until they become quite beside themselves and act as though they were out of their heads. [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. But who makes them so foolish, who is at fault?Zeisberger, David. \"The Diaries of David Zeisberger Relating to the First Missions in the Ohio Basin.\" Ed. Archer Butler Hulbert and William Nathaniel Schwarze. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921.\n\nIn his research for the Genocide Convention, Raphael Lemkin proposed that distribution of alcohol was one of several tools (such as forced relocations, destruction of cultural symbols, and \"re-education\" of children) by which European-American colonists committed cultural genocide in North America. Lemkin theorized that the availability of alcohol undermined social integrity, promoted violence, impeded organized resistance, and contributed to the belief that Native Americans were culturally inferior. Lemkin argued that once a people becomes dependent on alcohol \"the desire for cheap individual pleasure [would] be substituted for the desire for collective feelings and ideals based on a higher morality.\"\n\nThe effects of Indian removal and relocation\n\nFollowing the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, large numbers of Native Americans were forcibly relocated to designated lands west of the Mississippi River. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. In this environment of an already-disrupted, fragmented society, the demand for alcohol was high, and white businessmen quickly discovered that bison hunters would trade hides for alcohol at a fraction of their commercial value. Hundreds of new businesses were established to take advantage of the growing market for buffalo hide, used for machinery belts, army boots, robes and rugs. On his wagon trip from the Arkansas to the South Platte in the winter of 1839–1840, Indian trader James Beckwourth bartered twenty gallons of whiskey for sixteen horses and over two hundred buffalo robes from the Indians. Beckwourth reported that \"one pint of alcohol, costing no more than six cents [in Missouri], was [diluted] into five times the quantity of whiskey, usually one pint for one buffalo robe,\" which would sell for more than ten dollars in St. Louis. By 1841, businessman William Bent was shipping over 27,000 buffalo hides annually to St. Louis, most of them traded from Cheyenne, Arapahoe and Kiowa hunters in exchange for whiskey. To evade federal laws prohibiting whites from selling alcohol to Indians, many traders (including  Bent) married Native American women and were formally inducted into their tribes.\n\nDuring subsequent years alcohol further destabilized Native American communities. Indian Agent Richard Cummins at Fort Leavenworth wrote: \"it is ardent spirits that causes many of them to steal one from another, to kill one another in combats when drunk, [and] to neglect all kinds of business.\" By the 1850s, tribal populations entered into a steep decline: in 1857 the Kansa numbered 1,237, and by 1862 there were only 802. By 1872 tribal population was down to 700, with no males over the age of fifty-five. Other tribes shrank at a similar rate. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves.\n\nThe Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma.\n\nLegislation controlling access to alcohol\n\nBy the early eighteenth century it had become clear that alcohol was harming Native American society and health. A series of local regulations were passed beginning as early as October 1701, when the Pennsylvania Assembly prohibited the sale of rum to the Indians, however as the law was poorly enforced and the penalty was light—a fine of ten pounds and confiscation of any illegal supplies—rum continued to be used to barter for furs. In 1745, partly due to the complaints of Shawnee chief Peter Chartier, the fine was doubled and the Shawnees were authorized to destroy any supplies of rum brought illegally into their communities. In 1767, regulations adopted at the Augusta Conference in the Province of Georgia attempted to limit the amount of alcohol brought into Native American communities to no more than fifteen gallons of rum, although this referred mainly to the Creek, Cherokee and Catawba Indians.\n\nThe Indian Nonintercourse Act\nOn 30 March 1802, federal action was taken to restrict the transport of alcohol into indigenous communities, when Congress (at the urging of Chief Little Turtle) passed the revised Indian Nonintercourse Act authorizing the president \"to take such measures, from time to time, as to him may appear expedient to prevent or restrain the vending or distributing of spirituous liquors among all or any Indian tribes.\" But beyond giving the President responsibility for monitoring alcohol sold to Native Americans, the law made little difference to the expanding commercial sales of rum and whiskey along the frontier. No other conclusive action was taken until 1832, when the Office of Commissioner of Indian Affairs was created, primarily to settle land disputes, but also to restrict the sale of alcohol on Indian lands: \"No ardent spirits shall be hereafter introduced, under any pretense, into the Indian country,\" stated the act which created this office.\n\nRecognizing that penalties and exceptions needed to be written into law, Congress passed 25 U.S.C. § 177, \"Act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers\" on 30 June 1834, superseding the old Nonintercourse Act of 1802 and imposing a fine of $500 for anyone who \"shall sell, exchange, or give, barter, or dispose of, any spirituous liquor or wine to an Indian, (in Indian country).\" The law provided exceptions for alcohol intended for US government troops, and stipulated that any supplies of illegal alcohol could be confiscated and destroyed. An additional provision in the law mandated a \"$1,000 fine for setting up and operating a distillery in Indian Country for manufacturing ardent spirits,\" to prevent entrepreneurs from making alcohol rather than importing it. Immediate results were encouraging: by 1835 the first Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Elbert Herring, declared, \"The exclusion of ardent spirits, where it could be effected, has done much good.\" This act was amended multiple times but remained in force until 1953.\n\nProhibition on Indian land\n\nAn 1847 amendment introduced prison terms for those convicted of selling or attempting to sell alcohol \"in Indian country.\" It also prohibited the distribution of goods or annuities to Indians under the influence of liquor, or when there was ready access to liquor. Goods and annuities could not be distributed until chiefs \"have pledged themselves to use all their influence, and to make all proper exertions, to prevent the introduction and sale of such liquor in their country.\" The problem with this law was that it did not prevent the sale of alcohol to Native Americans, but only that which occurred on Indian land. Alcohol could still be legally purchased in white communities by Native Americans, and taken home. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\"\n\nOn 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. Indians refused to testify against whites who sold them alcohol and juries were reluctant to convict businessmen, who were often reputable members of the community, based on the testimony of an Indian, usually a known alcoholic. Judges frequently imposed less than the maximum penalty on convicted offenders, sometimes ordering fines of $1 and prison terms of one day. In at least one case, the defendant was acquitted by a lenient judge even after pleading guilty.\n\nIn 1876 the US Supreme Court recommended that Congress take action to restrict the sale of alcohol near reservations. In United States v. Forty-Three Gallons of Whiskey, Associate Justice David Davis wrote the opinion of the court that\nIf liquor is injurious to them inside of a reservation, it is equally so outside of it; and why cannot Congress forbid its introduction into a place near by, which they would be likely to frequent? It is easy to see that the love of liquor would tempt them to stray beyond their borders to obtain it; and that bad white men, knowing this, would carry on the traffic in adjoining localities.\n\nSuch action has been taken locally in several states, including in 2017 when the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission voted to deny license renewals to the four liquor stores in Whiteclay, Nebraska, on the edge of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\n\nThe problem of beer\n\nIn 1892 the United States District Court for the District of Montana found that beer was not included in the law's specification that \"spirituous liquors\" (which had included wine since 1834) were not to be sold or given to Indians. The result was a sudden introduction of beer saloons into reservations across the west. The agent in Muskegee, Indian Territory (Arkansas), reported \"the opening of beer saloons in every village in the agency, almost without exception. The Indian and Federal laws were openly, flagrantly, and defiantly violated, drunkenness and its train of evils held full sway.\" Patent medicines such as Jamaica ginger and cooking flavors such as lemon extract containing a high alcohol content were also being sold in large quantities on reservations. The 1893 amendment to the law prohibited \"ardent spirits, ale, beer, wine or intoxicating liquors or liquors of whatever kind,\" punishable with imprisonment for not more than two years and fines of not more than $300 for each offense. An 1897 amendment to the Indian Appropriations Act (29 Stat. at L. 506, chap. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\"\n\nThe Heff decision\nIn 1905 the US Supreme Court overturned the 1904 conviction in Kansas of Albert Heff, who was convicted of selling two quarts of beer to an Indian, and was fined $200 and sentenced to four months in jail. The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. Lewis St. John, writing about the tribes of Washington State, says: The year following the Heff decision saw an increase of the liquor traffic among the Indians of Puget Sound undreamed-of before. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Other agencies report a similar striking increase in the amount of drunkenness, crime, and death and a marked lowering of moral standards and civilization. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship.\n\nRepeal of discriminatory legislation\nBy this time, the Temperance movement in the United States had gained widespread support and National Prohibition was enacted in 1919 with the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Veterans of World War II, who were able to obtain liquor with no difficulty while in the armed forces, have made many protests against the existence of the law. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" During the next seven years Congress engaged in a heated debate over the dangers and benefits of repealing the \"Indian liquor laws.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians.\n\nWithin a few years, most tribes passed their own prohibition laws, but they were adopted by Indians for Indians, not imposed on them by the federal government. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. In Alaska, liquor sales have been regulated by individual communities since 1986 as long as they conform to state laws.\n\nIt is now largely recognized that prohibition has been unsuccessful. As of 2007, 63 percent of the federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states had legalized alcohol sales on their reservations. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Legalizing sales enables the tribes to keep more money within their reservation economies and support new businesses and services, as well as to directly regulate, police and control alcohol sales. The retained revenues also provide funds for health care services and facilities to treat alcohol use disorder. In some cases, legalization of alcohol sales has also supported the development of resorts and casinos, to generate revenues for other economic enterprises.\n\nNative American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Initially, activists such as Peter Chartier, King Hagler and Little Turtle resisted the use of rum and brandy as trade items, in an effort to protect Native Americans from cultural changes they viewed as destructive. Later activists (William Apess and Samson Occom) framed temperance in terms of Christianity, conforming to a broader temperance movement in the United States. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nPatterns\nThe 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III) found that 19.2% of Native Americans surveyed had had an alcohol use disorder during the previous twelve months, and 43.4% had had an alcohol use disorder at some time during their lives (compared to 14.0% and 32.6% of whites, respectively). This contrasts sharply with the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which surveyed adolescents and adults receiving treatment and found that 9.7% of Native Americans surveyed had had an alcohol use disorder during the previous twelve months (compared to 6.1% of whites). An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\"\n\nGender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. Within Lakota society there are few social controls on alcohol misuse, nor is there pressure to stay sober. Drunken behavior is excusable, and the family does not ostracize people with an alcohol use disorder but often provides them with shelter and food. She notes that there is constant peer pressure among men to join others in drinking as a social activity. Quitting alcohol then becomes a personal endeavor that requires substantial will power, introspection and sacrifice. Modern therapies attempt to connect treatment to traditional rituals emphasizing the individual's search for spiritual strength and guidance, such as the sun dance or vision quest.\n\nA 2002 study looked at alcohol dependence and treatment in 172 Native American and Alaskan Native women who were in treatment at nine substance use disorder treatment centers in the west, southwest, northern plains, the midwestern US and Alaska. As part of the study, participants' records were examined to confirm self-reported information. Fifty-two staff members employed at the treatment centers were also interviewed. Among the participants, 81% had been emotionally, physically and/or sexually abused as children and 78% had been abused as adults. Over half had been abandoned by one or both parents, raised by relatives, sent to a boarding school, or had run away from home as a child. Seventy-two percent had been arrested at least once for an alcohol-related reason. The mean age of first alcohol use was 14, with some participants reporting first use as young as age 6. Many of the participants had been introduced to alcohol by a parent or an older sibling. Close to 100% of the study participants described using alcohol to suppress grief, self-pity and loneliness. Most of the women said that the death of a close family member, a divorce, or the end of an important relationship motivated them to drink regularly and heavily. Seventy-three percent reported drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe leading obstacles preventing women from starting treatment were lack of child care and lack of affordable transportation. This was especially true for women living in isolated rural areas, but also pertained to women in cities with inadequate public transportation systems. Women also had to contend with resistance from partners who did not want them to start treatment. Many women cited confidentiality concerns as a reason for delaying treatment.\n\nA primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Forty percent entered treatment due to a court order to avoid incarceration because of repeated criminal offenses such as driving while intoxicated. Twenty percent of participants were referred by a medical professional, sometimes because of pregnancy, with pressure or encouragement from family or friends as an important secondary motivation.\n\nTribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. This may be related to differing social tolerance of aberrant behavior when intoxicated, and certainly the socioeconomic conditions of different Native American communities play a role in alcohol misuse. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. A 2003 study found that lifetime rates of alcohol dependence varied from 21 to 56 percent for men and 17 to 30 percent for women across seven geographically diverse American Indian tribes.\n\nBeals et al. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992. They found that alcohol dependence was more common in the Northern Plains sample (13.0%) than in the Southwest sample (12.2%), and both were higher than in the US sample (10.7%). Northern Plains women had a rate of alcohol dependence more than twice that of either US or Southwest women. The authors speculate that \"Southwest women, as the carriers of tradition in this matrilineal culture, may have greater ties to their Native ways and thus be at less risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.\" Of those individuals in the Native American samples who sought professional help for a substance use disorder, 26.3% of the Southwest Indians went to a traditional or spiritual healer as compared to only 17.4% of those in Northern Plains sample.\n\nPhillip A. May's in-depth examination of the epidemiology of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence among Native Americans (1994) found that tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize had fewer alcohol-related problems. Tribes in which social interactions and family structure were disrupted by modernization and acculturative stress (i.e., young people leaving the community to find work) had higher rates of alcohol use and misuse. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol. May draws parallels to other societies affected by cultural change. Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress.\n\nStudies on drinking behavior among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache suggest that binge drinking occurs more commonly in communities that are more culturally distinct from white mainstream culture, as measured by education level, employment, and engagement in religious activities, and that alcohol is typically consumed intensively in intermittent, public social gatherings that attract the attention of law enforcement. The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. A comparison of the Navajo drinking patterns in 1969 with patterns of the same individuals in 1994 showed a transition towards solitary, daily drinking, although many Navajos quit drinking as they reached middle age, citing health concerns and religious beliefs.\n\nUnderage drinking\nSurveys have shown that Native American youth are more likely to start drinking at a younger age, more likely to drink heavily, and more likely to suffer negative consequences of drinking than their non-Native counterparts. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population.\n\nPsychosocial stressors play a significant role in alcohol use among Native adolescents. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court.\n\nNative American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. Other youth exhibit an experimental pattern of drinking through adolescence and this is noted as one of the biggest identifiers of binge drinking later in life.\n\nBinge drinking\n\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAAA, defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to 0.08 g/dL. This typically occurs after 4 drinks for women and 5 drinks for men, in about 2 hours. However, as Silk-Walker et al. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Binge drinking has less impact on health if enough time elapses between binges, however binge drinkers have a higher risk of death by accident, violence or alcohol poisoning as they are less accustomed to intoxication.\n\nAnastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment.\n\nPhilip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%).\n\nA 2006 study found that 29.6% of Native Americans reported regular binge drinking as compared to 25.9% of whites, 25.6% of Hispanics and 21.4% of African-Americans. The 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which surveyed adolescents and adults receiving treatment, found that 3.0% of Native Americans aged 12 to 17 reported binge drinking during the previous twelve months (compared to 6.6% of whites). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016.\n\nAt least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively.\n\nContributing factors\n\nGenetic predisposition to alcoholism\nThe incidence of alcohol use disorder varies with gender, age, and tribal culture and history. While little detailed genetic research has been done, it has been shown that alcoholism tends to run in families with possible involvement of differences in alcohol metabolism and the genotype of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. Many scientists have provided evidence of the genetic component of alcoholism by the biopsychosocial model of alcoholism, but the molecular genetics research currently has not found one specific gene that is responsible for the rates of alcoholism among Native Americans, implying the phenomenon may be due to an interplay of multiple genes and environmental factors. Research on alcoholism in family systems suggests that learned behavior augments genetic factors in increasing the probability that children of alcoholics will themselves have problems with alcohol.\n\nFirewater myths\nAfter European contact, white drunkenness was often interpreted by other whites as the misbehavior of an individual. Native drunkenness was interpreted in terms of the inferiority of a race. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol.\n American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\").\nAmerican Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol.\n American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated.\n These very traits produced immediate, devastating effects when alcohol was introduced to Native tribes via European contact.\n The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities.\n\nDon Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. The scientific literature has refuted the claims to many of these myths by documenting the wide variability of alcohol problems across and within Native tribes and the very different response that certain individuals have to alcohol as opposed to others. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism.\n\nBelief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Such beliefs can also prevent young people from seeking treatment for alcoholism due to a lack of confidence in their own ability to recover.\n\nHistorical trauma response\nHistorical trauma is psychological trauma resulting from physically and emotionally harmful or threatening experiences shared by a group over the lifespan and across generations. Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart has argued that historical trauma plays a significant role in motivating substance misuse as a pathological coping strategy to deal with \"low self-esteem, loss of cultural identity, lack of positive role models, history of abuse and neglect, self-medication due to feelings of hopelessness, and loss of family and tribal connections.\" Brave Heart has argued that there is a significant correlation between alcohol misuse, depression and suicide and the emotional responses to historical trauma such as disenfranchised grief and internalized oppression. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma.\n\nTraumatic experiences and PTSD\nSeveral studies have found higher-than-average rates of PTSD among Native Americans. At least one study found the prevalence of PTSD was as high as 21.9%. This rate is comparable to rates for groups experiencing severe and extreme events, such as mass shootings, major burns, and combat. Statistically, the incidence of alcohol misuse among survivors of trauma is significantly elevated, and survivors of physical, emotional and sexual abuse in childhood have among the highest rates of alcohol misuse.\n\nConsequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense.\n\nCertain risk factors have a high correlation with levels of domestic violence, including the offender and victim both being under the age of 40, presence of a substance use disorder, receiving public assistance, and the offender and/or the victim witnessing domestic violence between their parents as a child. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse.\n\nAlcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nDisease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. The median alcohol-attributed death rate for Native Americans (60.6 per 100,000) was twice as high as the rate for any other racial or ethnic group. Males are affected disproportionately more by alcohol-related conditions than females. The highest risk of alcohol-related deaths is between 45 and 64 years of age. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are 3.9 times as prevalent in the Native American population than the general US population. Of all alcohol-attributable deaths, motor vehicle accidents account for 27.5% and alcoholic liver disease accounts for 25.2%. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities.\n\nAlcohol was shown to be a factor in 69% of all suicides of Native Americans between 1980 and 1998. From 2003 to 2014, Native American suicide rates in the 18 states participating in the National Violent Death Reporting System were 21.5 per 100,000, more than 3.5 times higher than among other ethnicities in the US. Compared with whites, successful Native American suicides had 2.1 times the odds of a positive alcohol toxicology result and 1.8 times the odds of having had a reported alcohol abuse problem prior to suicide.\n\nFetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)\nNative Americans have one of the highest rates of fetal alcohol syndrome recorded for any specific racial or ethnic subgroup in the US. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1981 to 1991, the prevalence of FAS in the overall U.S. population per 10,000 births was 2.1. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births.\n\nProtective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. High concentrations of thiamine found in beans may prevent alcohol-induced Beri-beri. Soaking maize in alkaline \"limewater,\" as in the traditional preparation of corn tortillas, frees niacin and folate for human biological use, (a process known as Nixtamalization) thus preventing  alcohol-induced pellagra and macrocytic anemia.\n\nAlcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. \n the psychosocial model, which assumes that drinking is a maladaptive response to psychological trauma, social pressures and family dynamics, and that it can be managed 1) by educating the drinker to use other behavior patterns to cope with stress, and 2) by developing strong peer support and social support networks. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous.\n the assimilative model, in which standard treatments are employed in a Native American setting operated by Native American practitioners.\n the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes.\n the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach.\n\nTreatment for alcohol dependence usually relies on a combination of:\n Alcohol detoxification and medically managed withdrawal from the physical dependence induced by chronic alcohol misuse, usually implemented during a brief hospital stay.\n Partial hospitalization where the patient continues to reside at home, but commutes to a treatment center up to seven days a week. \n Residential treatment, either long-term (6–12 months) or short-term (3–6 weeks), commonly referred to as rehabilitation.\n Outpatient treatment programs, including Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs).\n Individualized counseling\n Group counseling\n\nSAMHSA's Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy\nThe Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy (OTAP) serves as primary point of contact between the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and tribal governments, tribal organizations, and federal agencies on behavioral health issues that impact tribal communities. OTAP supports SAMHSA's efforts to implement the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) of 2010 and the National Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda. The Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (OIASA), an organizational component of OTAP, coordinates federal partners and provides tribes with technical assistance and resources to develop and enhance prevention and treatment programs for substance use disorders, including alcohol.\n\nIndian Health Services\nThe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. It addresses and treats alcoholism from a disease model perspective.\n\nTribal Action Plan\nThe Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1986 was updated in 2010 to make requirements that the Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (OIASA), a subdivision of SAMHSA, is to work with federal agencies to assist Native American communities in developing a Tribal Action Plan (TAP). The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance use disorders among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA.\n\nOrganizations\n National Indian Health Board: Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda\n Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTC) funded by the Indian Health Service, provide clinical evaluation, substance use disorder education, psychotherapy, art therapy, adventure-based counseling, life skills, medication management, evidence-based treatment, aftercare relapse prevention, and post-treatment follow-up services.\n Native American Connections: Behavioral Health Services\n White Bison Recovery Resources\n Native American Indian General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous\n American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Substance Abuse, as of 2017, was over 4 decades old and was included in the 2-volume Encyclopedia of American Indian Issues Today, published 2013.\n SAMHSA's Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center provides Native American communities with tools for preventing mental illness, substance use disorders and suicide.\n Native American Health Center's focus is the San Francisco Bay Area.\nNative American Indian Alcoholics Anonymous\n The Wellbriety Movement is an interconnected web carrying the message of cultural knowledge about recovery for individuals, families, and communities.\n One Sky Center, a National Resource Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Health, Education and Research dedicated to quality health care across Indian Country.\n Indian Country Child Trauma Center (ICCTC) develops trauma-related treatment protocols, outreach materials, and service delivery guidelines specifically designed for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children and their families. \n First Nations Behavioral Health Association\n Society of TRUTH (Tribal Families, Rural and Urban, Together Healing), a coalition of American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations providing information and resources to support indigenous ways of life, healing and wellness.\n The National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH), a national organization devoted to the support and development of quality, accessible, and culturally-competent health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) living in urban settings.\n\nIssues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Therapy can be an opportunity for Native Americans to reaffirm their cultural heritage.\n\nAlcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Coyhis and White make five recommendations in regard to the treatment of Native Americans for alcohol problems:\n\n In order to create a firm and effective relationship between the treatment agency and the tribal community, counselors and clinicians should understand the cultural and historical context that has provoked alcohol misuse, and be familiar with the organization, histories, values, ceremonies and cultures of Native Americans with whom they work. Counselors should be aware of the enormous diversity in personal experiences, personalities, spiritual beliefs, and acculturation, as well as the differing patterns of alcohol misuse and the multiple treatment modalities available.\n Counselors should take the time to master the cultural etiquette appropriate for each client in terms of verbal communication (greetings, humor, establishing rapport) and non-verbal signals (eye contact, touch, paralanguage, boundaries of personal space). Such etiquette varies between and within tribes.\n Family and community play an essential role in any individual's motivation to stay in recovery. Family members, tribal elders, and traditional healers should be encouraged to participate in designing and delivering treatment. Transgenerational trauma can be a significant factor in young people's substance use disorder patterns.\n Treatment can be made more effective by combining Native and Western healing practices. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance. Treatments should make clear reference to traditional Native values such as patience, generosity, cooperation, and humility, and to teaching metaphors like the medicine wheel. Therapeutic activities may make use of symbols including the sacred pipe and eagle feathers, rituals such as the sweat lodge, drum circles or smudging ceremonies, and to traditional arts like woodcarving, beadwork and silversmithing. Traditional Native legends can be used as a framework for therapeutic storytelling.\n Alcohol treatment and recovery services should focus on broader goals related to Native communities rather than limiting themselves to individual therapy. Throughout history, religious and cultural revitalization movements have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of alcohol on Native communities. Addiction treatment agencies and counselors can become actively involved in communities by emphasizing the connection between personal health and community health, so as to build a culture of abstinence, healthy substitution, or conscientious moderation.\n\nAlcohol education and prevention programs\nA variety of substance use disorder prevention efforts, both face-to-face and web-based, have been implemented to build self-esteem and combat alcoholism among Native American and Native Alaskan youth. Researchers have found that standard substance misuse prevention programs are less effective among Native Americans because of the poor understanding of the unique historical and sociopolitical context of each tribe. One program used motivational interviewing with Native American adolescents aged 14 to 18 living in urban communities in California. Focus groups were designed to help participants explore and resolve their ambivalence about drug and alcohol use. A systematic review of programs in which both students and parents participated revealed that restrictive disciplinary measures used by parents often have a counterproductive effect, and that drug and alcohol use by family members was a stronger influence on early use by adolescents than such behavior among non-family peers. The use of a Native American Talking Circle Intervention among Cherokee adolescents in an Oklahoma school promoted self-efficacy and reduced substance misuse by 45% over the course of 8.5 weeks.\n\nFrom January 1994 until May 31, 2002 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the Healthy Nations Initiative to help Native Americans reduce the demand for and use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Healthy Nations provided funds for public education, substance misuse treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and supporting services for 14 Native American tribes, incorporating traditional Native American cultural values to encourage youth to avoid drinking, drug use and smoking.\n\nPrevention programs have used innovative strategies to promote healthy substitution and alternatives to drinking in Native American communities. With the help of Bernie Whitebear, the Seattle Indian Health Board developed technology-focused youth mentoring projects in partnership with the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma actively engaged up to 1,000 members in increasing physical activity and healthy lifestyles, initiating cultural heritage projects and a school-based health promotion curriculum which included alcohol education. Norton Sound Health Corporation, based in Nome, Alaska, instituted a Village-Based Counselor program to provide much-needed behavioral health services to its more remote villages. Lechner et al. have analyzed the responses to psychological and historical trauma among Native American youth and developed a series of interventions, including life skills development, suicide prevention training, talking circle paradigms, and \"Healing the Canoe,\" a substance abuse prevention program based on promoting a sense of belonging and cultural identity.\n\nSee also\n\nAlcohol in New France\nContemporary Native American issues in the United States \nIndian rolling\nMethamphetamine and Native Americans\nMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Utah\nModern social statistics of Native Americans\nNative American health\nNavajo reservations and domestic abuse\nNew World Syndrome\nPeter Chartier\nReservation poverty\nWhiteclay, Nebraska\n\nReferences\n\nAlcohol abuse in the United States\nAlcohol in the United States\nNative American topics\nNative American health\nAmerican Indian reservations\nNative American history\nAlcoholic drinks\n\n long-standing support of November being proclaimed annually as Native American Heritage Month.\" Chapman said Fallin's veto of a nonpartisan bill \"defied logic\" and was a slap in the face to Native Americans in Oklahoma to deny them a day to commemorate their unique history. In 2019, the Philadelphia Inquirer interviewed Chapman for a Memorial Day article about 2nd Lt. Benjamin Hodgson, an officer with the 7th Cavalry buried in Philadelphia. Hodgson died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn alongside George Armstrong Custer in 1876. Chapman was asked whether Americans should honor soldiers who fought not in defense of country, but to dispossess native peoples of their land and their lives. Chapman responded, \n\n The day came about after a series of calls for such a celebration. It was first self-declared Indian Day in 1945, by Jules Sioui and chiefs from across Turtle Island (North America). In 1982, the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations) called for the creation of a National Aboriginal Solidarity Day to be celebrated on 21 June. Slightly more than a decade later in 1995, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended that a National First Peoples Day be designated. Also in that same year, a national conference of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people chaired by Elijah Harper, titled The Sacred Assembly, called for a national holiday to celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada. 21 June often coincides with the summer solstice. National Indigenous Peoples Day is now the first of a series of Celebrate Canada days, followed by the National Holiday of Quebec on \n\n States Capitol in favor of fellow Ponca Chief Standing Bear as setting the standard in representing Native Americans in the proper light, saying the non-partisan decision to honor a significant event in American history \"will help spread the story and better help all Americans to understand our story.” He advocates changing Columbus Day to Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In 2018, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed a law changing the name of Columbus Day to Native American Day; however, former Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin vetoed that legislation claiming that \"combining a new Native American Day designation with the current Columbus Day holiday could be viewed as an intentional attempt to diminish \n\n been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast. These are the following. The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.\n\nQuestion: what ethnic group celebrates its contribution to america in october\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These individual totals were each the highest of the Games, after a final-day tally of 3 gold medals (women's basketball, women's omnium, and women's volleyball) closely surpassed China's total of 38 golds. Overall, the medal total was slightly lower than five years prior in Rio de Janeiro, where the United States won 46 gold and 121 total medals. As Los Angeles will be the host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, the United States, along with France, who is hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, marched in the opening ceremony just before the host nation Japan.\n\n Brazil was the host nation of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's twenty-second appearance at the Summer Olympics, having competed in all editions in the modern era from 1920 onwards, except the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. Setting a milestone in Olympic history, Brazil became the first South American country to host the Summer Olympics, and the second Latin American host following the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico. In this edition, Brazil beat both its previous highest number of gold medals obtained at one Olympics until this games (five gold medals in Athens 2004), and its record of total medals won at a Games (17 medals in Beijing 2008 and London 2012). Brazil won gold for the first time in two sports: boxing (Robson Conceição in men's lightweight) and football (men's team). It was also the first time a Brazilian athlete won three medals at one Games: Isaquias Queiroz in canoeing (two silvers and one bronze). Brazil also won its first ever medals in canoeing sprint, the silver that Queiroz won in C1-1000 m was the first in that sport.\n\n The United States of America (USA) was the host nation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. 646 competitors, 375 men and 271 women, took part in 263 events in 31 sports. The team finished first in the overall medal rankings for the first time since 1984, and for the first time since 1968 in a non-boycotted Summer Olympics.\n\n The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird. Javelin thrower Kara Winger was the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony. The country finished \n\n London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times, having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948. Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability. The main focus was a new 200 ha Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London. The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid. The United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the US became the most \n\nQuestion: make it or break it who goes to the olympics\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive burns. It was later discovered that treatment of deep skin wounds in adult animals and humans with this scaffold induces regeneration of the dermis. It has been developed commercially under the name Integra and is used in massively burned patients, during plastic surgery of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds.\n\nAlternatively, the term “artificial skin” sometimes is used to refer to skin-like tissue grown in a laboratory, although this technology is still quite a way away from being viable for use in the medical field.  'Artificial skin' can also refer to flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs, (also experimental).\n\nBackground\nThe skin is the largest organ in the human body.  Skin is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis and the fat layer, also called the hypodermis.  The epidermis is the outer layer of skin that keeps vital fluids in and harmful bacteria out of the body.  The dermis is the inner layer of skin that contains blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, oil, and sweat glands.  Severe damage to large areas of skin exposes the human organism to dehydration and infections that can result in death.\n\nTraditional ways of dealing with large losses of skin have been to use skin grafts from the patient (autografts) or from an unrelated donor or a cadaver.  The former approach has the disadvantage that there may not be enough skin available, while the latter suffers from the possibility of rejection or infection.  Until the late twentieth century, skin grafts were constructed from the patient's own skin.  This became a problem when skin had been damaged extensively, making it impossible to treat severely injured patients with autografts only.\n\nRegenerated skin: discovery and clinical use\nA process for inducing regeneration in skin was invented by Dr. Ioannis V. Yannas (then an assistant professor in the Fibers and Polymers Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Dr. John F. Burke (then chief of staff at Shriners Burns Institute in Boston, Massachusetts). Their initial objective was to discover a wound cover that would protect severe skin wounds from infection by accelerating wound closure. Several kinds of grafts made of synthetic and natural polymers were prepared and tested in a guinea pig animal model. By the late 1970s it was evident that the original objective was not reached. Instead, these experimental grafts typically did not affect the speed of wound closure. In one case, however, a particular type of collagen graft led to significant delay of wound closure.  Careful study of histology samples revealed that grafts that delayed wound closure induced the synthesis of new dermis de novo at the injury site, instead of forming scar, which is the normal outcome of the spontaneous wound healing response. This was the first demonstration of regeneration of a tissue (dermis) that does not regenerate by itself in the adult mammal. After the initial discovery, further research led to the composition and fabrication of grafts that were evaluated in clinical trials. These grafts were synthesized as a graft copolymer of microfibrillar type I collagen and a glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin-6-sulfate, fabricated into porous sheets by freeze-drying, and then cross-linked by dehydrothermal treatment. Control of the structural features of the collagen scaffold (average pore size, degradation rate and surface chemistry) was eventually found to be a critical prerequisite for its unusual biological activity. In 1981 Burke and Yannas proved that their artificial skin worked on patients with 50 to 90 percent burns, vastly improving the chances of recovery and improved quality of life. John F. Burke also claimed, in 1981, \"[The Artificial skin] is soft and pliable, not stiff and hard, unlike other substances used to cover burned-off skin.\"\n\nSeveral patents were granted to MIT for the creation of collagen-based grafts that can induce dermis regeneration. U.S. Patent 4,418,691 (December 6, 1983) was cited by the National Inventors Hall of Fame as the key patent describing the invention of a process for regenerated skin (Inductees Natl. Inventors Hall of Fame, 2015). These patents were later translated into a commercial product by Integra LifeSciences Corp., a company founded in 1989. Integra Dermal Regeneration Template received FDA approval in 1996, and the FDA listed it as a \"Significant Medical Device Breakthrough\" in the same year. Since then, it has been applied worldwide to treat patients who are in need of new skin to treat massive burns and traumatic skin wounds, those undergoing plastic surgery of the skin, as well as others who suffer from certain forms of skin cancer.\n\nIn clinical practice, a thin graft sheet manufactured from the active collagen scaffold is placed on the injury site, which is then covered with a thin sheet of silicone elastomer that protects the wound site from bacterial infection and dehydration. The graft can be seeded with autologous cells (keratinocytes) in order to accelerate wound closure, however the presence of these cells is not required for regenerating the dermis. Grafting skin wounds with Integra leads to the synthesis of normal vascularized and innervated dermis de novo, followed by re-epithelization and formation of epidermis. Although early versions of the scaffold were not capable of regenerating hair follicles and sweat glands, later developments by S.T Boyce and coworkers led to solution of this problem.\n\nThe mechanism of regeneration using an active collagen scaffold has been largely clarified. The scaffold retains regenerative activity provided that it has been prepared with appropriate levels of the specific surface (pore size in range 20-125 µm), degradation rate  (degradation half-life 14 ± 7 days) and surface chemical features (ligand densities for integrins α1β1 and α2β1 must exceed approximately 200 μΜ α1β1 and α2β1 ligands).  It has been hypothesized that specific binding of a sufficient number of contractile cells (myofibroblasts) on the scaffold surface, occurring within a narrow time window, is required for induction of skin regeneration in the presence of this scaffold. Studies with skin wounds have been extended to transected peripheral nerves, and the combined evidence supports a common regeneration mechanism for skin and peripheral nerves using this scaffold.\n\nFurther research\nResearch is continually being done on artificial skin. Newer technologies, such as an autologous spray-on skin produced by Avita Medical, are being tested in efforts to accelerate healing and minimize scarring.\n\nThe Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology is working towards a fully automated process for producing artificial skin. Their goal is a simple two-layer skin without blood vessels that can be used to study how skin interacts with consumer products, such as creams and medicines. They hope to eventually produce more complex skin that can be used in transplants.\n\nHanna Wendt, and a team of her colleagues in the Department of Plastic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical School Hannover Germany, have found a method for creating artificial skin using spider silk. Before this, however, artificial skin was grown using materials like collagen.  These materials did not seem strong enough. Instead, Wendt and her team turned to spider silk, which is known to be 5 times stronger than Kevlar.  The silk is harvested by “milking” the silk glands of golden orb web spiders. The silk was spooled as it was harvested, and then it was woven into a rectangular steel frame. The steel frame was 0.7 mm thick, and the resulting weave was easy to handle or sterilize.  Human skin cells were added to the meshwork silk and were found to flourish under an environment providing nutrients, warmth and air. However at this time, using spider silk to grow artificial skin in mass quantities is not practical because of the tedious process of harvesting spider silk.\n\nAustralian researchers are currently searching for a new, innovative way to produce artificial skin. This would produce artificial skin more quickly and in a more efficient way. The skin produced would only be 1 millimeter thick and would only be used to rebuild the epidermis. They can also make the skin 1.5 millimetres thick, which would allow the dermis to repair itself if needed. This would require bone marrow from a donation or from the patient's body.  The bone marrow would be used as a “seed,\" and would be placed in the grafts to mimic the dermis. This has been tested on animals and has been proven to work with animal skin.\nProfessor Maitz said, “In Australia, someone with a full-thickness burn to up to 80 per cent of their body surface area has every prospect of surviving the injury... However their quality of life remains questionable as we're unable, at present, to replace the burned skin with normal skin…We're committed to ensuring the pain of survival is worth it, by developing a living skin equivalent.”\n\nSynthetic skin\nAnother form of “artificial skin” has been created out of flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs.  The artificial skin is anticipated to augment robotics in conducting rudimentary jobs that would be considered delicate and require sensitive “touch”. Scientists found that by applying a layer of rubber with two parallel electrodes that stored electrical charges inside of the artificial skin, tiny amounts of pressure could be detected. When pressure is exerted, the electrical charge in the rubber is changed and the change is detected by the electrodes.\nHowever, the film is so small that when pressure is applied to the skin, the molecules have nowhere to move and become entangled. The molecules also fail to return to their original shape when the pressure is removed. A recent development in the synthetic skin technique has been made by imparting the color changing properties to the thin layer of silicon with the help of artificial ridges which reflect a very specific wavelength of light. By tuning the spaces between these ridges, color to be reflected by the skin can be controlled. This technology can be used in color-shifting camouflages and sensors that can detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges, and aircraft.\n\n3D printers\nUniversidad Carlos III de Madrid, Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón and BioDan Group created a 3D bioprinter capable of creating human skin that functions exactly as real skin does.\n\nReferences\n\nSkin\nSkin\nSynthetic biology\n\nArtificial skin is a collagen scaffold that induces regeneration of skin in mammals such as humans.

It has been developed commercially under the name Integra and is used in massively burned patients, during plastic surgery of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds.\n\nAlternatively, the term “artificial skin” sometimes is used to refer to skin-like tissue grown in a laboratory, although this technology is still quite a way away from being viable for use in the medical field.  'Artificial skin' can also refer to flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs, (also experimental).\n\nBackground\nThe skin is the largest organ in the human body.  Skin is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis and the fat layer, also called the hypodermis.  The epidermis is the outer layer of skin that keeps vital fluids in and harmful bacteria out of the body.  The dermis is the inner layer of skin that contains blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, oil, and sweat glands.  Severe damage to large areas of skin exposes the human organism to dehydration and infections that can result in death.\n\nTraditional ways of dealing with large losses of skin have been to use skin grafts from the patient (autografts) or from an unrelated donor or a cadaver.  The former approach has the disadvantage that there may not be enough skin available, while the latter suffers from the possibility of rejection or infection.  Until the late twentieth century, skin grafts were constructed from the patient's own skin.  This became a problem when skin had been damaged extensively, making it impossible to treat severely injured patients with autografts only.\n\nRegenerated skin: discovery and clinical use\nA process for inducing regeneration in skin was invented by Dr. Ioannis V. Yannas (then an assistant professor in the Fibers and Polymers Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Dr. John F. Burke (then chief of staff at Shriners Burns Institute in Boston, Massachusetts). Their initial objective was to discover a wound cover that would protect severe skin wounds from infection by accelerating wound closure. Several kinds of grafts made of synthetic and natural polymers were prepared and tested in a guinea pig animal model. By the late 1970s it was evident that the original objective was not reached. Instead, these experimental grafts typically did not affect the speed of wound closure. In one case, however, a particular type of collagen graft led to significant delay of wound closure.  Careful study of histology samples revealed that grafts that delayed wound closure induced the synthesis of new dermis de novo at the injury site, instead of forming scar, which is the normal outcome of the spontaneous wound healing response. This was the first demonstration of regeneration of a tissue (dermis) that does not regenerate by itself in the adult mammal. After the initial discovery, further research led to the composition and fabrication of grafts that were evaluated in clinical trials. These grafts were synthesized as a graft copolymer of microfibrillar type I collagen and a glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin-6-sulfate, fabricated into porous sheets by freeze-drying, and then cross-linked by dehydrothermal treatment. Control of the structural features of the collagen scaffold (average pore size, degradation rate and surface chemistry) was eventually found to be a critical prerequisite for its unusual biological activity. In 1981 Burke and Yannas proved that their artificial skin worked on patients with 50 to 90 percent burns, vastly improving the chances of recovery and improved quality of life. John F. Burke also claimed, in 1981, \"[The Artificial skin] is soft and pliable, not stiff and hard, unlike other substances used to cover burned-off skin.\"\n\nSeveral patents were granted to MIT for the creation of collagen-based grafts that can induce dermis regeneration. U.S. Patent 4,418,691 (December 6, 1983) was cited by the National Inventors Hall of Fame as the key patent describing the invention of a process for regenerated skin (Inductees Natl. Inventors Hall of Fame, 2015). These patents were later translated into a commercial product by Integra LifeSciences Corp., a company founded in 1989. Integra Dermal Regeneration Template received FDA approval in 1996, and the FDA listed it as a \"Significant Medical Device Breakthrough\" in the same year. Since then, it has been applied worldwide to treat patients who are in need of new skin to treat massive burns and traumatic skin wounds, those undergoing plastic surgery of the skin, as well as others who suffer from certain forms of skin cancer.\n\nIn clinical practice, a thin graft sheet manufactured from the active collagen scaffold is placed on the injury site, which is then covered with a thin sheet of silicone elastomer that protects the wound site from bacterial infection and dehydration. The graft can be seeded with autologous cells (keratinocytes) in order to accelerate wound closure, however the presence of these cells is not required for regenerating the dermis. Grafting skin wounds with Integra leads to the synthesis of normal vascularized and innervated dermis de novo, followed by re-epithelization and formation of epidermis. Although early versions of the scaffold were not capable of regenerating hair follicles and sweat glands, later developments by S.T Boyce and coworkers led to solution of this problem.\n\nThe mechanism of regeneration using an active collagen scaffold has been largely clarified. The scaffold retains regenerative activity provided that it has been prepared with appropriate levels of the specific surface (pore size in range 20-125 µm), degradation rate  (degradation half-life 14 ± 7 days) and surface chemical features (ligand densities for integrins α1β1 and α2β1 must exceed approximately 200 μΜ α1β1 and α2β1 ligands).  It has been hypothesized that specific binding of a sufficient number of contractile cells (myofibroblasts) on the scaffold surface, occurring within a narrow time window, is required for induction of skin regeneration in the presence of this scaffold. Studies with skin wounds have been extended to transected peripheral nerves, and the combined evidence supports a common regeneration mechanism for skin and peripheral nerves using this scaffold.\n\nFurther research\nResearch is continually being done on artificial skin. Newer technologies, such as an autologous spray-on skin produced by Avita Medical, are being tested in efforts to accelerate healing and minimize scarring.\n\nThe Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology is working towards a fully automated process for producing artificial skin. Their goal is a simple two-layer skin without blood vessels that can be used to study how skin interacts with consumer products, such as creams and medicines. They hope to eventually produce more complex skin that can be used in transplants.\n\nHanna Wendt, and a team of her colleagues in the Department of Plastic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery at Medical School Hannover Germany, have found a method for creating artificial skin using spider silk. Before this, however, artificial skin was grown using materials like collagen.  These materials did not seem strong enough. Instead, Wendt and her team turned to spider silk, which is known to be 5 times stronger than Kevlar.  The silk is harvested by “milking” the silk glands of golden orb web spiders. The silk was spooled as it was harvested, and then it was woven into a rectangular steel frame. The steel frame was 0.7 mm thick, and the resulting weave was easy to handle or sterilize.  Human skin cells were added to the meshwork silk and were found to flourish under an environment providing nutrients, warmth and air. However at this time, using spider silk to grow artificial skin in mass quantities is not practical because of the tedious process of harvesting spider silk.\n\nAustralian researchers are currently searching for a new, innovative way to produce artificial skin. This would produce artificial skin more quickly and in a more efficient way. The skin produced would only be 1 millimeter thick and would only be used to rebuild the epidermis. They can also make the skin 1.5 millimetres thick, which would allow the dermis to repair itself if needed. This would require bone marrow from a donation or from the patient's body.  The bone marrow would be used as a “seed,\" and would be placed in the grafts to mimic the dermis. This has been tested on animals and has been proven to work with animal skin.\nProfessor Maitz said, “In Australia, someone with a full-thickness burn to up to 80 per cent of their body surface area has every prospect of surviving the injury... However their quality of life remains questionable as we're unable, at present, to replace the burned skin with normal skin…We're committed to ensuring the pain of survival is worth it, by developing a living skin equivalent.”\n\nSynthetic skin\nAnother form of “artificial skin” has been created out of flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs.  The artificial skin is anticipated to augment robotics in conducting rudimentary jobs that would be considered delicate and require sensitive “touch”. Scientists found that by applying a layer of rubber with two parallel electrodes that stored electrical charges inside of the artificial skin, tiny amounts of pressure could be detected. When pressure is exerted, the electrical charge in the rubber is changed and the change is detected by the electrodes.\nHowever, the film is so small that when pressure is applied to the skin, the molecules have nowhere to move and become entangled. The molecules also fail to return to their original shape when the pressure is removed. A recent development in the synthetic skin technique has been made by imparting the color changing properties to the thin layer of silicon with the help of artificial ridges which reflect a very specific wavelength of light. By tuning the spaces between these ridges, color to be reflected by the skin can be controlled. This technology can be used in color-shifting camouflages and sensors that can detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges, and aircraft.\n\n3D printers\nUniversidad Carlos III de Madrid, Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón and BioDan Group created a 3D bioprinter capable of creating human skin that functions exactly as real skin does.\n\nReferences\n\nSkin\nSkin\nSynthetic biology\n\n Krypton (from 'the hidden one') is a chemical element with the symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically inert. Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a meter was defined by the 606-nanometer wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes.\n\nQuestion: element named after fictional planet from which superman came\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The 32 national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of 23 players, including three goalkeepers. Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament. A provisional list of 35 players per national team was submitted to FIFA by 14 May 2018, one month prior to the opening match of the tournament. From the preliminary squad, the final list of 23 players per national team was submitted to FIFA by 4 June, 10 days prior to the opening match of the tournament. FIFA published \n\n In the preliminary round and intermediate round, each group is played as a round-robin mini-tournament at one of the teams selected as hosts after the draw. In the final tournament, the eight qualified teams play a group stage (two groups of four) followed by the final between the group winners, at a host selected by UEFA from one of the teams.\n\n In the first round of the competition, teams were divided into two groups of four teams, and play followed a round robin format with each of the teams playing all other teams in the pool once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, two points for a draw and one point for a loss. All ties in the standings will be broken by point differential Following the completion of the group games, all eight teams advanced to a single elimination round consisting of four quarterfinal games, two semifinal games, and the bronze and gold medal matches. Losing teams competed in classification matches to determine their ranking in the tournament. A penalty stroke competition took place, if a classification matched ended in a draw to determine a winner. All games were played in two 7 minute halves, except the gold medal match which was played with 10-minute halves.\n\nQuestion: who plays red on orange is new black\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet. Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope. Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught \n\nThe torso or  trunk is an anatomical term for the central part, or the core, of the body of many animals (including humans), from which the head, neck, limbs, tail and other appendages extend.

The process begins in the heart, where the right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the largest vein in the body, called the vena cava. The deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium and then flows into the right ventricle.\n\nFrom the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart through the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide through the process of respiration. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins.\n\nThe oxygenated blood enters the left atrium and flows into the left ventricle. It is then pumped out of the heart through the largest artery in the body called the aorta. The aorta branches off into smaller arteries, which distribute oxygenated blood to various parts of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the cells.\n\nAs the blood reaches the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding tissues. At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the tissues into the capillaries. This exchange of gases and nutrients occurs due to the thin walls of the capillaries.\n\nOnce the oxygen and nutrients have been delivered to the tissues, the capillaries converge into larger veins, which carry the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The entire process then repeats itself, ensuring a continuous circulation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood throughout the body.\n\nIn summary, the circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the arteries, while deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart through the veins. This process is essential for supplying oxygen and nutrients to the cells and removing waste products from the body.\n\n rest of the blood flow loop is called systemic circulation system. The pulmonary and systemic circulations take the blood through large arteries first and then branches into smaller arteries before reaching arterioles and capillaries. After capillaries, the blood enters the venules before joining smaller veins first and then larger veins before reaching the right heart. Thus completing the cycle of blood going to heart and then coming from it and going to all parts of the body. The tricuspid valve, right heart (right ventricle), pulmonary valve, pulmonary artery, lungs, pulmonary veins and right heart are the elements of the Pulmonary Circulation System. The process of gas exchange, that is, exchange of carbon dioxide with oxygen in the lungs \n\nThis blood carries oxygen to all of the body except to the lungs.The contraction of the left ventricle propels blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the largest artery in the body.(In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.)FUNCTION OF THE HEART\n\nThe heart's only function is to pump blood. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed from it. The left side pumps blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen and nutrients are delivered to tissues and waste products (such as carbon dioxide) are transferred to the blood for removal by other organs (such as the lungs and kidneys). Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins (the venae cavae) into the right atrium. When the right ventricle relaxes, blood in the right atrium pours through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. When the right ventricle is nearly full, the right atrium contracts, propelling additional blood into the right ventricle, which then contracts. This contraction propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs. In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs. Here, the blood absorbs oxygen and gives up carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled. Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. When the left ventricle relaxes, the blood in the left atrium pours through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. When the left ventricle is nearly full, the left atrium contracts, propelling additional blood into the left ventricle, which then contracts. (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.) The contraction of the left ventricle propels blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. This blood carries oxygen to all of the body except to the lungs.The right coronary artery and the left coronary artery, which branch off the aorta just after it leaves the heart, deliver oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.The right coronary artery branches into the marginal artery and the posterior interventricular artery, located on the back surface of the heart.The left coronary artery branches into the circumflex and the left anterior descending artery.\n\n the main function of the pulmonary system. The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. The systemic circulation is responsible for taking the oxygenated blood to various organs and tissues via the arterial tree before taking the deoxygenated blood to the right ventricle using the venous system (a network of veins). Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood.\n\nBlood flow through the heart follows a specific pathway to ensure proper circulation throughout the body. The heart functions as a double pump in the cardiovascular system, with two circuits: the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation.\n\nIn the pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood is collected in the right atrium from the body via the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery, which branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries to supply each lung. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood.\n\nOn the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation.\n\nThroughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. These valves, including the tricuspid valve, bicuspid valve, aortic valve, and pulmonary valve, prevent the backward flow of blood, a condition known as regurgitation.\n\nIn summary, blood flows through the heart by first entering the right atrium, then passing through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. It is then pumped into the pulmonary artery through the pulmonary valve, where it undergoes gas exchange in the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues.\n\nReference:\n- Cardiac physiology or heart function is the study of healthy, unimpaired function of the heart: involving blood flow; myocardium structure; the electrical conduction system of the heart; the cardiac cycle and cardiac output and how these interact and depend on one another.\n- Blood flow: The heart functions as a pump and acts as a double pump in the cardiovascular system to provide a continuous circulation of blood throughout the body. This circulation includes the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation. Both circuits transport blood but they can also be seen in terms of the gases they carry. The pulmonary circulation collects oxygen from the lungs and delivers carbon dioxide for exhalation. The systemic circuit transports oxygen to the body and returns relatively de-oxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the pulmonary circuit.\n- Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. The pulmonary artery (also trunk) branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries to supply each lung. Blood is prevented from flowing backwards (regurgitation) by the tricuspid, bicuspid, aortic, and pulmonary valves.\n- The function of the right heart is to collect de-oxygenated blood in the right atrium from the body via the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus, and pump it through the tricuspid valve, right ventricle, semilunar pulmonary valve, and into the pulmonary artery in the pulmonary circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation.\n\nQuestion: where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The 1978 Chicago Bears came the closest to having a 1000 yard duo without succeeding, when Walter Payton finished with 1,305 yards but Roland Harper fell 8 yards short of 1,000 with 992. That would have made them the first NFC team with a 1,000 yard rushing duo. The 1973 Cincinnati Bengals came almost as close without having even one 1,000 yard rusher, with Essex Johnson finishing with 997 yards and Boobie Clark finishing with 988 yards.\n\n 19 touchdowns before throwing an interception, which is the second longest such streak in league history. ; Punter John Hekker of the St. Louis Rams set a single season record with an average of 44.2 net yards per punt, besting the mark of 44.0 yards set by Andy Lee in.

These eight rushing seasons rank as the highest single-season rushing totals in NFL history, and reaching the 2,000-yard mark is considered a significant achievement for running backs. No running back has yet achieved this feat twice. The first 2,000-yard season was recorded in 1973 by Buffalo Bills running back O. J. Simpson. Simpson is the only player ever to have surpassed 2,000 yards in a 14-game season, as all others occurred in 16-game seasons; he finished the season with 2,003 rushing yards, averaging six yards per carry and an NFL-record 143.1 rushing \n\n per game.

Miniature art has been in existence for centuries tracing its heritage back to the illustrated manuscripts of scribes in the Far East and Europe prior to the 15th century. The origin of modern trading cards is associated with cigarette cards first issued by the US-based Allen and Ginter tobacco company in 1875. They were the precursors of the sport cards and other trading cards. An important influence for the ATC concept were art movements of the 20th century which advocated a more popular art: Art not for museums or auctions but from and within everyday life. In this respect, the ATC project has affinity with the Fluxus movement and with Robert Filliou's notions of a \"fête permanente\", a \"création permanente\", or an \"eternal network\". The \"art of participation\" as an interactive process can be traced back to the 1950s, and it developed within different genres like performance art and happenings, action art, mail art, or later computer art.\n\n titled Christmas Elves. The image of the elves in the workshop was popularized by Godey's Lady's Book, with a front cover illustration for its 1873 Christmas issue showing Santa surrounded by toys and elves with the caption, \"Here we have an idea of the preparations that are made to supply the young folks with toys at Christmas time.\" During this time, Godey's was immensely influential to the birth of Christmas traditions, having shown the first widely circulated picture of a modern Christmas tree on the front cover of its 1850 Christmas issue. Additional recognition was given in Austin Thompson's 1876 work \"The House of Santa Claus, a Christmas Fairy Show for Sunday Schools.\"\n\n Cards with messages have been sporadically created and posted by individuals since the beginning of postal services. The earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer Theodore Hook. Hook posted the card, which bears a penny black stamp, to himself in 1840 from Fulham (part of London). He probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002 the postcard sold for a record £31,750. In the United States, the custom of sending through the mail, at letter rate, a picture or blank card stock that held a message, began with a card postmarked in December 1848 containing printed advertising. The first commercially produced card was created in 1861 by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who patented a private postal card, and sold the rights to Hymen Lipman, whose postcards, complete with a decorated border, were marketed as \"Lipman's Postal Card\". These cards had no images. While the United States government allowed privately printed cards as early as February 1861, they saw little use until 1870, when experiments were done on their commercial viability.\n\n former. One phase featured images of children from the 19th century posed in their rooms with their toys. Rangel's first major commercial success was designing posters for the first Grand Fair of Jalisco. For these, he created a stylized version of the Guadalajara cathedral, consisting of two triangles tied to the base of a semi circle. This design is still used to symbolize Guadalajara to this day. His best known work involved the designing of Christmas cards for UNICEF and the New York Graphic Society, which gave him international recognition. The cards were designed starting in 1963 and achieved record sales for the United Nations’ children's \n\n John Arthur Dixon (18 June 1897 - 19 May 1958) was the British founder of the eponymous manufacturer of greetings cards and postcards. Dixon was born at Cross Hills, Keighley, Yorkshire, the eldest son of Charles C. Dixon. In 1926, he moved to Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, where he bought a small printing business. Dixon was a keen photographer, and in 1937 he produced his first Christmas cards. Initially, he was producing postcards under contract for W. J. Nigh & Sons Ltd, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. From 1937 (evidenced by a postmark on a colour tinted photo card of Shanklin Old Village) he was producing postcards on his own account. In 1951, production began at an 87,000 sq ft factory was built at Newport, Isle of Wight, leased from the Ministry of Aviation. The factory was a former aircraft hangar at Parkhurst Forest. In 1951, more than 14 million greetings cards were produced and in 1955, nearly 30 million postcards. In 1958, the company began producing guidebooks. Dixon died on 19 May 1958 at the Royal Isle of Wight County Hospital, Ryde.\n\nQuestion: who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Zinc is often used for the prevention or treatment of common colds and sinusitis (inflammation of sinuses due to an infection), ulcers, sickle cell disease, celiac disease, memory impairment, and acne. Zinc is found in many common vitamin supplements and is also found in denture creams. Recently, several cases of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy were found to be caused by prolonged use of denture creams containing high quantities of zinc. A literature review found two cases of copper deficiency myelopathy secondary to parenteral zinc supplementation during chronic dialysis. Metallic zinc is the core of all United States currency coins, including copper-coated pennies. People who ingest a large number of coins will have elevated zinc levels, leading to zinc-toxicity-induced copper deficiency and the associated neurological symptoms. This was the case for a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The woman consumed over 600 coins, and started to show neurological symptoms such as unsteady gait and mild ataxia.\n\n were struck at San Francisco on April 23, 1975. The San Francisco Assay Office struck the 45,000,000 silver coins first, producing eleven million sets in uncirculated and four million in proof, then began the base metal pieces. Once striking began, the Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. The Mint modified the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type \n\n all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. Bicentennial coins for collectors were not delivered until after July 4, 1975. The Bicentennial pieces, in base metal, were included in 1975 proof sets and mint sets together with 1975-dated cents, nickels and dimes. The new coins first entered circulation on July 7, 1975, when the half dollar was released in conjunction with ceremonies in Minneapolis, Huntington's hometown. The quarter followed in September and the dollar \n\n Throughout the 18th century, the British government did not mint pennies for general circulation and the bullion value of the existing silver pennies caused them to be withdrawn from circulation. Merchants and mining companies—such as Anglesey's Parys Mining Co.—began to issue their own copper tokens to fill the need for small change. Finally, amid the Napoleonic Wars, the government authorized Matthew Boulton to mint copper pennies and twopences at Soho Mint in Birmingham in 1797. Typically, 1 lb. of copper produced 24 pennies. In 1860, the copper penny was replaced with a bronze one (95% copper, 4% tin, 1% zinc). Each pound of bronze was coined into 48 pennies.\n\n As of July 2019, there are approximately 130 billion coins in circulation around the eurozone. In contrast the United States has minted over 300 billion pennies since 1983 when the current copper-plated zinc metallic composition began. Using a population of 341.9 million for the Euro area that is roughly 188 coins of denomination 1c or 2c per capita, and 203 other coins per capita.\n\nQuestion: when did they start adding zinc to pennies\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2000, the Church of Sweden was disestablished. Sweden was the second Nordic country to disestablish its state church (after Finland did so in the Church Act of 1869). At the end of 2018, 57.7% of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden; this number had been decreasing by about 1.5 percentage points a year for the previous 7 years and one percentage point a year on average for the previous two decades. Approximately 2% of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services. The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of \n\n18% of Swedish citizens responded that \"they believe there is a god\". ; 45% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\". ; 34% answered that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\". 21% believed in a god (down from 35 percent in 2008). ; 16% believed in ghosts. ; 14% believed in creationism or intelligent design. Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping Æsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala. With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. After \n\n parents was a member. Since 1996, only children and adults who are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various Evangelical Protestant free churches (where congregation attendance is much higher), and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians and 92,000 Roman Catholics living in Sweden. The first Muslim congregation was established in 1949, when a small contingent of Tatars migrated from Finland. Islam's presence in Sweden remained marginal until the 1960s, when Sweden started to receive migrants from the Balkans and Turkey. Further immigration from North Africa and the Middle East have brought the estimated Muslim population to 600,000. However, only about 110,000 \n\n members of a congregation around 2010. According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, According to a Demoskop study in 2015 about the beliefs of the Swedish showed that Sociology professor Phil Zuckerman claims that Swedes, despite a lack of belief in God, commonly question the term atheist, preferring to call themselves Christians while being content with remaining in the Church of Sweden. Religion continues to play a role in Swedish cultural identity. This is evidenced by the fact that the majority of Swedish adults continue to remain members of the Lutheran Church despite having to pay a church tax; moreover, rates of baptism remain high and church weddings are increasing in Sweden.\n\n  The dominant religion in Slovenia is Christianity, primarily the Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination in the country. Other Christian groups having significant followings in the country include Eastern Orthodoxy and Protestantism (Lutheranism). Islam, Judaism and Hinduism are small minorities in Slovenia. About 18% of the population are either agnostic or atheist. Religion played a significant role in the development of the Slovenian nation and of the country of Slovenia. After a centuries-long tradition of a state church, interrupted by the periods of Protestant Reformation (in the 16th century) and post–World War II socialism (which ousted religion from the public life), a degree of separation of the state and the church has been reached in independent Slovenia. In February 2007 Slovenia passed a new Religious Freedom Act with a bias towards the Catholic Church (particularly in regard to state funding) and strict terms for the registration of new religious communities.\n\nQuestion: what is the most popular religion in sweden\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Fast track agreements are enacted as \"congressional-executive agreements\" (CEAs), which are negotiated for by the executive branch following set guidelines from Congress, and are approved by a majority in both chambers of Congress. Without the TPA legislation, the President's power to negotiate trade deals is restricted by Article II, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution which states that: \"[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.\" If a trade agreement that reduces tariffs or non-tariff barriers to trade negotiated by the executive branch meets the guidelines set by Congress, the TPA allows Congress to \"consider the required \n\n The Senate, along with the House, must approve any treaties or other international agreements signed by the president. Should the president veto any bill passed by the House and the Senate, the veto may be overturned by a vote of two-thirds of the members in each chamber. The Constitution also grants the Senate several exclusive powers to check the actions of the executive branch. Under Article 54, the president's appointments of ministers, judges, county officials, military officers and other officers must be confirmed by the Senate. The Senate is also responsible for trying the president, the vice president, and judges in the event that they are impeached by the House. Conviction and removal from office requires the consent of two-thirds of the senators.\n\n The practice on legislative approval of treaties before ratification varies from country to country. In most countries, the constitution requires most treaties to be approved by the legislature before they can formally enter into force and bind the country in question. This is particularly the case in states where international treaties become part of domestic law directly, without the need for special implementation as required in the case of the United Kingdom. In countries with a strong separation of powers, this may lead to treaties being signed by the executive, but not being ratified because of legislative opposition. In the United States, the president must submit treaties to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification, which requires a two-thirds vote. A famous example of a treaty not receiving consent is \n\n The President sets the tone for all foreign policy. The State Department and all members design and implement all details to the President's policy. The Treaty Clause in Article Two of the United States Constitution dictates that the President of the United States negotiates treaties with other countries or political entities, and signs them. Signed treaties enter into force only if ratified by at least two-thirds (67 members) of the United States Senate.

Doehner, his parents, older brother and sister—all naturalized Mexican nationals at the time —were returning to New Jersey from a vacation in Germany on the, planning to continue to Mexico City by train. His father, sister, and 34 others were killed when it caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst in Manchester Township on May 6, 1937. Hydrogen, exposed to air, had triggered an inferno somewhere on the airship, causing flames to flicker atop the airship, which then ignited the airship as it attempted but failed to land. On the 80th anniversary \n\n Although Max Pruss was the commanding officer of the last flight of the Hindenburg, Captain Lehmann was the most senior officer on board, but was there only as an observer. He was severely burned when the ship caught fire at Lakehurst on 6 May 1937, and died the following day. It was initially believed that Lehmann would recover from his injuries; he was scheduled to be transferred to the hospital at Rockefeller University for further treatment until he took a sudden turn for the worse in the morning before his death. At his death, he apparently believed that the Hindenburg was sabotaged. He came out of the burning wreckage saying \"I don't understand it.\" During a deathbed conversation with Commander Charles Emery Rosendahl, he said \"it must have been an infernal machine.\" Lehmann's two-year-old son had died on Easter Sunday, 28 March 1937, a few weeks prior to the Hindenburg's last crossing and he did not really want to make the voyage. Lehmann accepted the assignment with the hope that by doing so he might have the opportunity to speak to US authorities about the use of helium gas in the German airships.\n\n LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of the Hindenburg class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH) on the shores of Lake Constance in Friedrichshafen, Germany, and was operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. The airship flew from March 1936 until it was destroyed by fire 14 months later on May 6, 1937 while attempting to land at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Manchester Township, New Jersey, at the end of the first North American transatlantic journey of her second season of service. This was the last of the great airship disasters; it was preceded by the crashes of the British R38, the US airship Roma, the French Dixmude, the British R101, and the USS Akron.\n\n The Hindenburg disaster was an airship accident that occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, United States. The German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. The accident caused 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen) from the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), and an additional fatality on the ground. The disaster was the subject of newsreel coverage, photographs and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of hypotheses have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The publicity shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era.\n\n Graf Zeppelin, the operation was almost profitable. In the mid-1930s, work began on an airship designed specifically to operate a passenger service across the Atlantic. The Hindenburg (LZ 129) completed a successful 1936 season, carrying passengers between Lakehurst, New Jersey and Germany. The year 1937 started with the most spectacular and widely remembered airship accident. Approaching the Lakehurst mooring mast minutes before landing on 6 May 1937, the Hindenburg suddenly burst into flames and crashed to the ground. Of the 97 people aboard, 36 died: 13 passengers, 22 aircrew, and one American ground-crewman.

They married on November 21, 1987, and had three daughters: Rumer (born August 16, 1988), Scout (born July 20, 1991), and Tallulah (born February 3, 1994). Willis and Moore announced their separation on June 24, 1998. They filed for divorce on October 18, 2000, and the divorce was finalized later that day. Regarding the divorce, Willis stated, \"I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.\" He credited actor Will Smith for helping him cope with the situation. He has maintained a close friendship with both Moore and her subsequent husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and attended their wedding. Willis was engaged to actress Brooke Burns until they broke up in 2004 after 10 months together. He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009; guests included his three daughters, as well as Moore and Kutcher. The ceremony was not legally binding, so the couple wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills six days later. The couple have two daughters: Mabel (born April 2012) and Evelyn (born May 2014).\n\n the duo fear no one will attend their wedding. Marsh explained that Janae and Boyd do not want to risk any more problems they decide to marry in a small registry office ceremony. Boyd's sister Summer Hoyland (Marissa Siketa) supports her brother but she tells Max and Janelle about the wedding. Their relatives arrive unannounced at the wedding, Marsh described the scenes as \"a lot of trouble\". The actor believed the wedding was very low-key and filming the event felt like a normal day on set. The pair do not wear traditional wedding attire and Marsh did not think it made their marriage look \n\n and All in the Family, before beginning her daytime acting career with a six-year stint on Days of Our Lives. Weaver is active on the night club circuit, and has opened for Bob Newhart, Don Rickles, Jerry Lewis, and George Burns in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. She was a regular on some of the most prominent telethons and has helped to raise millions of dollars for charities. Weaver lives in Southern California. She divorced her first husband, an attorney, when he became physically abusive to her, and a few years later, she married actor Gary Faga. She was later married to former Y&R writer Jerry Birn from 1994 until his death in 2009.\n\n (Tina Huang) threatens to prosecute the heavily pregnant Lani for aiding and abetting unless Eli can get Kristen to confess. A reluctant Eli successfully records Kristen's confession. Instead of taking it to Melinda, Eli goes to Kristen and convinces her to confess before he turns the recording over. But Lani soon uncovers what Eli did and kicks him out of their home. The couple reconcile on Christmas Eve after Julie and her husband Doug (Bill Hayes) intervene. Lani goes into labor during the Horton tree trimming ceremony and on Christmas Day the couple welcomes their twins, Jules and Carver.\n\n Her first marriage was to The Donna Reed Show actor Paul Petersen in 1967. In 1969, Benet left Petersen for actor Bill Bixby. After her divorce from Petersen became final, she married Bixby in 1971. The couple had a child, Christopher Sean, in September 1974, and then divorced in 1980. After the divorce and until her death, Benet was in a relationship with future pundit Tammy Bruce. Benet experienced a number of personal and professional challenges after her divorce from Bixby. Her role on Days of Our Lives made her extremely unpopular with fans; Benet's character was breaking up one of the show's popular couples, Doug and Julie, and fans were outraged. However, Benet's most personal challenge occurred when her six-year-old son Christopher died in March 1981. While they were on a weekend ski trip at Mammoth Lakes, Christopher suffered acute epiglottitis, going into a coma and cardiac arrest after doctors subsequently carried out a tracheotomy.\n\nQuestion: days of our lives cast doug and julie\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was composed by Diane Warren and released as a single from Heart's ninth studio album, Bad Animals. \"Who Will You Run To\" is one of a long list of hit songs written by Warren. Heart's version of her song became the band's eighth U.S. top-ten single, peaking at number seven. It also climbed to number thirty in the UK Singles Chart, where it was also available as a 12\" single. An extended rock version of the song was Heart's first UK CD single release.\n\n \"I'll Come Running\" is a song written by Neil Diamond. It was first released by Diamond in July 1966 as the B-side to his US top-ten single \"Cherry, Cherry\", before being included on his debut album The Feel of Neil Diamond, released in August 1966. The song was later covered by British singer Cliff Richard and released as a single in June 1967 which peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)\" is a song written by Murray Kellum and Dan Mitchell, and recorded by American country music band Alabama. It was released in July 1984 as the B-side of the third single from the band's Roll On album. Though \"I'm Not That Way Anymore\" was released as the A-side, radio programmers preferred the flipside and the song became the group's 14th consecutive number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. During the first weeks \"If You're Gonna Play in Texas...\" was on the Billboard chart, \"I'm Not That Way Anymore\" charted concurrently, being listed as a tag-along B-side. Since \"I'm Not That Way\" was intended as the A-side, the song had an accompanying music video which was filmed at Fort Payne High School. The chorus references \"Faded Love\" by Texas musician Bob Wills and \"Louisiana Man\" by Doug Kershaw repeatedly throughout this song. The song was used as the basis of \"If You're Gonna Run in Texas\", a radio campaign advertisement produced as part of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz's reelection campaign in 2018.\n\n Singer Paul Robb said, \"\"Walking Away\" was a song where I sat down and said, \"I want to write a song that's kind of like \"What's on Your Mind,\" but it's going to be directed to some former members of our band who had sort of quit the band at an importune moment. As a matter of fact, they both quit right before we made it big with \"Running.\" So if you listen to the lyrics of \"Walking Away,\" it's basically just someone complaining about people who left. That's because that's exactly what it is. It's a very transparent song - there's no deep meanings in that one.\"\n\n Wexler had her record the Bert Berns penned and produced song, \"I'm Gonna Run Away From You\", for Atco Records, but the song was not released at the time, although it was released in the UK on Atlantic (AT.4071). In 1971, \"I'm Gonna Run Away From You\" was released as a single, with \"The Boy Next Door\" as the B-side, on Mojo and Atlantic, where it became a hit in the UK among devotees of Northern soul. The tune hit number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in 1971. A full-length album, Love Is Here and Now You're Gone, followed in 1972, produced by John Abbey, and was reissued on CD in 2005 by DBK Works.

Some movie theaters feature a wider selection than simply snacks and popcorn. These \"dine-in\" theaters allow patrons to purchase \"meals\" (ranging from pizza slices to hamburgers and more) that can be consumed while watching the movie. Many theaters have embraced the \"brew and view\" concept, serving alcoholic beverages, in addition to snacks and popcorn. Some movie theaters such as the Living Room Theaters or Alamo Drafthouse offer full restaurant service at one's seat, though this is not as widespread. McMenamins is a chain of restaurant/brewpub establishments in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington, many of which have full \n\n claimed inventions before they were fully realized, or claimed priority with vague evidence after others had introduced some advancement. Even if chauvinistic motives were put aside, many publications on the history of film have favored one or just a few inventors who would have been the very first to introduce movies in a way that the medium became so successful and influential. Writer Homer Croy described in his 1918 book How Motion Pictures Are Made, how Charles Francis Jenkins would have presented the first motion picture on a large screen on 6 June 1894 in Richmond, Indiana, with his parents, brothers, other family members, friends and some newspaper \n\n showings in response to patron complaints and requests. Vue Cinemas chain introduced adults-only screenings of films in 2008, noting customer complaints about a \"hubbub of noise\" from children at afternoon screenings. In 2008, the Picturehouse Cinemas in the United Kingdom experimented with a ban on popcorn, partly in response to requests from patrons. Empire Cinemas promoted its own etiquette guide in 2012, displaying it on posters in auditoriums. The Alamo Drafthouse theater chain is known for strictly enforcing a strict etiquette code for audiences, and used an irate customer's telephone complaint about being ejected for violating it as part of their marketing.\n\n Act II is an American brand of microwave popcorn that is ostensibly based on the look and taste of movie theater popcorn. It is currently made and distributed by Conagra Brands. Act II was preceded in the popcorn market by Act I, an early microwave popcorn that had to be stored in the refrigerator due to its real butter content. Act I was introduced in 1981. In 1984, Act II, a shelf stable microwave popcorn was released, becoming the first mass-marketed microwave popcorn. Act II was manufactured by the Golden Valley Microwave Foods (frequently abbreviated as GVMF on the packaging) company of Edina, Minnesota. GVMF was later bought by ConAgra Foods in 1991. The Edina facility was closed and manufacturing moved to other manufacturing plants in the US and Mexico. The popcorn bag used in Act II was invented by James Watkins, a former engineer for the Pillsbury Company in Minneapolis, MN and then Founder/President of Golden Valley Microwave Foods.\n\n By 1900, Cretors introduced the Special, the first large horse-drawn popcorn wagon. It was an immediate success. Three variations of this wagon were created. This was when electricity was becoming available. Cretors created the first popcorn machine with an electric motor. Thus, C. Cretors and Company holds one of the oldest active Underwriters Laboratories numbers (EA175) for electrically operated machinery. The electric poppers soon took to market and electricity became the choice of power, as steam power had a reputation for being complicated and dangerous.  As movie theater attendance grew through the 1920s, Cretors began designing machines that could pop and hold more of the product. Popcorn continued to grow in popularity through the Great Depression due to its low cost.\n\nQuestion: who came up with popcorn at the movies\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Blood consists of the red blood cells or erythrocytes, white blood cells or leukocytes, and platelets or thrombocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide are known as Erythrocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in phagocytosis (the process of destruction of unknown particulate matter) and immune responses are known as Leukocytes; thrombocytes are the components of blood which are involved in blood clotting. In addition \n\n these 55 to 60 percent of blood by volume consists of plasma. Plasma is the transparent, amber-colored liquid in which the cellular components of blood are suspended. Plasma contains constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. The serum is blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed. Blood accounts for 6 to 8 percent of body weight in normal, healthy humans. The density of blood is slightly greater than the density of water at approximately 1060 kg/m3. The increased density comes from the increased density of a red blood cell compared with the density of water or plasma. Rheology is the study of the deformation \n\n The fluids associated with the human body include air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, solvents, solutions, suspensions, serum, lymph, and blood. The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is \"Blood\". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. The blood flow in arteries and veins are closely linked to the blood vessel properties.

The ECF includes **interstitial fluid** (fluid between cells, sometimes called the \"third space\"); blood, lymph, bone, and connective tissue water; and the transcellular fluids. **Transcellular fluids** are the fluids in special body spaces and include cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid. ICF contains the remaining two thirds (about 25 L) of total body water. Fig. 13-1 shows the normal distribution of total body water. FIG. 13-1 Normal distribution of total body water in adults. Water is needed to deliver dissolved nutrients, electrolytes, and other substances to all organs, tissues, and cells. In the healthy adult, the volume of water in the fluid compartments remains within the normal range although the water moves constantly between compartments. Changes in either the amount of water or the amount of electrolytes in body fluids can affect the functioning of all cells, tissues, and organs. _For proper function, the volume of all body fluids and the types and amount of dissolved substances must be carefully balanced._\n\n# Anatomy and Physiology Review\n\n## Physiologic Influences on Fluid and Electrolyte Balance\n\nBody fluids are composed of water and particles dissolved or suspended in water. The **solvent** is the water portion of fluids. **Solutes** are the particles dissolved or suspended in the water. Solutes vary in type and amount from one fluid space to another.Body function depends on keeping the correct balance of fluid and electrolytes within each body fluid space.Three processes are important to control normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and they work together to maintain balance so the internal environment remains stable even when the external environment changes.These processes are filtration, diffusion, and osmosis.\n\nThe interstitial fluid compartment is a part of the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment. In the human body, the total body water is divided into different fluid compartments, with the interstitial fluid volume being one of them. The interstitial fluid is the fluid found outside both the cells and the blood vessels.\n\nIn terms of composition, the interstitial fluid consists of various substances that are necessary for the functioning of cells and tissues. It contains nutrients, oxygen, hormones, electrolytes, and waste products. These substances are exchanged between the blood and the cells through the capillary walls.\n\nThe interstitial fluid compartment is approximately 12 liters in volume, while the total ECF compartment is around 14-15 liters. The remaining volume of the ECF compartment is occupied by the intravascular fluid (blood plasma).\n\nIt's important to note that the interstitial fluid compartment is further divided into the lymphatic fluid compartment and the transcellular fluid compartment. The lymphatic fluid accounts for about 2/3 of the interstitial fluid volume, while the transcellular fluid accounts for the remaining 1/3.\n\nTo summarize, the interstitial fluid compartment is an essential component of the extracellular fluid compartment. It contains nutrients, oxygen, and waste products that are exchanged between the blood and the cells. Understanding the composition and dynamics of the interstitial fluid is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and overall health.\n\nReference: Body fluids, bodily fluids, or biofluids are liquids within the human body. In lean healthy adult men, the total body water is about 60% (60–67%) of the total body weight; it is usually slightly lower in women (52-55%). The exact percentage of fluid relative to body weight is inversely proportional to the percentage of body fat. A lean 70 kg (160 pound) man, for example, has about 42 (42–47) liters of water in his body.\nThe total body of water is divided into fluid compartments, between the intracellular fluid (ICF) compartment (also called space, or volume) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment (space, volume) in a two-to-one ratio: 28 (28–32) liters are inside cells and 14 (14–15) liters are outside cells.\nThe ECF compartment is divided into the interstitial fluid volume – the fluid outside both the cells and the blood vessels – and the intravascular volume (also called the vascular volume and blood plasma volume) – the fluid inside the blood vessels – in a three-to-one ratio: the interstitial fluid volume is about 12 liters, the vascular volume is about 4 liters.\nThe interstitial fluid compartment is divided into the lymphatic fluid compartment – about 2/3's, or 8 (6–10) liters; the transcellular fluid compartment is the remaining 1/3, or about 4 liters.\n\nQuestion: what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was founded in 1804 by Napoleon I, the son of Genoese nobleman Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia (née Ramolino). Napoleon was a French military leader who rose to power during the French Revolution and who, in 1804, transformed the First French Republic into the First French Empire, five years after his coup d'état of November 1799 (18 Brumaire). Napoleon and the Grande Armée had to fight against every major European power (except for the ones he was allied with, including Denmark-Norway) and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, expanding the power \n\n The French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The French Revolution began in 1789 and immediately found supporters among the Italian people. The local Italian rulers, sensing danger in their own country, drew closer to the European kings who opposed France. After the French king was overthrown and France became a republic, secret clubs favouring an Italian republic were formed throughout Italy. The armies of the French Republic began to move across Europe. In 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte led a French army into northern Italy and drove out the Austrian rulers. Once again, Italy was the scene of battle between the Habsburgs and the French. Wherever France conquered, Italian republics were set up, with constitutions and legal reforms. Napoleon made himself emperor in 1804, and part of northern and central Italy was unified under the name of \n\n laws and institutions in peaceful fashion. After Russia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism. France took direct control of the Rhineland 1794–1814 and radically and permanently liberalized the government, society and economy. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. The most important impact came from the abolition of all feudal privileges and historic taxes, the introduction of legal reforms of the Napoleonic Code, and the reorganization of the judicial and local administrative systems. \n\n The French Empire (or Napoleonic Empire) formally existed during two periods when the head of the French state was a monarch who held the title of Emperor of the French. The First French Empire was the regime established by Napoleon I in France. This empire lasted from 1804 to 1814, from the Consulate of the First French Republic to the Bourbon Restoration, and was briefly restored during the Hundred Days in 1815. The Second French Empire was the regime established in France by Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic. Napoleon III was the third son of Louis Bonaparte, a younger brother of Napoleon I, and Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Napoleon I's \n\n Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

The series consisted of 46 episodes. Lucy Raffety continues her role as series producer, while Simon Harper continues his role as the show's executive producer. Sixteen regular cast members reprised their roles from the previous series. The series, which is billed as \"The Year of the Paramedic\", begins with a motorway collision stunt sequence, and features a crossover episode with spin-off series, Holby City. This series featured the departures of six cast members, including Amanda Mealing as Connie Beauchamp, Azuka Oforka as Louise Tyler and Chelsea Halfpenny as Alicia Munroe. Four new regular cast members also joined the series, while two actors began appearing in a recurring capacity.\n\nCast\n\nOverview \nThe thirty-third series of Casualty features a cast of characters working in the emergency department of Holby City Hospital. The majority of the cast from the previous series continue to appear in this series. Amanda Mealing appears as clinical lead and consultant in emergency medicine Connie Beauchamp, while William Beck, George Rainsford and Jaye Griffiths portray consultants Dylan Keogh, Ethan Hardy, and Elle Gardner respectively. Chelsea Halfpenny portrays specialty registrar Alicia Munroe, who later specialises in pediatric emergency medicine. Neet Mohan appears as F1 doctor Rash Masum, while Derek Thompson stars as Charlie Fairhead, the clinical nurse manager, senior charge nurse and emergency nurse practitioner. Cathy Shipton appears as Lisa \"Duffy\" Duffin, a sister and midwife. Charles Venn portrays senior staff nurse Jacob Masters, while Azuka Oforka features as staff nurse Louise Tyler, who is later promoted to senior staff nurse. Amanda Henderson and Jason Durr play staff nurses Robyn Miller and David Hide. Charlotte Salt, Michael Stevenson and Maddy Hill portray paramedics Sam Nicholls, Iain Dean, and Ruby Spark respectively. Tony Marshall stars as receptionist Noel Garcia. Additionally, four cast members feature on the series in a recurring capacity: Rebecca Ryan features as porter Gemma Dean; Kai Thorne portrays Blake Gardner; Joe Gaminara appears as F1 doctor Eddie McAllister; and Di Botcher plays operational duty manager and paramedic Jan Jenning.\n\nIn the opening episode of the series, Sam is killed off after succumbing to injuries sustained in a motorway collision. Salt, who had returned during the previous series, decided to leave again, but was shocked to discover her character would die. She was glad that her departure was kept hidden and felt it had a greater impact. Gaminara makes his last appearance in episode 3 after pleading guilty to attacking Alicia. Halfpenny opted to leave her role as Alicia in 2018 after deciding to pursue other roles. Alicia departs in episode 20. Oforka also chose to leave her role as Louise, having appeared in the show since series 26. The character's exit was not announced beforehand and Louise leaves in episode 24 after an ongoing financial struggle. Oforka thanked fans for their support on social network Twitter and expressed her delight at working on the drama. Griffiths' exit from the series was announced on 4 May 2019; her character left in episode 36. Mohan took a four-month break from the series in 2019 and his character departed in episode 32 after deciding to travel the globe. Rash returns during the following series. Mealing's break from the show was announced on 15 April 2019 after the actress finished filming days earlier. A show spokesperson confirmed that Connie would return in the \"autumn\", during the following series. Connie departs in the season finale at the conclusion of her story about posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction.\n\nOn 1 August 2018, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy reported that former EastEnders actor Shaheen Jafargholi had joined the cast as new nurse, Marty Kirkby. Series producer Lucy Raffety revealed on 15 August 2018 that actress Gabriella Leon would join the show alongside Jafargholi, playing student nurse Jade Lovall. Jade first appears in episode 12, originally broadcast on 3 November 2018, while Marty first appears in episode 13, originally broadcast on 17 November 2018. Raffety also announced plans to introduce new doctors during this series. Genesis Lynea and Jack Nolan were later cast as registrars Archie Hudson and Will Noble. Archie is characterised as \"bold, bolshy and extremely confident\", while Will is billed as unfazed by Archie's personality. Department troubleshooter Ciaran Coulson (Rick Warden) is introduced in episode 37 as part of the semi-regular cast. He is created as an unlikeable character and rival to Connie, who tries to improve the ED after they fail to meet targets. Raffety announced on 31 May 2019 that Jacey Sallés would join the cast as porter Rosa Cadenas during the series and feature in an \"interesting story\" with David. Rosa first appears in episode 44.\n\nThe series features several recurring characters and multiple guest stars. It was announced on 21 June 2018 that actress Sharon Gless would reprise her guest role as neurosurgeon Zsa Zsa Harper-Jenkinson in the series. Zsa Zsa appears in episode 9. In August, it was confirmed that Ellen Thomas would be playing Jacob's mother Omo Masters from September 2018. Thomas appears in episodes 6 and 8 respectively. In February 2019, it was confirmed that Thomas had reprised the role for another stint exploring Jacob's backstory, and she appears between episode 36 and 41, where the character was killed off. Episode one features the first appearance of Max Parker as Alasdair \"Base\" Newman, a drug addict who Iain befriends. Parker reappears from episode five as part of the recurring cast, and departs in episode 22 when his character is killed off. Base's drug dealer, Ross West (Chris Gordon), also appears in the series across five episodes between episode 5 and episode 22. In his final episode, Ross is revealed to be Jan's son. The same storyline also sees the reappearance of DC Kate Wilkinson (Amy Noble) in episode 22, a character who has appeared on-off since series 30.\n\nBelinda Stewart-Wilson rejoins the recurring cast as Ciara Cassidy, Dylan's alcoholic friend, in episode 2, following her appearance in the previous series. Gyuri Sarossy is later introduced as Ciara's husband, Joel Dunns, in episode 5. Both characters depart in episode 14. Accredited actor Clive Wood makes his first appearance as Duffy's \"childhood sweetheart\", Bill Crowthers, in episode 3. Dainty confirmed that Wood would feature prominently in Duffy's new storyline. Bill's daughter, Rachael Crowthers (Jennifer Hulman), was later introduced, appearing in episodes 7 and 16. Rash's childhood friend, Jamila Vani (Sujaya Dasgupta), appears between episode 7 and episode 11. Dylan's father, Brian Carroll (Matthew Marsh), appears in episode 9, having last featured in series 30. Gareth David-Lloyd appears as Jade's boss, Joshua Bowers, in episode 12. The character, billed as a \"dishy doctor\", returns from episode 15 as a love interest for Marty, but leaves in episode 20. Actor Paul Barber joined the recurring cast in episode 13 as Ernest Maxwell, a homeless man involved in a storyline with Louise. The character is killed-off in episode 23 as the storyline continues, emotionally impacting Louise. Sian Reeves reprised her role as Kim Harrison, the mother of Iain and Gem, in episode 24 and 27. Georgia Hughes joined the recurring cast as Dani Mallison in episode 27 and features in a storyline with Ruby. Harry Gilby also joined the recurring cast as Toby Williams in episode 29 and features in an ongoing story with Will. Towards the end of the series, Marty's parents, Bibi Kirkby (Badria Timimi) and Graham Kirkby (Philip Wright), were introduced as part of a story exploring Marty coming out.\n\nMain characters \n\n William Beck as Dylan Keogh\n Jason Durr as David Hide\n Jaye Griffiths as Elle Gardner\n Chelsea Halfpenny as Alicia Munroe\n Amanda Henderson as Robyn Miller\n Maddy Hill as Ruby Spark\n Shaheen Jafargholi as Marty Kirkby\n Gabriella Leon as Jade Lovall\n Genesis Lynea as Archie Hudson\n Tony Marshall as Noel Garcia\n Amanda Mealing as Connie Beauchamp\n Neet Mohan as Rash Masum\n Jack Nolan as Will Noble\n Azuka Oforka as Louise Tyler\n George Rainsford as Ethan Hardy\n Rebecca Ryan as Gemma Dean\n Charlotte Salt as Sam Nicholls\n Cathy Shipton as Lisa \"Duffy\" Duffin\n Michael Stevenson as Iain Dean\n Derek Thompson as Charlie Fairhead\n Charles Venn as Jacob Masters\n\nRecurring characters \n\n Paul Barber as Ernest Maxwell\n Di Botcher as Jan Jenning\n Gareth David-Lloyd as Joshua Bowers\n Joe Gaminara as Eddie McAllister\n Harry Gilby as Toby Williams\n Chris Gordon as Ross West\n Georgia Hughes as Dani Mallison\n Rebecca Ryan as Gemma Dean\n Max Parker as Alasdair \"Base\" Newman\n Jacey Sallés as Rosa Cadenas\n Gyuri Sarossy as Joel Dunns\n Belinda Stewart-Wilson as Ciara Cassidy\n Kai Thorne as Blake Gardner\n Rick Warden as Ciaran Coulson\n Clive Wood as Bill Crowthers\n\nGuest characters \n\n Camilla Arfwedson as Zosia Self\n Bob Barrett as Sacha Levy\n Francesca Barrett as Beka Levy\n Sujaya Dasgupta as Jamila Vani\n Sharon Gless as Zsa Zsa Harper-Jenkinson\n Marcus Griffiths as Xavier Duval\n Guy Henry as Henrik Hanssen\n Jennifer Hulman as Rachael Crowthers\n Nic Jackman as Cameron Dunn\n Jaye Jacobs as Donna Jackson\n Naomi Katiyo as Darla Johnstone\n Rosie Marcel as Jac Naylor\n Matthew Marsh as Brian Carroll\n Amy Noble as DCI Wilkinson\n Belinda Owusu as Nicky McKendrick\n Hugh Quarshie as Ric Griffin\n Sian Reeves as Kim Harrison\n Catherine Russell as Serena Campbell\n Rebecca Scroggs as Frankie Arnolds  \n Ellen Thomas as Omo Masters\n Badria Timimi as Bibi Kirkby\n Alex Walkinshaw as Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher\n Kaye Wragg as Essie Di Lucca\n Philip Wright as Graham Kirkby\n\nProduction \nThe thirty-third series will consist of 47 episodes. Lucy Raffety continues her role as series producer while Simon Harper remains as the executive producer. Kate Oates became the show's senior executive producer from October 2018, and was promoted to Head of Continuing Drama six months later. Raffety's resignation from her position was announced on 16 April 2019. Raffety confirmed that there would be a series 33 in an interview with TVTimes, where she billed the series as the \"Year of the Paramedic\". In preparation for the series, two new paramedic characters were introduced to the drama.\n\nIt was announced on 24 July 2018 that the series would begin on 11 August 2018 with an episode described as \"one of [the] biggest episodes in the show's history.\" It was previously revealed, in May 2018, that the show was filming scenes which would feature a motorway crash and a petrol tanker turning on its side. Sophie Dainty of entertainment website Digital Spy reported that there would be an explosion, which would leave one main character's life \"hanging in the balance\". An official statement from the show stated that the ED's paramedic crew would \"face their darkest day\" in the episode. Charlotte Salt, who portrays Sam Nicholls, told Elaine Reilly of What's on TV that the episodes were filmed at night over two weeks with night shoots lasting over 13 hours. On the atmosphere on-set while filming, she commented, \"there's a certain buzz in the air...\" The episode sees Sam die after suffering a fatal bleed from the crash, which sparks a new story for Iain as he struggles to cope with his grief. A show trailer, released on 12 August, teased \"a new era\" for the hospital following Sam's death. The trailer previewed Iain's guilt, the appearances of Zsa Zsa and Omo, Eddie facing trial for Alicia's rape, and upsetting scenes for Charlie and Duffy. On 16 November 2018, it was revealed via Casualty official Instagram page that the show would be receiving a new set of titles. The revamp came into effect from episode 13, which aired on 17 November 2018, replacing the show's former titles, which were introduced back in series 31.\n\nCrossovers \nThis series features crossover events with Holby City sister show Casualty. In August 2018, Raffety told Dainty (Digital Spy) that Harper enjoys the crossover events between the two dramas and wanted to produce more. She also teased some \"extremely exciting crossovers\" within the series. In a December 2018 interview with Dainty, Harper promised further crossovers between Holby City and Casualty, and teased an \"exciting\" event to be aired in spring 2019. Holby City cast member Alex Walkinshaw (Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher), who appeared in Casualty between 2012 and 2014, makes a crossover appearance in episode 31.\n\nOn 15 February 2019, it was announced that Casualty would crossover with spin-off series Holby City for two episodes, billed as \"CasualtyXHolby\", in March as part of the year-long twentieth anniversary celebrations for Holby City. The episodes are billed as \"dramatic [and] action-packed\". Both episodes were written by Michelle Lipton and directed by Steve Brett. The episodes see the hospital attacked by a cyber-virus, destroying all electric systems. A predominant story in the episodes follows Connie and Holby City character Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) saving the lives of colleagues after two separate major incidents, despite only having one available theatre.

The series follows the life of a seemingly unconnected group of people living in London, whose lives are strangely affected by the murder of a young woman in the city. While some of the group are able to take a newfound hope from the remains of the tragic event, others including food critic Gary Rickey (Phil Daniels) simply watch on as despair begins to unravel in the light of the aftermath. Proving popular with both critics and viewers alike, the series won a Royal Television Society award for Best Drama Serial in 1998. The series boasted a stellar cast, including David Morrissey, \n\n Bradley's first work for television was the episode \"Force of Nature\" for ITV’s The Vice in 2001, a series for which he contributed two more episodes (2002-2003).

This serial marked the debut of Louise Jameson as companion Leela. It was also the first of three stories written for the series by Chris Boucher and the first of five directed by Pennant Roberts. In the serial, the powerful split-personality computer Xoanon (played by Tom Baker, Rob Edwards, Pamela Salem, Anthony Frieze, and Roy Herrick) attempts to create two super races from the descendants of a human expedition with eugenics—the savage Sevateem, and the psychic Tesh. The Fourth Doctor (Baker) seeks to repair this personality fault. The serial is generally well-received by reviewers, although Doctor Who fans consider it to be overshadowed by other stories in Season 14. It did, however, gain high ratings, with three episodes achieving over 11 million viewers on first screening.\n\nQuestion: how many episodes of touching evil are there\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When they arrived there, they were joined by mobs from the city and sepoys from regiments stationed near Delhi. They captured the city on 11 May 1857, killing British officers and civilians. They proclaimed themselves to be at the disposal of the Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah II, who reluctantly gave his support to the rebellion.

This offended both Muslim soldiers, who did not eat pork and Hindu soldiers, who did not eat beef. The uprising spread rapidly in the surrounding areas of Delhi against the British. With the outbreak of the mutiny in Bareilly, Subhedar Bahadur Khan had been acclaimed as general by the sepoys involved. When Bakht Khan heard of the rebellion in Meerut, he decided to march to Delhi to support the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar's army.

An uprising in several sepoy companies of the Bengal army was sparked by the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle in February 1857. Loading the Enfield often required tearing open the greased cartridge with one's teeth, and many sepoys believed that the cartridges were greased with cow and pig fat. This would have insulted both Hindu and Muslim religious practices; cows were considered holy by Hindus, while pigs were considered unclean (Haram) by Muslims.

The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mile northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.

The song was a number one hit on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts published by RPM, reaching its peak on both charts for the week of December 31, 1977. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: \"Lady\" in 1980 and \"You Were a Good Friend\" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor. Her version was also released as a single, reaching number 36 on the country music charts. At the time, it was her lowest-peaking single since \"(I Still Long to Hold You) Now and Then\" in 1980.

It's a breezy retro ballad wherein the singer follows the girl he's in love with all the way to Saskatoon, Canada, where he ultimately finds her and weds her. And, despite the cold temperatures, he \"found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon.\" An interesting side note is that while performing in Saskatoon in 1961, Cash selected a girl from the audience named Alexandra Wiwcharuk to sing the song to. She was a local beauty queen who dreamed of becoming a stewardess. Tragically, a few months later, the young woman was found murdered on the banks of the [South] Saskatchewan River. The story goes that once Cash heard this news he never sang the song again.\"\n\n 2002, she ranked no.4 in CMT's 40 Greatest Women of Country Music.

As she sewed, she told her child the biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors. The excited child, \"with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes,\" rushed to school, \"just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\" for wearing a coat made of rags. \"Traveling Man\" involves an unusual love triangle between a traveling salesman, a woman, and her mother.

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story.\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\n\nPlot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone.

Canoness Hroswitha, in her manuscript Maria, uses the word Dominatrix for the main character. She is portrayed as an unattainable woman who is too good for any of the men who are in love with her. The theme of \"the unattainable woman\" has been used thoroughly in medieval literature as well, although it differs from a dominatrix. Medieval themes surrounding the unattainable woman concerned issues of social classes and structure, with chivalry being a prime part of a relationship between a man and woman. There are some exceptions to this trend during medieval times. In Cervantes’ Don Quixote (1605), Celadon is imprisoned by Galatea. Celadon complains that his “mistress. . .

The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn). The intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the \n\n The 2000 U.S. census counted 108,839 residents in the 2.72-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 38,214 people per square mile, the second-highest density of any community in Los Angeles County, after Koreatown. In 2008 the city estimated that the population had increased to 117,756. It was estimated in 1993 that 85,000 people lived within a mile of the Alvarado/MacArthur Park Red Line station and that the density of this neighborhood rivaled that of Manhattan in New York City.

Tim Connolly, the Vikings team president at the time, recalled that Shanahan insinuated relief that the Broncos were not playing the Vikings when the two met at a reception after the conference championship games. Two weeks later in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, \"These last three years have \n\n Pearson in the game's final seconds, a play in which Vikings observers claim that Pearson should have been penalized for pass interference. The Vikings also lost to the Washington Redskins in the 1987 NFC Championship Game, during which Vikings running back Darrin Nelson dropped a game-tying touchdown pass in the game's final seconds. Due to this history of misfortune, the NFL Network ranked the Vikings as the second most \"snake-bitten\" franchise of all-time, behind only the Cleveland Browns. Under head coach Dennis Green, the Vikings were perennial playoff contenders throughout the 1990s, but they experienced little success once they reached the \n\n time since 2009. Three Vikings scored eight touchdowns: running back Latavius Murray, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, and tight end Kyle Rudolph. Since the Vikings were the #2 seed in the NFC, they did not have to play during the NFL's Wild Card Weekend. The Viking's #2 seeding meant that U.S. Bank Stadium became the first Super Bowl host stadium (selected on May 20, 2014) to also host a Divisional Playoff Game in the same season; all previous times that the Super Bowl host stadium also hosted another postseason game that season were Wild Card Playoffs. Despite an 0–2 start to 2017, New Orleans finished with an 11–5 record, thereby winning the NFC South and qualifying for the playoffs as the \n\n The 2009 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 49th in the National Football League and their fourth under head coach Brad Childress. The Vikings improved upon their 10–6 record and defended their NFC North title from 2008, their first successful defense of a divisional title since they won six NFC Central titles in a row between 1973 and 1978. They beat the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Divisional Playoff at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, but lost the NFC Championship Game in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints, missing out on what would have been their first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XI in 1976. This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the \"Bountygate Game\" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season.\n\n Before the 1998 NFL season, the Minnesota Vikings had accumulated a history of disappointing losses despite maintaining a high level of competition. Although they were the first franchise to appear in four Super Bowls, they lost each time and became the first franchise to lose four Super Bowls as a result. They had not appeared in a Super Bowl since their fourth loss following the 1976 season, although they had come close in other seasons.

There is little evidence of microbe activity in older (more than 10 million year old) crust. Near subduction zones, volcanoes can form in island arcs and back-arc regions. The subducting plate releases volatiles and solutes to these volcanoes, resulting in acidic fluids with higher concentrations of gases and metals than in the mid-ocean ridge. It also releases water that can mix with mantle material to form serpentinite. When hotspot volcanoes occur in the middle of oceanic plates, they create permeable and porous basalts with higher concentrations of gas than at mid-ocean ridges. Hydrothermal fluids are cooler and have a lower sulfide content. Iron-oxidizing bacteria create extensive deposits of iron oxides.\n\n Oceanic detachment faults occur at spreading ridges where magmatic activity is not enough to account for the entire plate spreading rate. They are characterized by long domes parallel to the spreading direction (oceanic core complexes of the footwall). Slip on these faults can range from tens to hundreds of km. They cannot be structurally restored, as slip on the fault exceeds the thickness of oceanic crust (~30 km compared to ~6 km, for example). While occurring at relatively amagmatic spreading centres, the footwalls of these detachment faults are much more influenced by magmatism than in continental settings. In fact, they are often created by ‘continuous casting’: new footwall is continually being generated by mantle or melt from a magma chamber as slip occurs on the fault. The lithology is dominated by gabbro and peridotite, resulting in a mineralogy of olivine, serpentine, talc and plagioclase. This is in contrast to continental settings, where the mineralogy is dominantly quartz and feldspar. The footwall is also much more extensively hydrothermally altered than in continental settings. In contrast to many detachment faults in continental settings, oceanic detachment faults are usually rolling hinge normal faults, initiating at higher angles and rotating to low angles.\n\n Ocean crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and is removed by subduction. The top half kilometer or so is a series of basaltic flows, and only this layer has enough porosity and permeability to allow fluid flow. Less suitable for life are the layers of sheeted dikes and gabbros underneath. Mid-ocean ridges are a hot, rapidly changing environment with a steep vertical temperature gradient, so life can only exist in the top few meters. High-temperature interactions between water and rock reduce sulfates, producing abundant sulfides that serve as energy sources; they also strip the rock of metals that can be sources of energy or toxic. Along with degassing from magma, water interactions also produce a \n\n Geologic tension is also found in the tectonic regions of divergent boundaries. Here, a magma chamber forms underneath oceanic crust and causes sea-floor spreading in the creation of new oceanic crust. Some of the force that pushes the two plates apart is due to ridge push force of the magma chamber. Tension, however, accounts for most of the \"opposite directions\" pull on the plates. As the separating oceanic crust cools over time, it becomes more dense and sinks farther and farther away from the ridge axis. The cooling and sinking ocean crust causes a tensile stress that also helps drive the pulling apart of the plates at the ridge axis.\n\n Mid-ocean ridges exhibit active volcanism and seismicity. The oceanic crust is in a constant state of 'renewal' at the mid-ocean ridges by the processes of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. New magma steadily emerges onto the ocean floor and intrudes into the existing ocean crust at and near rifts along the ridge axes. The rocks making up the crust below the seafloor are youngest along the axis of the ridge and age with increasing distance from that axis. New magma of basalt composition emerges at and near the axis because of decompression melting in the underlying Earth's mantle. The isentropic upwelling solid mantle material exceeds the solidus temperature and melts. The crystallized magma forms a new crust of basalt known as MORB for mid-ocean ridge basalt, and gabbro below it in the lower oceanic crust. Mid-ocean ridge basalt is a tholeiitic \n\nQuestion: where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lisp machines (1970s and 1980s) were a well-known and influential group of HLLCAs. Intel iAPX 432 (1981) was designed to support Ada. This was Intel's first 32-bit processor design, and was intended to be Intel's main processor family for the 1980s, but failed commercially. Rekursiv (mid-1980s) was a minor system, designed to support object-oriented programming and the Lingo programming language in hardware, and supported recursion at the instruction set level, hence the name. A number of processors and coprocessors intended to implement Prolog more directly were designed in the late 1980s and early \n\n The first operating systems for the GEC 4000 series were COS (Core Operating System) and DOS (Disk Operating System). These were basically single-user multi-tasking operating systems, designed for developing and running Process control type applications. OS4000 was first released around 1977. It reused many of the parts of DOS, but added multi-user access, OS4000 JCL Command-line interpreter, Batch processing, OS4000 hierarchical filesystem (although on-disk format very similar to the non-hierarchical DOS filesystem). OS4000 JCL was based on the Cambridge University Phoenix command interpreter. OS4000 Rel 3 arrived around 1980, and included Linked-OS — support for Linked OS4000 operating systems to enable multi-node systems to be constructed. The main customer for this was the central computing service of University College London (Euclid), where a multi-node system consisting of a Hub file server and multiple Rim multi-access compute server systems provided service for over \n\n dissertation to the Harvard library, a requirement for the degree. In 2020, the Computer History museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost dissertation. During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested the name \"Unix\", a pun on the name \"Multics\". To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B. Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and \n\n one year later in 1970. Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), a time-sharing operating system project, involved MIT, Bell Labs, General Electric (later Honeywell) and was led by Fernando Corbató from MIT. Multics was written in the PL/I language developed by IBM and IBM User Group. IBM's goal was to satisfy business, scientific, and systems programming requirements. There were other languages that could have been considered but PL/I offered the most complete solution even though it had not been implemented. For the first few years of the Multics project, a subset of the language could be compiled to assembly language \n\n The Burroughs Large Systems (1961) were the first HLLCA, designed to support ALGOL (1959), one of the earliest HLLs. This was referred to at the time as \"language-directed design.\" The Burroughs Medium Systems (1966) were designed to support COBOL for business applications. The Burroughs Small Systems (mid-1970s, designed from late 1960s) were designed to support multiple HLLs by a writable control store. These were all mainframes. The Wang 2200 (1973) series were designed with a BASIC interpreter in micro-code.

Active asset management comes at a higher price to investors because more work is involved. Passive asset management: assets are allocated to mirror a market or a sector index. Unlike active asset management, passive asset management is a lot less laborious. It is also less tailored, requires less looking after and consequently is cheaper for investors. The most common usage of the term \"asset manager\" refers to investment management, the sector of the financial services industry that manages investment funds and segregated client accounts. Asset management is part of a financial company that employs experts who manage money and handle the investments of clients. This is done either actively or passively.  \n\nBusiness planning plays a crucial role in monitoring global health budgets in Turkmenistan and contributes to financial control and sound management in the healthcare system. In Turkmenistan, prospective business plans are used to link planned objectives and activities with financial allocations, providing a framework for setting and monitoring budget expenditure. These business plans can be aligned with the overall objectives of the healthcare system restructuring and ensure sound financial management.\n\nThe process of business planning in the healthcare system brings about a significant change in how health facilities examine their activities. It serves as a tool to increase awareness of management issues and allows for a rigorous, bottom-up planning of financial resources. By integrating financial considerations into the planning process, business planning helps healthcare facilities identify priorities, allocate resources efficiently, and ensure transparency and accountability in budget management.\n\nMoreover, business plans in Turkmenistan's healthcare system enable the monitoring of budget expenditure. Through regular tracking and evaluation of financial allocations, healthcare providers can assess their spending against the planned objectives and activities. This monitoring helps identify potential deviations, inefficiencies, or areas where financial control may be lacking. By closely monitoring budget expenditure, business planning facilitates early intervention, corrective measures, and better overall financial control.\n\nAdditionally, business planning allows for better financial management in the healthcare system. It helps healthcare facilities establish realistic budgets based on their objectives and activities, taking into account the available financial resources. This results in improved financial decision-making, resource allocation, and overall management efficiency. With a structured business planning approach, financial stability and sustainability can be achieved, ensuring that the healthcare system operates within its means and remains financially viable.\n\nIn summary, business planning plays a pivotal role in monitoring global health budgets in Turkmenistan. It contributes to financial control and sound management in the healthcare system by linking planned objectives and activities with financial allocations, facilitating budget expenditure monitoring, and enabling better financial management. Through business planning, healthcare facilities can prioritize resources, enhance financial transparency, and ensure the efficient and effective use of financial resources in achieving healthcare goals.\n\n and related activities. Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information, including the preparation of financial statements, to the external users of the information, such as investors, regulators and suppliers; and management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information for internal use by management. The recording of financial transactions, so that summaries of the financials may be presented in financial reports, is known as bookkeeping, of which double-entry bookkeeping is the most common system. Accounting has existed in various forms and levels of sophistication throughout human history. The double-entry accounting system in use today \n\nIn the field of medicine, various methods are employed in management to ensure effective healthcare delivery. These methods encompass a range of approaches that are used to plan, organize, and control medical resources and activities. The key methods employed in management include strategic planning, quality improvement initiatives, financial management, and performance evaluation.\n\nStrategic planning is a method used to set long-term goals and develop strategies to achieve them. It involves analyzing the current healthcare environment, identifying areas of improvement, and creating an action plan to address those issues. This method helps healthcare organizations align their activities with their overall mission and vision, ensuring that resources and efforts are directed towards the most important objectives.\n\nQuality improvement initiatives are another crucial method in healthcare management. These approaches aim to enhance the quality of patient care by identifying and implementing evidence-based practices. Quality improvement involves monitoring patient outcomes, gathering data, analyzing performance, and implementing changes to improve processes and systems. By constantly striving for improvement, healthcare organizations can provide safer and more effective care to patients.\n\nFinancial management is an essential aspect of healthcare management. This method involves overseeing the financial resources of healthcare organizations, including budgeting, cost control, and revenue generation. Financial management ensures that healthcare organizations can sustain their operations, invest in necessary resources, and provide cost-effective care. It also involves managing reimbursement systems, negotiating contracts with insurance providers, and addressing financial challenges.\n\nPerformance evaluation is a method used to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare delivery. It involves measuring and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the quality of care, patient satisfaction, and productivity of healthcare providers. Performance evaluation enables healthcare organizations to identify areas for improvement, recognize successful practices, and make informed decisions on resource allocation and process optimization.\n\nIn summary, the management of healthcare involves various methods such as strategic planning, quality improvement initiatives, financial management, and performance evaluation. These methods aim to optimize healthcare delivery, enhance patient outcomes, and ensure the efficient use of resources. By employing these approaches, healthcare organizations can continuously improve their operations and provide high-quality care to patients.\n\nA money manager plays a crucial role in the financial management of healthcare facilities by overseeing the investment of various funds such as endowment, corporate surplus, pension, or deferred compensation funds. Their expertise in financial management allows them to select investments that align with the organization's specific goals and needs. They monitor the performance of the investment portfolio and make adjustments to the mix of securities, bonds, and other assets when necessary.\n\nBy working towards producing an above-average return on investments, a money manager aims to optimize the financial resources of the healthcare facility. Even a small improvement in average performance can have a significant impact on the overall contribution costs or benefits of the organization.\n\nThe expertise of a money manager benefits the organization's investment portfolio in several ways. Firstly, they bring specialized knowledge and experience in investment strategies and financial markets, allowing them to make informed decisions. This helps in diversifying the portfolio and managing risk effectively.\n\nSecondly, money managers stay updated with market trends, economic conditions, and industry developments, enabling them to identify potential investment opportunities and take advantage of favorable market conditions.\n\nAdditionally, money managers provide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the investment portfolio's performance. They keep track of market fluctuations, analyze the portfolio's returns, and recommend adjustments to ensure that the funds remain on track to meet the organization's financial objectives.\n\nOverall, the role of a money manager is vital in maximizing the returns on investments for healthcare facilities. Their expertise and diligent management of funds contribute to improving financial stability, optimizing resources, and achieving the organization's long-term financial goals.\n\nQuestion: what is the ultimate objective of financial management\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These estimates depart from the findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years. Orcas are one of the few species to exhibit menopause and Granny's great age gave her a chance to use her skills to enhance the reproductive success of her offspring (see Grandmother hypothesis).\n\n or predation. The maximum life span of most species is documented in the Anage repository. Maximum life span is usually longer for species that are larger or have effective defenses against predation, such as bird flight, chemical defenses or living in social groups. The differences in life span between species demonstrate the role of genetics in determining maximum life span (\"rate of aging\").

This embosses the numeric amount through the paper of the check form, strongly discouraging any attempt to alter or raise this amount. Because physical check writers and ribbon writers are now considered antique, businesses that still need this check protection technology such as a business, or organization which regularly prepares remittances by issuing high-amount checks can use a physical check writing device. Financial institutions regularly use them to prepare cashier's checks, and they are also used by issuers of money orders such as the United States Postal Service. Newer versions are electronic, but many are still made by Paymaster.\n\n Cashier balancing is a process usually conducted in businesses such as grocery stores, restaurants and banks that takes place at the closing of the business day or at the end of a cashier's shift. This balancing process makes the cashier responsible for the money in his or her cash register.\n\n A person who physically writes a check or cheque. The check writer is also known as the \"payor\", \"signer\", \"maker\", the drawer, or the \"account holder\". The signer or presenter of the check, or person who prints and authorizes the check. In U.S. law, in Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in most U.S. State statutes, a check is an order (as opposed to a promise) to pay a fixed amount of money, according to §3-104(a). §3-104(f) specifies that '''\"Check\" means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank; or (ii) a cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as 'money order.' Such an order is issued by the drawer. §3-103(a)(3) specifies that \"Drawer\" means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment.\n\n In order to balance (or settle) the cash drawer, first, the manager (or sometimes the cashier) prepares to count the money in the register. Counting the money is usually done in the back office: the drawer is removed from the register and taken into the office. By preparing to count the money, all large bills, checks and coupons and food stamps (if any) are removed and put to the side. Next, the person counting the money counts it back to its \"starting amount.\" The starting amount is the amount of money that was in the drawer at the beginning of the shift. As this is being done, there will be additional bills and change that will be put off to the side along with the larger bills. Once the drawer is reset back to its starting amount for the next cashier's shift, it is either placed in the safe or given to another cashier that is starting their shift.\n\n Now, the bills and change that were put off to the side get counted, along with the checks from the cashier's drawer. This is what makes up the cashier's sales deposit. Most cash registers can print up a sales slip and money tendering slip that tells how much money the cashier made in sales and how much money the cashier is accounted for. The manager refers to this slip when counting the cashier's sales money. If the money counted does not match what is on the balancing slip, the cashier may be over or short (in cash). Whenever a discrepancy such as overages or shortages occur, the money is usually counted again to ensure that the amount is correct.

Wonderwall Music, a soundtrack to the 1968 film Wonderwall, blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer. Released in November 1968, Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records. Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage \"Dream Scene\", recorded several months before Lennon's \"Revolution 9\". In December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. During the tour that included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, Harrison began to play slide guitar, and also began to write \"My Sweet Lord\", which became his first single as a solo artist.\n\n Ono were on holiday in Denmark at the time. The group recorded 16 takes of the basic track, with Harrison on acoustic guitar and singing a guide vocal, McCartney on bass guitar, and Starr playing drums. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn describes the session as an efficient one in which the bandmates indulged in an instrumental jam after take 6 and also played a \"delightful\" cover of Buddy Holly's \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", sung by Harrison before beginning take 12. At the start of take 15, Harrison delivered a mock press statement in which he made a joking reference to Lennon's absence by recasting the four Beatles \n\n on the song finished the next day, with Harrison playing a lead guitar solo with a Gibson Les Paul during the song's coda.

He also suggests that, because McCartney's bass hits on the \"me\" of Lennon's line \"Shoot me!\", only \"Shoot\" is easily audible on the finished recording.

In 1966, Delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant Governor. The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi. A system was introduced under which the elected government was given wide powers, excluding law and order which remained with the Central Government. The actual enforcement of the legislation came in 1993. The first major extension of New Delhi outside of Lutyens' Delhi came in the 1950s when the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) developed a large area of land southwest of Lutyens' Delhi to create the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri, where land was allotted for embassies, chanceries, high commissions and residences of ambassadors, around a wide central vista, Shanti Path.\n\n several union territories ('centrally administered province').

About 30 minutes after the accident, physician Edward H. Williams found Gage sitting in a chair outside the hotel and was greeted with \"one of the great understatements of medical history\": \"When I drove up he said, \"Doctor, here is business enough for you.\" I first noticed the wound upon the head before I alighted from my carriage, the pulsations \n\nIn the second year of training for my mental health nursing degree I spent a day with the ambulance service.\nFrom a road traffic accident to a fire and a cardiac arrest, I witnessed the variety of work undertaken daily by paramedics, and the complex range of skills required to do the job.\nI was in a rapid response vehicle with a female paramedic, who I will call Sarah, and our first task was to ensure all our medical equipment and medicines were on board.\nThe vehicle is prepared by the night crew, but as paramedics have the same level of clinical accountability as nurses, it was vital to double-check everything – if anything went wrong due to missing or faulty equipment the paramedic would be accountable.\nThe traffic accident was our first call. A man on his way to work had been hit by a car on a busy main road and his head had struck the windscreen. His head was bleeding and he looked shocked, but he was fully conscious and breathing.\nSarah took his physical observations and asked him what had happened, whether he was in pain and where, and what medications he was taking. She also asked about his next of kin and if he had any health conditions.\nAfter she had dressed his head wound the man was strapped to a spinal board so as not to exacerbate any musculoskeletal injuries he might have sustained. He seemed in good spirits, all things considered, and even cracked jokes about getting a day off work.\nWe took him to hospital and I observed the transfer of care to staff in the emergency department. Sarah gave a handover to the nurse in charge and completed the patient report form that is required after each incident.\nWhile waiting for our next call to come through, Sarah and I discussed her practice. From delivering babies to attending scenes where someone has died, she responds to a wide range of incidents, some of which require a great deal of emotional resilience.\nShe said although there was a need to be emotionally strong to do the job and cope with what was encountered on a day-to-day basis, there had been incidents that had upset her.\nTalking to colleagues and having impromptu counselling sessions in the mess room of the ambulance station helped her to cope. But she said incidents can affect people in different ways, and it is important to have your own coping mechanisms.\nOur next call was a suspected cardiac arrest, so Sarah put the blue lights and siren on and drove fast. When we arrived at the house it was messy and squalid, with empty beer cans everywhere.\nA distraught woman told us her relative was upstairs and that she and a neighbour had tried to perform CPR, but she thought it was too late.\nWe went upstairs and found a man’s body on the floor, but it was only when Sarah started examining him that I realised he was dead. I had never seen a dead body before, so this was quite a shock.\nThe man, who was alcohol-dependent and had cirrhosis of the liver, was known to the service. We covered his body with a duvet but his dog, who would not leave him, kept pulling it aside. The relative was concerned for the man’s partner, who was not at home.\nThis experience had a profound effect on me, and I became upset by the situation. I felt sad for the man’s family and offered them my sympathies.\nSarah then explained how paramedics make a diagnosis of death. She showed me rigor mortis – the patient’s jaw was stiff and would not open – and hypostasis, the pooling of fluids to the lowest points on the body, which creates areas of dark red discolouration.\nAfter completing the diagnosis of death form she contacted emergency services control to check when the police would arrive. While we waited, I tried to help the man’s relative. She was shocked and hadn’t realised the extent of his problems.\nAll this happened before lunchtime, showing just how intense and varied the life of a paramedic can be. In the afternoon we were called to a GP surgery to take a patient with suspected atrial fibrillation to hospital, attended a minor kitchen fire in a block of flats and saw a patient with multiple sclerosis who said she was in pain.\nThis was an interesting case for me as the patient, who had multiple health conditions, made contradictory statements that didn’t seem to add up and it was unclear what was going on.\nHer physical observations were all within normal range, but she talked about some recent stressful events that were affecting her. Sarah thought the patient’s presentation and body language did not indicate she was in great pain, so she suggested the patient talk to the mental health liaison team in the emergency department, and she agreed to come with us to the hospital.\nReflecting on this, Sarah said it was possible the patient was withdrawing from opiates and was engaging in ‘seeking behaviours’ – trying to get morphine from the ambulance or hospital staff – which Sarah had seen before.\nParamedics are on the front line of emergency care. My day shadowing Sarah highlighted the complex range of skills required to manage the response to an emergency call, and the emotional side of the work.\nAlthough nursing and paramedicine are different disciplines they have skills, values and knowledge in common. Working with Sarah was a great way to see assessment skills in action, and how paramedics use observation, intuition and judgement to make decisions.\nObserving the different situations paramedics face on a daily basis also enabled me to appreciate the wider social context of mental and physical healthcare, and I learned a lot from this experience that will enhance my development as a mental health nurse.\nWith thanks to my personal tutor Elizabeth Collier for her help and advice on writing this reflective article, and for her support and encouragement in getting it published.\n\nQuestion: when does nathan get in a car accident\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In addition, HFC-125 leaves no residue on valuable equipment and material after discharge. It is generally used in situations where water from a fire sprinkler would damage expensive equipment, or where water-based fire protection is impractical, such as museums, banks, clean rooms and hospitals. The HFC-125 clean agent is stored in a pressurized container and introduced into the hazard as a gas. The agent is odorless, colorless, electrically non-conductive, non-corrosive, and leaves no residue. It is used in occupied enclosed areas that contain high-value assets. HFC-125 suppresses fire by absorbing heat energy at its molecular level faster than the heat can be generated, so the fire cannot sustain itself. It also forms free radicals to chemically interfere with the chain reaction of the combustion process. This makes it a highly effective fire fighting agent that is safe for people and causes no damage to equipment. HFC-125 is considered a Clean Agent and is therefore included in the National Fire Protection Association's 2001 - Standard for Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems.\n\n injected into the fuel tanks for one-time use. Due to environmental concerns, trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is being considered as an alternative. Halon 1211 is typically used in hand-held extinguishers, in which a stream of liquid halon is directed at a smaller fire by a user. The stream evaporates under reduced pressure, producing strong local cooling, as well as a high concentration of halon in the immediate vicinity of the fire. In this mode, fire is extinguished by cooling and oxygen deprivation at the core of the fire, as well as radical quenching over a larger area. After fire suppression, the halon diffuses, leaving no residue.\n\n Potassium acetate is the extinguishing agent used in Class K fire extinguishers because of its ability to cool and form a crust over burning oils.\n\n  At high temperatures, halons decompose to release halogen atoms that combine readily with active hydrogen atoms, quenching flame propagation reactions even when adequate fuel, oxygen, and heat remain. The chemical reaction in a flame proceeds as a free radical chain reaction; by sequestering the radicals which propagate the reaction, halons are able to halt the fire at much lower concentrations than are required by fire suppressants using the more traditional methods of cooling, oxygen deprivation, or fuel dilution. For example, Halon 1301 total flooding systems are typically used at concentrations no higher than 7% by volume in air, and can suppress many fires at 2.9% \n\n Flexible suction hose, also known as a suction hose, is a specific type of rigid fire hose used in drafting operations. When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an unpressurized supply, such as a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant. Under complete vacuum conditions, a pump would lift water 33.9 ft, however pumps on fire apparatus are not capable of producing a perfect/ total vacuum.

This a keyboard-only game, and uses a set of commands (called \"Merphish\" in-game) such as the standard north, south, east and west (N,S,E,W) and some additional unique commands such as invoke (I), freeze (f), and blast (b) which cast spells. Conversations with certain friendly characters such as Apex the Ogre are initiated in the following syntax: \"[character],[speech]\" e.g. \"Apex, thanks\". The dungeons are full of dangerous and hostile creatures such as wyverns, goblins and vampires. Axil can defend himself using magic to stall or kill these creatures. Not everyone in the dungeon is an enemy, some inhabitants (such as Apex the Ogre) are friendly unless provoked and can be conversed with. The dungeon itself is separated into several distinct levels which Axil can travel to and from at will provided he can find the staircases up or down.

The PlayStation version features the ability to \"empower\" weapons and armor by purchasing elemental-, essence- and aether- based talismans and runes, attuning each to different properties - respectively Fire, Earth, Water, Air; Spirit, Mind, Body; and Light and Dark. Every individual character in the game is based upon one of these nine properties, and use of separate runes and talismans allows the player to defeat certain foes more easily. In addition, the PlayStation version contains a New Game Plus feature.

The gameplay revolves around cover-based shooting mechanics and features a variety of weapons. The player progresses through the story by journeying through linear paths, defeating enemies and traversing obstacles. Quick time events and melee takedowns are also implemented and several collectibles are scattered around the environment. The Order: 1886 received mixed reviews from critics. Praise was particularly directed at the game's production value, graphics, and technical achievements, while most criticisms were concerning the length, story, gameplay, replay value, and the overall amount of involvement the player is given.\n\n released in Europe. In the game, the player controls a youth named Benjamin in his quest to save the world. His goal is to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine the state of the world's four elemental powers.

Below the High Courts are a hierarchy of subordinate courts, such as the civil courts, family courts, criminal courts, and various other district courts. High courts were instituted as constitutional courts under Part VI, Chapter V, Article 214 of the Constitution of India. The High Courts are the principal civil courts of original jurisdiction in the state (along with the subordinate District Courts). However, High Courts exercise their original civil and criminal jurisdiction only if \n\n of the High Courts and Supreme Court are appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of a collegium. The Judicial system of India is classified into three levels with subsidiary parts. The Supreme Court, also known as the Apex Court, is the top court and the last appellate court in India. The Chief Justice of India is its top authority. High Courts are the top judicial bodies in the states, controlled and managed by Chief Justices of States. Below the High Courts are District Courts, also known as subordinate courts, that are controlled and managed by the \n\n judge. He is known as district judge when he presides over a civil case, and session's judge when he presides over a criminal case. He is the highest judicial authority below a high court judge. Below him, there are courts of civil jurisdiction, known by different names in different states. Under Article 141 of the constitution, all courts in India — including high courts — are bounded by the judgments and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence. Judges in a high court are appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state. High courts are headed by a chief justice. The chief justices rank fourteenth (within their \n\n Constitution bench is the name given to the benches of the Supreme Court of India which consist of at least five judges of the court which sit to decide any case “involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation” of the Constitution of India or \"for the purpose of hearing any reference\" made by the President of India under Article 143. This provision has been mandated by Article 145 (3) of the Constitution of India. The Chief Justice of India has the power to constitute a Constitution Bench and refer cases to it. Constitution benches have decided many of India's best-known and most important Supreme Court cases, such as A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (basic structure doctrine) and Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (OBC reservations) etc.\n\n a case involves a serious issue that needs immediate resolution. It had its inaugural sitting on 26 January 1950, the day India's constitution came into force, and has since delivered more than 24,000 reported judgements. The Supreme Court comprises the Chief Justice and 33 other judges. The proceedings of the Supreme Court are conducted in English only. The Supreme Court Rules of 1966 were framed under Article 145 of the Constitution, which exists to regulate the practices and procedures of the Supreme Court. Article 145 has been amended and is presently governed by the Supreme Court Rules of 2013.\n\nQuestion: total strength of judges in supreme court of india\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was released in August 1997 as the third single from McGraw's fourth studio album Everywhere. Having spent 42 weeks on the Billboard chart, it set what was then a record for being the longest-running single on the Billboard country chart since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990. It was also the longest chart run for any country single in the 1990s. The song was also released by Mitchell Tenpenny in 2018.\n\n the sweetest place and the only right place for me is turning back and falling into the arms of a loving God.\"\" In another interview with Billboard, he told about the story of the song and how it was put together: \"\"['I Just Need U'] started in a session writing for the band Finding Favour, but they said it wasn't for them. I thought about [it] and began plowing through my feelings. The world tricks us into thinking certain things will fulfill us, [but] time and again I end up hungry. But when I look to my faith, I begin to find a permanent fulfillment. There's depth and there's soul, which is what you would expect from a seasoned artist.\"\"\n\n \"Whenever You Need Me\" is a song by British band T'Pau, released as the lead single from their 1991 third studio album The Promise. It was written by Carol Decker and Ron Rogers, and produced by Andy Richards. \"Whenever You Need Me\" reached No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart and remained in the charts for six weeks. It was the band's last Top 40 hit in the UK. The 7\" single's B-side, \"All the Love\", was a non-album track exclusive to the single. In the UK, a limited edition box-set of the single was issued, featuring the 12\" vinyl single and a life-size colour poster of Decker. A music video was filmed to promote the single. The band also performed the song on the UK music show Top of the Pops, and the UK Saturday morning children show Gimme 5.\n\n I Need Your Lovin' (also: \"Need Your Lovin'\") is a popular rhythm and blues song written by Bobby Robinson and Don Gardner. Gardner, teamed up with singer Dee Dee Ford and scored a Top 20 hit with the song in 1962. The song was unusual at the time in that it was a 5:45 two-part composition, but it was Part 2 that got the airplay. The song also featured a full false ending during the second half, coming to a complete stop and then starting up again, much in the manner of African American gospel music of the era, in which the singer who surged beyond the \"ending\" of the song implied that the Holy Spirit is so strong that it cannot be stopped by mere musical convention. \"I Need Your Lovin'\" has been covered by many artists including Otis Redding, on his debut 1964 album Pain in My Heart; and Tom Jones (the latter on his Along Came Jones, 1965 debut album).\n\n \"All I Ever Need Is You\" is a popular song written by Jimmy Holiday and Eddie Reeves, and initially recorded by Ray Charles for his 1971 album, Volcanic Action of My Soul. The most well-known version of the song is the hit single by Sonny & Cher which, in 1971, reached No. 7 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was their single of greatest chart longevity, spending 15 weeks on that chart.

Dental fluorosis is characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. It appears as different visual changes in enamel, ranging from small, opaque, \"paper white\" areas in very mild cases to brown discoloration and pitting in severe cases.\n\nIn \"very mild\" fluorosis, less than 25% of the tooth surface is affected, with small, opaque, scattered white areas. In the \"mild\" form, up to half of the tooth surface can be involved with mottled patches. Moderate fluorosis affects all tooth surfaces with mottled appearance, and brown stains may be present. Severe fluorosis is characterized by widespread brown discoloration, discrete or confluent pitting, and teeth may look corroded.\n\nThe diagnosis of fluorosis can be made through visual clinical examination of dry and clean tooth surfaces under good lighting. The appearance of snowflaking, white spots, narrow white lines following the perikymata, or patches that may coalesce can indicate mild fluorosis. The severity of fluorosis can vary among individuals based on the duration, timing, and dosage of fluoride exposure.\n\nIt's worth noting that people with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria). However, in moderate to severe cases, the teeth are weakened and can suffer permanent physical damage. While there may be cosmetic concerns with fluorosis, its impact on dental decay prevention is a potential benefit.\n\nReference:\n- Dental fluorosis is a common disorder, characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. It appears as a range of visual changes in enamel causing degrees of intrinsic tooth discoloration, and, in some cases, physical damage to the teeth. The severity of the condition is dependent on the dose, duration, and age of the individual during the exposure. The \"very mild\" (and most common) form of fluorosis, is characterized by small, opaque, \"paper white” areas scattered irregularly over the tooth, covering less than 25% of the tooth surface. In the \"mild\" form of the disease, these mottled patches can involve up to half of the surface area of the teeth. When fluorosis is moderate, all of the surfaces of the teeth are mottled and teeth may be ground down and brown stains frequently \"disfigure\" the teeth. Severe fluorosis is characterized by brown discoloration and discrete or confluent pitting; brown stains are widespread and teeth often present a corroded-looking appearance.

It occurs widely as an accessory mineral in igneous rocks and in calcium rich metamorphic rocks. It commonly occurs as a detrital or diagenic mineral in sedimentary rocks and is an essential component of phosphorite ore deposits. It occurs as a residual mineral in lateritic soils. Fluorapatite is found in the teeth of sharks and other fishes in varying concentrations. It is also present in human teeth that have been exposed to fluoride ions, for example, through water fluoridation or by using fluoride-containing toothpaste. The presence of fluorapatite helps prevent tooth decay or dental caries. Fluoroapatite has a critical pH of 4.5, thus it makes tooth structure more resistant to additional caries attack. It has a mild bacteriostatic property as well, which helps decrease the proliferation of Streptococcus mutans, the predominant bacterium related to dental caries.\n\nThe prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily attributed to the intake of excessive amounts of fluoride during the tooth development period, typically from birth to around 6-8 years of age. This condition occurs when there is an excessive incorporation of fluoride into dental enamel and dentine, which disrupts the normal maturation of the enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary from very mild, characterized by small white areas in the enamel, to severe cases where teeth appear stained and pitted.\n\nWhile drinking water is commonly associated with fluoride exposure, the increase in dental fluorosis prevalence over the past few decades is largely due to fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water. These additional sources include toothpastes, mouth rinses, fluoride supplements, fluoridated salt or milk, as well as locally applied dental gels, solutions, and varnishes. These sources contribute to the overall fluoride exposure during tooth development, leading to the development of dental fluorosis.\n\nIt is worth noting that exposure to excessive levels of fluoride after tooth development, such as through drinking water, seems to have little impact on the extent of dental fluorosis. Therefore, it is during the period of enamel formation that fluoride intake should be carefully monitored to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis.\n\nApart from dental fluorosis, excessive fluoride incorporation into bone can cause skeletal fluorosis. This condition occurs as a result of increased fluoride levels in the bone, leading to brittleness and a decreased ability to withstand pressure. Skeletal fluorosis has different stages, starting with an asymptomatic increase in bone mass in the preclinical phase. In the first and second clinical stages, symptoms may include sporadic pain and stiffness in the joints, chronic joint pain, and osteosclerosis.\n\nIn summary, while drinking water can contribute to fluoride exposure, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily due to excessive fluoride intake during tooth development from various sources. Monitoring fluoride intake during this period is crucial to prevent dental fluorosis.\n\nMottled enamel, also known as dental fluorosis, is primarily caused by excessive exposure to fluoride during the development of teeth. Dental fluorosis occurs when high levels of fluoride are ingested during the tooth mineralization process, which usually occurs in childhood. While fluoride is beneficial for dental health in appropriate amounts, excessive intake can lead to the appearance of white or brown spots on the teeth.\n\nFluoride is commonly found in drinking water, toothpaste, mouth rinses, and certain foods and beverages. When children are exposed to excessive fluoride, it can result in the disruption of enamel formation, leading to the appearance of mottled enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary depending on the level of fluoride exposure.\n\nIt's worth noting that dental fluorosis is primarily a cosmetic condition and does not usually cause any functional problems or pain. However, in severe cases, the enamel may become pitted or rough, and teeth may be more prone to staining and decay.\n\nPrevention of dental fluorosis involves several measures, such as using fluoride-containing products in appropriate amounts, teaching children to practice proper oral hygiene, and monitoring their fluoride intake from multiple sources. Dentists can also provide guidance on fluoride supplementation or the use of alternative sources of drinking water if necessary.\n\nIn summary, the cause of mottled enamel, or dental fluorosis, is excessive exposure to fluoride during tooth development. Implementing preventive measures and maintaining proper oral hygiene can help minimize the risk of dental fluorosis.\n\n or mine waste dumps that will leach arsenic. Natural fluoride in groundwater is of growing concern as deeper groundwater is being used, \"with more than 200 million people at risk of drinking water with elevated concentrations.\" Fluoride can especially be released from acidic volcanic rocks and dispersed volcanic ash when water hardness is low. High levels of fluoride in groundwater is a serious problem in the Argentinean Pampas, Chile, Mexico, India, Pakistan, the East African Rift, and some volcanic islands (Tenerife) In areas that have naturally occurring high levels of fluoride in groundwater which is used for drinking water, both dental and skeletal fluorosis can be prevalent and severe.\n\nQuestion: where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands. In certain sensory neurons (pseudounipolar neurons), such as those for touch and warmth, the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction \n\n The ganglion cell layer (ganglionic layer) is a layer of the retina that consists of retinal ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells. The cells are somewhat flask-shaped; the rounded internal surface of each resting on the stratum opticum, and sending off an axon which is prolonged into it. From the opposite end numerous dendrites extend into the inner plexiform layer, where they branch and form flattened arborizations at different levels. The ganglion cells vary much in size, and the dendrites of the smaller ones as a rule arborize in the inner plexiform layer as soon as they enter it; while those of the larger cells ramify close to the inner nuclear layer.\n\nThe transmission of visual information from the eye to the brain involves several layers and components within the eye. Starting from the posterior (back) of the eye, we have the following layers:\n\n1. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE): This is the outermost layer of the retina. It contains pigmented cells that help absorb excess light and nourish the retina.\n\n2. Layer of rods and cones (R&C): This layer contains the photoreceptor cells of the retina. Rod cells are responsible for detecting dim light and are more numerous, while cone cells are responsible for color vision and visual acuity.\n\n3. External limiting membrane (ELM): This layer is formed by the junctional complexes of the photoreceptor cells. It helps maintain the organization of the retina.\n\n4. Outer plexiform layer (OPL): This layer contains neural processes and synapses of rod and cone cells with bipolar, amacrine, interplexiform, and horizontal cells. Synaptic connections occur in this layer, allowing for summation and integration of visual signals.\n\n5. Outer nuclear layer (ONL): This layer contains the nuclei of rod and cone cells.\n\nMoving towards the anterior (front) of the eye, we also have the inner layers:\n\n6. Inner plexiform layer (IPL): This layer is located between the OPL and the ganglion cell layer. It contains synapses between the bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells.\n\n7. Ganglion cell layer: This layer contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells, which are responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. The ganglion cells send their axons towards the posterior of the eye to form the optic nerve.\n\nThe optic nerve is a bundle of these axons, which exits the eye at a site called the optic disc or blind spot. The optic nerve carries the visual information to the brain for further processing and interpretation.\n\nIn summary, the layers and components involved in the transmission of visual information to the brain include the retinal pigment epithelium, layer of rods and cones, external limiting membrane, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, ganglion cell layer, and the optic nerve. These structures work together to capture, process, and transmit visual signals to the brain for perception.\n\nThe optic nerve plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. When light enters the eye and strikes the retina, it triggers a cascade of chemical and electrical events that lead to the generation of nerve impulses. These impulses are then transmitted through the fibers of the optic nerve to various visual centers in the brain.\n\nThe retina is the innermost layer of tissue in the eye and is responsible for converting light into electrical neural impulses. It consists of several layers of interconnected neurons and is supported by pigmented epithelial cells. The primary light-sensing cells in the retina are called photoreceptor cells, which can be further categorized into rods and cones. Rods function primarily in dim light and provide black-and-white vision, while cones are responsible for color perception and high-acuity vision in well-lit conditions.\n\nThe neural signals generated by the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons in the retina before being transmitted to the brain. The output of these neurons takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells. These ganglion cells have axons that bundle together to form the optic nerve.\n\nThe optic nerve carries the electrical impulses generated by the retinal ganglion cells and transmits them to the brain. The information is then processed in various visual centers of the brain, leading to the creation of visual perception. This complex process allows us to interpret and understand the visual world around us.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the retina, including the optic nerve, is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. During vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon. This close relationship between the retina and the brain enables the non-invasive visualization of the retina, providing valuable insights into the functioning of the central nervous system.\n\nTherefore, the optic nerve serves as a vital pathway through which visual information is transmitted from the retina to the brain, allowing us to perceive and make sense of the visual world.\n\nThe ganglion cells in the retina have an important function in processing visual information. They receive input from photoreceptor cells through intermediate cells such as bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells. Ganglion cells then transmit this visual information to the brain via their axons.\n\nThe axons of ganglion cells are myelinated, meaning they are covered in a fatty substance called myelin. These myelinated parts of the axons are located outside of the eye. The axons of ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain.\n\nIn terms of connectivity in the brain, the axons of ganglion cells primarily connect to a specific region called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The LGN is part of the thalamus, which acts as a relay station for sensory information traveling between different areas of the brain. From there, visual information is further processed and sent to other areas of the brain responsible for interpreting and perceiving vision.\n\nOverall, ganglion cells play a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to higher centers in the brain for further processing and interpretation.\n\nReference:\n- A ganglion cell (sometimes called a gangliocyte) is a type of neuron located in the retina of the eye that receives visual information from photoreceptors via various intermediate cells such as bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells.\n- Retinal ganglion cells’ axons are myelinated.

(occasionally shortened to I'm a Celebrity) is an Australian reality television series on Network 10 which is based on the British television show of the same name. The series aired mainly on Network 10 and 10 HD. The series sees celebrities living in the jungle with few creature comforts, and competing in various challenges to earn meals and other luxuries. The celebrities compete for $100,000 to be donated to their chosen charity. The series is set in Kruger National Park, South Africa, and is hosted by Julia Morris and Chris Brown. On 16 July 2015 the series was renewed \n\n I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! returned for its seventeenth series on 19 November 2017 on ITV. The series is the third in a three-year contract, as confirmed by Ant & Dec at the end of the Coming Out show in December 2016. In October 2017, it was confirmed that Ant & Dec would return to host the series, despite rumours suggesting that the pair would not be present due to Ant's admittance to rehab earlier in the year for drugs and alcohol addiction. Made in Chelsea star Georgia Toffolo won the series on 10 December 2017, with Hollyoaks actor Jamie Lomas finishing runner up, and broadcaster Iain Lee finishing third. This was the first time in the show's history that women won three consecutive series. Professional boxer Amir Khan also became the highest-paid contestant in the history of the show, beating the previous £400,000 record held by Katie Price in series 9. Three days into the series, Jack Maynard was removed from the jungle after offensive messages on Twitter were discovered.\n\n I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! returned for its fifteenth series on 15 November 2015 on ITV. On 11 October 2015, a 5-second teaser aired on ITV for the first time, with more short trailers following, with Ant & Dec yelling \"Let's get ready to jungle!\", a pun on their well-known song \"Let's Get Ready to Rhumble\". Geordie Shore's Vicky Pattison won the show on 6 December 2015, with Union J singer George Shelley finishing runner up. This was the second time that a late-entry contestant had won the show, the first being Christopher Biggins in 2007. Ant & Dec both returned as presenters of the main show, whilst Joe Swash and Laura Whitmore returned to present the ITV2 spin-off show, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!, alongside David Morgan, who replaced Rob Beckett.\n\n The second season of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here! premiered on June 1, 2009 and concluded on June 24, 2009. The season, aired on NBC, a revival of the ABC series of the same name and continued to follow the same format as the original British series. It was also broadcast in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In Ireland, the show aired on TV3, three days behind the original NBC airings, and in the UK, it aired on ITV2 with a seven-day delay. The show was aired on STAR World in South East Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea \n\n I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! returned for its thirteenth series on 17 November 2013 on ITV, and ended on 8 December 2013. The show was confirmed to be returning to ITV at the end of the previous series. On 21 October 2013, two teasers were revealed for the new series, which were broadcast on air across the ITV network in the run up to the series' premiere. Ant & Dec both returned as presenters of the show, whilst Joe Swash, Laura Whitmore and Rob Beckett returned to present the ITV2 spin-off show, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here Now!.

The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form (how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix – the original version has been a prototype. In Ben 10: Omniverse, the Nemetrix, a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix \n\n After Ben's last battle with Vilgax, which destroyed the Omnitrix, Ben replaces it with the Ultimatrix, a device which allows him to evolve his alien forms into their ultimate forms. With the recent public reveal of his identity, Ben has become a worldwide celebrity. Meanwhile, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin must stop an Osmosian villain named Aggregor, who hunts aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy and intends to use their powers to achieve the \"ultimate prize\". Later, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin have to prevent an extradimensional entity called Diagon from taking over the universe.\n\nQuestion: ben 10 ultimate alien episode 2 season 1\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Alternately, the edible, fuzzy peach fruits are also used along with regular tea to prepare healthy drinks.\nAccording to some ancient texts, the fresh leaves of peach were used to make a poultice and applied topically to eradicate worms. On the other hand, an herbal infusion prepared from the dried leaves was regularly consumed to get rid of intestinal worms. The decomposed leaves were considered to be a remedy for warts in Italy. Both leaves and bark of the peach tree were also used for treating bronchitis and whooping cough.\nThe fibers and potassium in the tea facilitate bowel movements, preventing common digestive conditions such as constipation, gastritis, colitis, and stomach ulcers as well as eliminating the toxic wastes from the body, thereby promoting the function of the kidneys and liver.\nIts antioxidant effects coming from the presence of zinc, ascorbic acid, and vitamin C might be useful in promoting healing of wounds as well as fortifying the immune system by fighting against infections, and thus helping in managing pneumonia, common cold, diarrhea, and malaria.\nBesides antioxidants, including chlorogenic acid, it contains vitamin A that plays a role in reducing the risk of oral and lung cancer.\nIn addition to having lutein and lycopene, its potassium content aid in metabolizing carbohydrates as well as stabilizing the electrolyte levels that helps in curbing the risk of serious heart disorders.\nIts beta-carotene being a precursor of vitamin A is believed to promote good vision by protecting the retina, along with lutein and zeaxanthin, preventing age-related vision loss and night blindness.\nA good source of calcium, phosphorus and fluoride, the herbal tea might be beneficial for strengthening the bones and teeth, minimizing the risk of osteoporosis and preventing dental cavities.\nIt magnesium content helps in calming the nerves providing relief from stress and anxiety as well as managing the symptoms of depression.\nApart from being low in calories and fats and having phenolic compounds, its natural sugars neither affects the blood sugar levels nor accumulates as fats in the body, reducing the risk of obesity.\nConsumption of peach leaf tea might be effective for reducing bronchitis, cough, insomnia, high blood pressure, and bad breath.\nYou can add some milk to the mixture to enjoy a cup of peach milk tea.\nYou may also add some peach syrup to the drink for enhancing the flavor.\nConsumption of peach herbal tea does not lead to any adverse effects. However, its excess intake might cause abdominal distress. Its use should be immediately discontinued in case of an allergic reaction.\nThe laxative properties of the leaf tea make it unfavorable for drinking by pregnant women. It would be safer to avoid its consumption by breastfeeding mothers.\nOrganic peach tea leaves and tea bags as well as its other popular variations like ginger peach tea, peach green tea, white peach tea, peach black tea, peach oolong tea, peach mango tea, can be purchased online or from any herbal tea selling shop. Bottled or canned peach ice tea can also be availed from any online herbal tea store.\nOne Response to \"Peach Tea\"\nI will try the peach leaf tea. i will be using fresh peach leaves from my garden. it seems that i have a new case of bronchitis so i need help with it.\n\n  Peaches grow in a fairly limited range in dry, continental or temperate climates, since the trees have a chilling requirement that tropical or subtropical areas generally do not satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in certain areas of Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, and Nepal). Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 C. During the chilling period, key chemical reactions occur, but the plant appears dormant. Once the chilling period is fulfilled, the plant enters a second type of dormancy, the quiescence period. During quiescence, buds break and grow when sufficient warm weather favorable to growth is accumulated. The trees themselves can usually tolerate temperatures to \n\n Garden Peach tomatoes are a cultivar of tomato, native South American fruit mainly from Peru. Its small, bright yellow fruit is the standard globe shape of tomato. With its yellow coloring, blushing vaguely pink mottling when very ripe, and fuzzy skin, it resembles a peach. This cultivar is also extremely prolific. It is rich in iron and vitamin B5. The plant grows naturally between 200 and 1,000 metres from Colombia to Ecuador and Perú. Studies have shown they may lower cholesterol when eaten, or their juice drunk, regularly, similar to oranges or orange juice, but with a greater effect. This heirloom is colored exactly like a peach and has a sweet mild flavor. Fruits are 2-4 oz. and perfect for salads. The vines are prolific and very easy to grow in poor soil. Garden Peaches have soft fuzzy skins and mature in 65 days on average. They are suited to containers.\n\n In 2018, world production of peaches (combined with nectarines for reporting) was 24.5 million tonnes, led by China with 62% of the world total (table). The U.S. state of Georgia is known as the \"Peach State\" due to its significant production of peaches as early as 1571, with exports to other states occurring around 1858. In 2014, Georgia was third in US peach production behind California and South Carolina.\n\n South Carolina named the peach its official fruit in 1984. The peach became the state fruit of Georgia, nicknamed the \"Peach State\", in 1995. The peach went from feral trees utilized opportunistically to a tended commercial crop in the Southern United States in the 1850s, as the boll weevil attacked regional cotton crops. When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit. By 2017, Georgia's production represented 3–5% of the U.S. total. Alabama named it the \"state tree fruit\" in 2006. Delaware's state flower has been the peach blossom since 1995, and peach pie became its official dessert in 2009.\n\nQuestion: where do peaches come from in the us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The brain is the most sensitive. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur.\n\nExposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are at greater risk as they are more likely to put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl, previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.\n\nLead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, state laws that ban the use of and national policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint, gasoline, ammunition, wheel weights, and fishing weights reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. Workers' education could be helpful as well. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45 µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.\n\nIn 2016, lead is believed to have resulted in 540,000 deaths worldwide. It occurs most commonly in the developing world. There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the Flint water crisis. Those who are poor are at greater risk. Lead is believed to result in 0.6% of the world's disease burden. People have been mining and using lead for thousands of years. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Concerns for low levels of exposure began in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure.\n\nClassification\n\nClassically, \"lead poisoning\" or \"lead intoxication\" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects. Poisoning is a pattern of symptoms that occur with toxic effects from mid to high levels of exposure; toxicity is a wider spectrum of effects, including subclinical ones (those that do not cause symptoms). However, professionals often use \"lead poisoning\" and \"lead toxicity\" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of \"lead poisoning\" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead.\n\nThe amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity.\n\nLead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). Urine lead levels may be used as well, though less commonly. In cases of chronic exposure, lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. If a provider is performing a provocative excretion test, or \"chelation challenge\", a measurement obtained from urine rather than blood is likely to provide a more accurate representation of total lead burden to a skilled interpreter.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization state that a blood lead level of 10 μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10 μg/dL.\n\nLead forms a variety of compounds and exists in the environment in various forms. Features of poisoning differ depending on whether the agent is an organic compound (one that contains carbon), or an inorganic one. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nLead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.\n\nSymptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as insomnia, delirium, cognitive deficits, tremor, hallucinations, and convulsions.\n\nSymptoms may be different in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, abdominal pain, memory loss, kidney failure, male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.\n\nEarly symptoms of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased libido, and problems with sleep. An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are also early signs.\n\nIn adults, symptoms can occur at levels above 40 μg/dL, but are more likely to occur only above 50–60 μg/dL. Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60 μg/dL. However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. At blood lead levels between 25 and 60 μg/dL, neuropsychiatric effects such as delayed reaction times, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed motor nerve conduction and headache can occur. Anemia may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50 μg/dL. In adults, abdominal colic, involving paroxysms of pain, may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80 μg/dL. Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100 μg/dL include wrist drop and foot drop,  and signs of encephalopathy (a condition characterized by brain swelling), such as those that accompany increased pressure within the skull, delirium, coma, seizures, and headache. In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70 μg/dL. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100 μg/dL.\n\nAcute poisoning\nIn acute poisoning, typical neurological signs are pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with inflammation of the brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss of water from the gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as  acquired fanconi syndrome and decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.\n\nChronic poisoning\nChronic poisoning usually presents with symptoms affecting multiple systems, but is associated with three main types of symptoms: gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological. Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods. Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A \"lead hue\" of the skin with pallor and/or lividity is another feature. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders. Visual disturbance may present with gradually progressing blurred vision as a result of central scotoma, caused by toxic optic neuritis.\n\nEffects on children\n\nA pregnant woman who has elevated blood lead levels is at greater risk of a premature birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Young children are much more vulnerable to lead poisoning, as they absorb 4 to 5 times more lead than an adult from a given source. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.\n\nThe classic signs and symptoms in children are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, it is possible for fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to abnormally high lead concentrations.\n\nOn July 30, 2020, a report by UNICEF and Pure Earth revealed that lead poisoning is affecting children on a “massive and previously unknown scale.” According to the report, one in three children, up to 800 million globally, have blood lead levels at, or above, 5 micrograms per decilitre (µg/dL), the amount at which action is required.\n\nBy organ system\nLead affects every one of the body's organ systems, especially the nervous system, but also the bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.\n\nKidneys\nKidney damage occurs with exposure to high levels of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.\nLead poisoning inhibits excretion of the waste product urate and causes a predisposition for gout, in which urate builds up. This condition is known as saturnine gout.\n\nCardiovascular system\nEvidence suggests lead exposure is associated with high blood pressure, and studies have also found connections between lead exposure and coronary heart disease, heart rate variability, and death from stroke, but this evidence is more limited. People who have been exposed to higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher.\n\nReproductive system\nLead affects both the male and female reproductive systems. In men, when blood lead levels exceed 40 μg/dL, sperm count is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm, their motility, and their morphology.\nA pregnant woman's elevated blood lead level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able to pass through the placenta and into breast milk, and blood lead levels in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.\n\nNervous system\n\nLead affects the peripheral nervous system (especially motor nerves) and the central nervous system. Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats.\n\nLead exposure in young children has been linked to learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10 μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities. Increased blood lead level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, short-term memory, attention, reading and arithmetic ability, fine motor skills, emotional regulation, and social engagement.\n\nThe effect of lead on children's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance has been associated with lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5 μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10 μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35 μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.\n\nHigh blood lead levels in adults are also associated with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. It was found in a large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that blood lead levels in the range of 20–50 μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects. Increases in blood lead levels from about 50 to about 100 μg/dL in adults have been found to be associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.\n\nLead exposure in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead exposure in childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.\n\nExposure routes\n\nLead is a common environmental pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Storage batteries and ammunition are made with the largest amounts of lead consumed in the economy each year, in the US as of 2013. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, have been found to have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).\n\nOccupational exposure\n\nIn adults, occupational exposure is the main cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range workers, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Lead exposure can also occur with intense use of gun ranges, regardless of whether these ranges are indoor or out. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.\n\nFood \nLead may be found in food when food is grown in soil that is high in lead, airborne lead contaminates the crops, animals eat lead in their diet, or lead enters the food either from what it was stored or cooked in.\n\nIn Bangladesh, lead compounds have been added to turmeric to make it more yellow. This is believed to have started in the 1980s and continues as of 2019. It is believed to be one of the main sources of high lead levels in the country. In Hong Kong the maximum allowed lead parts per million is 6 in solid foods and 1 in liquid foods.\n\nPaint\nSome lead compounds are colorful and are used widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children are more prone to crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching, creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternatively, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed.\n\nIn oil painting, it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.\n\nSoil\n\nResidual lead in soil contributes to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been thought that the more polluted an area is with various contaminants, the more likely it is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. \n\nLead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, tire weights, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. For example, in the Montevideo neighborhood of La Teja, former industrial sites became important sources of exposure in local communities in the early 2000s. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.\n\nWater\nLead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington DC and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis (Flint, Michigan), a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source caused elevated lead levels  in domestic tap water.\n\nLike Flint MI and Washington DC, a similar situation affects the State of Wisconsin, where estimates call for replacement of up to 176,000 underground pipes made of lead known as lead service lines. The city of Madison, Wisconsin addressed the issue and replaced all of their lead service lines, but there are still others that have yet to follow suit. While there are chemical methods that could help reduce the amount of lead in the water distributed, a permanent fix would be to replace the pipes completely. While the state may replace the pipes below ground, it will be up to the homeowners to replace the pipes on their property, at an average cost of $3,000. Experts say that if the city were to replace their pipes and the citizens were to keep the old pipes located within their homes, there would be a potential for more lead to dissolve into their drinking water.\n \nCollected rainwater from roof runoff used as potable water may contain lead, if there are lead contaminants on the roof or in the storage tank. The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines allow a maximum of 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) lead in water.\n\nLead wheel weights have been found to accumulate on roads and interstates and erode in traffic entering the water runoff through drains. Leaded fishing weights accumulate in rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes.\n\nLead-containing products\nLead can be found in products such as kohl, an ancient cosmetic from the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa that has many other names; and from some toys. In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled from multiple countries owing to safety hazards including lead paint. Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead.\nLead is commonly incorporated into herbal remedies such as Indian Ayurvedic preparations and remedies of Chinese origin. There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like azarcon and greta, which each contain about 95% lead.\n\nIngestion of metallic lead, such as small lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and can be fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets may be at risk for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.\n\nIn May 2015, Indian food safety regulators in the state of Uttar Pradesh found that samples of Maggi 2 Minute Noodles contained lead up to 17 times beyond permissible limits. On 3 June 2015, New Delhi Government banned the sale of Maggi noodles in New Delhi stores for 15 days because it was found to contain lead beyond the permissible limit. The Gujarat FDA on June 4, 2015 banned the noodles for 30 days after 27 out of 39 samples were detected with objectionable levels of metallic lead, among other things. Some of India's biggest retailers like Future Group, Big Bazaar, Easyday and Nilgiris have imposed a nationwide ban on Maggi noodles. Many other states too have banned Maggi noodles.\n\nBullets\nContact with ammunition is a source of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 84,800 metric tons consumed in 2013, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cannot regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily for the benefit of the birds and their predators, rather than humans. Contamination from heavily used gun ranges is of concern to those who live near by.  Non-lead alternatives include copper, zinc, steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and polymer blends such as tungsten-polymer and copper-polymer.\n\nBecause game animals can be shot using lead bullets, the potential for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent study conducted by the CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).\n\nAccording to a study published in 2008, 1.1% of the 736 persons consuming wild game meat tested had PbB ≥5 μg/dl In November 2015 The US HHS/CDC/NIOSH designated 5 µg/dL (five micrograms per deciliter) of whole blood, in a venous blood sample, as the reference blood lead level for adults. An elevated BLL is defined as a BLL ≥5 µg/dL. This case definition is used by the ABLES program, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Previously (i.e. from 2009 until November 2015), the case definition for an elevated BLL was a BLL ≥10 µg/dL.\n\nCopper-jacked bullets can reduce lead exposure but are more expensive to produce than simply casing bullets from lead alone. Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive . However, the biggest impediment to using the vast majority of alternatives relates to current laws in the United States pertaining to armor-piercing rounds. Laws and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular .223 Remington, .308 Winchester and .30-06 to name just a few) . Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game; however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with blood lead levels in study is difficult. Bismuth is an element used as a lead-replacement for shotgun pellets used in waterfowl hunting although shotshells made from bismuth are nearly ten times the cost of lead.\n\nOpium \nLead contaminated opium has been the source of poisoning in Iran and other Middle Eastern countries.  This has also appeared in the illicit narcotic supply in North America, resulting in confirmed lead poisoning.\n\nPathophysiology\n\nExposure occurs through inhalation, ingestion or occasionally skin contact. Lead may be taken in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in aviation gasoline, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.\n\nThe main body tissues that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The half-life of lead in bone has been estimated as years to decades, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone.  The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40 days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.\nLead is removed from the body very slowly, mainly through urine. Smaller amounts of lead are also eliminated through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.\n\nLead has no known physiologically relevant role in the body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain the integrity of the cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.\n\nEnzymes\n\nThe primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.\n\nThe lead ion has a lone pair in its electronic structure, which can result in a distortion in the coordination of ligands, and in 2007 was hypothesized to be important in lead poisoning's effects on enzymes (see ).\n\nOne of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which is important in the biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Lead also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, another enzyme involved in the formation of heme. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the joining of protoporphyrin and Fe2+ to form heme. Lead's interference with heme synthesis results in production of zinc protoporphyrin and the development of anemia. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons. Elevation of aminolevulinic acid results in lead poisoning having symptoms similar to acute porphyria.\n\nNeurons\n\nThe brain is the organ most sensitive to lead exposure. Lead is able to pass through the endothelial cells at the blood brain barrier because it can substitute for calcium ions and be uptaken by calcium-ATPase pumps. Lead poisoning interferes with the normal development of a child's brain and nervous system; therefore children are at greater risk of lead neurotoxicity than adults are. In a child's developing brain, lead interferes with synapse formation  in the cerebral cortex, neurochemical development (including that of neurotransmitters), and organization of ion channels. It causes loss of neurons' myelin sheaths, reduces numbers of neurons, interferes with neurotransmission, and decreases neuronal growth.\n\nLead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), block NMDA receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration will effectively inhibit ongoing long-term potentiation (LTP), and lead to an abnormal increase in long-term depression (LTD) on neurons in the affected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LTD. The targeting of NMDA receptors is thought to be one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.\n\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis includes determining the clinical signs and the medical history, with inquiry into possible routes of exposure. Clinical toxicologists, medical specialists in the area of poisoning, may be involved in diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe main tool in diagnosing and assessing the severity of lead poisoning is laboratory analysis of the blood lead level (BLL).\n\nBlood film examination may reveal basophilic stippling of red blood cells (dots in red blood cells visible through a microscope), as well as the changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia (microcytosis and hypochromasia). This may be known as sideroblastic anemia. However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 (colbalamin) and folate deficiencies.\nContrary to other sideroblastic anemia, there are no ring sideroblasts in a bone marrow smear.\n\nExposure to lead also can be evaluated by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP is a part of red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35 μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.\n\nBlood lead levels are an indicator mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones can be measured noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; this may be the best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nFecal lead content that is measured over the course of a few days may also be an accurate way to estimate the overall amount of childhood lead intake. This form of measurement may serve as a useful way to see the extent of oral lead exposure from all the diet and environmental sources of lead.\n\nLead poisoning shares symptoms with other conditions and may be easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.\n\nReference levels\nThe current reference range for acceptable blood lead concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental sources of lead is less than 3.5 µg/dL for children. It was less than 25 µg/dL for adults. Previous to 2012 the value for children was 10 (µg/dl). Lead-exposed workers in the U.S. are required to be removed from work when their level is greater than 50 µg/dL if they do construction and otherwise greater than 60 µg/dL.\n\nIn 2015, US HHS/CDC/NIOSH designated 5 µg/dL (five micrograms per deciliter) of whole blood, in a venous blood sample, as the reference blood lead level for adults. An elevated BLL is defined as a BLL ≥5 µg/dL. This case definition is used by the ABLES program, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Previously (i.e. from 2009 until November 2015), the case definition for an elevated BLL was a BLL ≥10 µg/dL. The U.S. national BLL geometric mean among adults was 1.2 μg/dL in 2009–2010.\n\nBlood lead concentrations in poisoning victims have ranged from 30->80 µg/dL in children exposed to lead paint in older houses, 77–104 µg/dL in persons working with pottery glazes, 90–137 µg/dL in individuals consuming contaminated herbal medicines, 109–139 µg/dL in indoor shooting range instructors and as high as 330 µg/dL in those drinking fruit juices from glazed earthenware containers.\n\nPrevention\n\nIn most cases, lead poisoning is preventable by avoiding exposure to lead. Prevention strategies can be divided into individual (measures taken by a family), preventive medicine (identifying and intervening with high-risk individuals), and public health (reducing risk on a population level).\n\nRecommended steps by individuals to reduce the blood lead levels of children include increasing their frequency of hand washing and their intake of calcium and iron, discouraging them from putting their hands to their mouths, vacuuming frequently, and eliminating the presence of lead-containing objects such as blinds and jewellery in the house. In houses with lead pipes or plumbing solder, these can be replaced. Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water in the morning to flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes. Lead testing kits are commercially available for detecting the presence of lead in the household. Testing kit accuracy depends on the user testing all layers of paint and the quality of the kit; the US EPA only approves kits with an accuracy rating of at least 95%. Professional lead testing companies caution that DIY test kits can create health risks for users that do not understand their limitations and liability issues for employers with regard to worker protection. As hot water is more likely than cold water to contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula.  Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure. Measures such as dust control and household education do not appear to be effective in changing children's blood levels.\n\nPrevention measures also exist on national and municipal levels. Recommendations by health professionals for lowering childhood exposures include banning the use of lead where it is not essential and strengthening regulations that limit the amount of lead in soil, water, air, household dust, and products. Regulations exist to limit the amount of lead in paint; for example, a 1978 law in the US restricted the lead in paint for residences, furniture, and toys to 0.06% or less. In October 2008, the US Environmental Protection Agency reduced the allowable lead level by a factor of ten to 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air, giving states five years to comply with the standards. The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive limits amounts of lead and other toxic substances in electronics and electrical equipment. In some places, remediation programs exist to reduce the presence of lead when it is found to be high, for example in drinking water. As a more radical solution, entire towns located near former lead mines have been \"closed\" by the government, and the population resettled elsewhere, as was the case with Picher, Oklahoma in 2009. Removing lead from airplane fuel would also be useful.\n\nScreening\nScreening may be an important method of prevention for those at high risk, such as those who live near lead-related industries. The USPSTF has stated that general screening of those without symptoms include children and pregnant women is of unclear benefit as of 2019. The ACOG and APP, however, recommends asking about risk factors and testing those who have them.\n\nEducation \nThe education of workers on lead, its danger and how its workplace exposure can be decreased, especially when initial blood lead level and urine lead level are high, could help reduce the risk of lead poisoning in the workplace.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe mainstays of treatment are removal from the source of lead and, for people who have significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part of treatment for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.\n\nA chelating agent is a molecule with at least two negatively charged groups that allow it to form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.\n\nChelation therapy is used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is considered for people with blood lead levels above 25 µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.\n\nPeople receiving dimercaprol need to be assessed for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may be the case in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.\n\nChelating agents can have adverse effects; for example, chelation therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc. Chelating agents taken orally can increase the body's absorption of lead through the intestine.\n\nChelation challenge, also known as provocation testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique has been used to determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.\n\nEpidemiology\nSince lead has been used widely for centuries, the effects of exposure are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s as a result of the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.\n\nAlthough regulation reducing lead in products has greatly reduced exposure in the developed world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. Despite phase out in many parts of the global North, Global South exposure has increased by nearly 3 times. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn developed countries, people with low levels of education living in poorer areas are most at risk for elevated lead. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.\n\nRisk factors for elevated lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides). Adults with certain risk factors might be more susceptible to toxicity; these include calcium and iron deficiencies, old age, disease of organs targeted by lead (e.g. the brain, the kidneys), and possibly genetic susceptibility. \nDifferences in vulnerability to lead-induced neurological damage between males and females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be.\n\nIn adults, blood lead levels steadily increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children are more sensitive to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and may be more likely to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24 months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.\n\nNotable cases\n\nCases of mass lead poisoning can occur. 15,000 people are being relocated from Jiyuan in central Henan province to other locations after 1000 children living around China's largest smelter plant (owned and operated by Yuguang Gold and Lead) were found to have excess lead in their blood. The total cost of this project is estimated to around 1 billion yuan ($150 million). 70% of the cost will be paid by local government and the smelter company, while the rest will be paid by the residents themselves. The government has suspended production at 32 of 35 lead plants. The affected area includes people from 10 different villages.\n\nThe Zamfara State lead poisoning epidemic occurred in Nigeria in 2010. As of October 5, 2010 at least 400 children have died from the effects of lead poisoning.\n\nPrognosis\n\nReversibility\nOutcome is related to the extent and duration of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.\n\nEncephalopathy\nLead encephalopathy is a medical emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.\n\nLong-term\nExposure to lead may also decrease lifespan and have health effects in the long term. Death rates from a variety of causes have been found to be higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year). Furthermore, the neurological effects of lead exposure have been shown to be exacerbated and long lasting in low income children in comparison to those of higher economic standing. This does not imply that being wealthy can prevent lead from causing long-term mental health issues.\n\nViolence \n\nLead poisoning in children has been linked to changes in brain function that can result in low IQ, and increased impulsivity and aggression. These traits of childhood lead exposure are associated with crimes of passion, such as aggravated assault in young adults. An increase in lead exposure in children was linked to an increase in aggravated assault rates 22 year later. For instance, the peak in leaded gasoline use in the late 1970s corresponds to a peak in aggravated assault rates in the late 1990s in urban areas across the United States.\n\nHistory\n\nLead poisoning was among the first known and most widely studied work regarding environmental hazards. One of the first metals to be smelted and used, lead is thought to have been discovered and first mined in Anatolia around 6500 BC. Its density, workability, and corrosion resistance were among the metal's attractions.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist Nicander described the colic and paralysis seen in lead-poisoned people. Dioscorides, a Greek physician who lived in the 1st century AD, wrote that lead makes the mind \"give way\".\n\nLead was used extensively in Roman aqueducts from about 500 BC to 300 AD Julius Caesar's engineer, Vitruvius, reported, \"water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because white lead is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body.\" Gout, prevalent in affluent Rome, is thought to be the result of lead, or leaded eating and drinking vessels.  Sugar of lead (lead(II) acetate) was used to sweeten wine, and the gout that resulted from this was known as \"saturnine\" gout. It is even hypothesized that lead poisoning may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire, a hypothesis thoroughly disputed:\n\nHowever, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.\n\nRomans also consumed lead through the consumption of defrutum, carenum, and sapa, musts made by boiling down fruit in lead cookware. Defrutum and its relatives were used in ancient Roman cuisine and cosmetics, including as a food preservative. The use of leaden cookware, though popular, was not the general standard and copper cookware was used far more generally. There is also no indication how often sapa was added or in what quantity.\n\nThe consumption of sapa as having a role in the fall of the Roman Empire was used in a theory proposed by geochemist Jerome Nriagu to state that \"lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire\". In 1984, John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized the conclusions drawn by Nriagu's book as \"so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments.\"\n\nAfter antiquity, mention of lead poisoning was absent from medical literature until the end of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized dust and fumes containing lead compounds as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that were known to afflict miners, smelter workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.\n\nThe painter Caravaggio might have died of lead poisoning. Bones with high lead levels were recently found in a grave thought likely to be his. Paints used at the time contained high amounts of lead salts. Caravaggio is known to have exhibited violent behavior, a symptom commonly associated with lead poisoning.\n\nIn 17th-century Germany, the physician Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine to be the cause of an epidemic of colic. He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.\n\nIn the 18th century lead poisoning was fairly frequent on account of the widespread drinking of rum, which was made in stills with a lead component (the \"worm\"). It was a significant cause of mortality amongst slaves and sailors in the colonial West Indies. Lead poisoning from rum was also noted in Boston. Benjamin Franklin suspected lead to be a risk in 1786. Also in the 18th century, \"Devonshire colic\" was the name given to the symptoms suffered by people of Devon who drank cider made in presses that were lined with lead. Lead was added to cheap wine illegally in the 18th and early 19th centuries as a sweetener. The composer Beethoven, a heavy wine drinker, suffered elevated lead levels (as later detected in his hair) possibly due to this; the cause of his death is controversial, but lead poisoning is a contender as a factor.\n\nWith the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step in the understanding of childhood lead poisoning occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.\n\nThe 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.\n\nThe levels found today in most people are orders of magnitude greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. During the end of the 20th century, the blood lead levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. Blood lead levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.\n\nIn the late 1950s through the 1970s Herbert Needleman and Clair Cameron Patterson did research trying to prove lead's toxicity to humans. In the 1980s Needleman was falsely accused of scientific misconduct by the lead industry associates.\n\nIn 2002 Tommy Thompson, secretary of Health and Human Services appointed at least two persons with conflicts of interest to the CDC's Lead Advisory Committee.\n\nIn 2014 a case by the state of California against a number of companies decided against Sherwin-Williams, NL Industries and ConAgra and ordered them to pay $1.15 billion.

Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.\n\nFarm animals such as cows and horses as well as pet animals are also susceptible to the effects of lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels.\n\nWildlife\n\nLead, one of the leading causes of toxicity in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.\n\nThe critically endangered California condor has also been affected by lead poisoning. As scavengers, condors eat carcasses of game that have been shot but not retrieved, and with them the fragments from lead bullets; this increases their lead levels. Among condors around the Grand Canyon, lead poisoning due to eating lead shot is the most frequently diagnosed cause of death. In an effort to protect this species, in areas designated as the California condor's range the use of projectiles containing lead has been banned to hunt deer, feral pigs, elk, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, ground squirrels, and other non-game wildlife. Also, conservation programs exist which routinely capture condors, check their blood lead levels, and treat cases of poisoning.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nEnvironmental impact by effect\nOccupational diseases\nMass poisoning\nDisturbances of human pigmentation\nIntellectual disability\nBiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\n\n Lead, which was used in gasoline until 1995 and paint until 1978, is known to damage the nervous system in various ways. A few studies have found that people with high levels of lead in their body had twice the risk of Parkinson's disease. Epidemiological studies on lead, however, have found little evidence for a link with Parkinson's. Iron has been implicated in the etiology of Parkinson's disease, but there is no strong evidence that environmental exposure to it is associated with Parkinson's.\n\n The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint. The Act was enacted as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act\n\n Lead-based paint was widely used in the United States, because of its durability. The United States banned the manufacture of lead-based house paint in 1978 due to health concerns. Lead has long been considered to be a harmful environmental pollutant. Cited cases of lead poisoning date back to the early 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint \"poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors.\" Congress banned the use of lead-based paint in residential structures and environments, in 1971, in residential projects constructed by, or with the assistance of, the federal government, and \n\n In the past, lead was added to household paint to increase its drying speed and improve the durability and life of the finish. However, Lead is toxic and is a possible carcinogen. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm). In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that approximately 35 percent of U.S. homes (37 million) still contain some lead-based paint, a decline from 1990 estimate of 64 million homes with lead paint.\n\nQuestion: when did they stop putting lead in paint\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

But there are a few serious health conditions that plague the breed. However, not all Papillon pups will develop a health issue in their lifetime. It is important to keep up-to-date on vaccinations and routine vet check-ups, as these appointments give your vet ample opportunities to examine your pup for any prevalent health concerns.\nFor example, some Papillon dogs are prone to skin allergies, causing itchiness, blotchy skin, redness, and infection. Your vet will be able to examine your pup at the first sign of an outbreak and treat an allergic reaction before it becomes worse. The same goes for many other health conditions that are prominent in the Papillon breed.\nThis condition, a birth defect, begins with degeneration of the retina in both eyes. It is incurable, and it worsens with age, resulting in complete vision loss for both the nighttime and daytime. Symptoms include constant pupil dilation and disorientation.\nThis condition, most common in small dogs, occurs when the cushions between the vertebrae bulge outwards. It causes nerve damage, severe pain, and paralysis in some cases. Surgery is required to remedy this condition. If left untreated, this condition could progress to a dangerous, life-threatening point.\nOther health problems that your Papillon might suffer from include Von Willebrand’s Disease, patellar luxation, rapid dental decay, and obesity. There are also the usual illnesses that can affect any dog of any breed, such as heart disease and some kinds of cancer. The average Papillon lives a lengthy, healthy life between 13 to 15 years. But there have been a few cases where a pup has lived to 17 years old.\nNaturally gentle, lively, and friendly, the Papillon would make one of the best family pets, especially for families with children and other dogs. These pups are non-confrontational and affectionate, even towards most strangers. Most Papillons are clever, playful, and protective, so they would definitely bark if they felt threatened by an intruder. However, it would be best to rely on other pups to be watchdogs, as these purebreds would rather be sleeping with you at nighttime.\nWhile it would be a good idea to take these pups for a couple of short walks at least twice a day, the Papillon is a dog that would be just as happy snuggling on the couch for the afternoon. Their exercise needs are minimum, but they would love a quick romp and play in the backyard with your youngsters and other pups.\nPapillons are clever, agile, and alert with an innate eagerness to please their loved ones. Training sessions are easier with these pups than most other dogs because these purebreds pay close attention and grasp instructions quickly. The only training challenge you may face is housebreaking your Papillon. These purebreds love tricks and learning new ways to show their playful side to their loved ones, but house-training isn’t any fun to them. Make it fun for your Papillon with lots of praise, encouragement, and meaty, bite-sized rewards.\nLengthy and silky, the coat of the Papillon is low-shedding and quick to grow. Brush your Papillon 3-4 times a week with a soft to medium bristled brush. Bathe your Papillon once a month when she gets dirty or smelly. Or, take her to a professional groomer for a package of a bath, brush, and trim on a monthly basis.\nOther basic care needs for a Papillon include brushing her teeth once a day, clipping her toenails every 3-4 weeks, cleaning her ears once a week with a cotton swab and warm water, and trimming her fur once every 6-8 weeks.\nDue to their small stature, the Papillon needs a nutrient-rich diet to keep their little body energized and healthy. Divide ¾ to 1 cup of dry, high-quality kibble into 2-3 meals per day. The separation of individual meals will keep your pup satisfied and full throughout the day. And it also eliminates the possibility of food aggression between dogs. The Papillon loves treats, like any pup, but make sure they are bite-sized indulgences. Big treats pose a choking hazard to small dogs.\nPapillons are popular breeds because of their sweet nature and loving manner. Therefore, there is no shortage of Papillon breeders. However, make sure you ask to see health histories of both parents, as well as AKC documentation of the pup, before you invest in a breeder. Many breeders are trustworthy and reliable, but you have to weed out the ones who are only in the business for the money, not the health and care of the purebred.\nWhen you find a compassionate, reputable breeder, expect to shell out between $600 to $850 for a Papillon puppy. AKC-registered and show-quality puppies will generally cost more because bloodline guarantees are expensive.\nBefore you invest in a breeder, take a look through your local animal shelter. Or, give your local rescue group a call. There is an abundance of Papillons abandoned each year. And many of them still need good, happy homes. If you can give one of these pups a second chance at a loving environment, expect adoption fees to be between $75 to $250. With vaccinations, spay or neuter services, and an initial vet visit, that fee will likely rise to between $400 to $500.\nRanking takes into account a few basic factors including cost, skill level needed, high vs low maintenance and how critical regular training is to success. As far as family pets go, the Papillon is one of the best. This fact earns the pup a solid 1 on the integration scale. These purebreds have a natural eagerness to please their loved ones, which makes training easier. Their grooming regime is easy too, making the upkeep of the Papillon simple and doable for anyone.\n\n Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers are generally a long-lived breed. They are susceptible to various heritable diseases, although are most known for two protein wasting conditions: protein-losing nephropathy (PLN), where the dogs lose protein via the kidneys; and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), where the dogs fail to fully absorb protein in their digestive tracts, causing it to pass in their stool. Both PLN and PLE are potentially fatal, but if caught early enough, can sometimes be managed with strict dietary changes and pharmaceuticals. Laboratory tests can aid in diagnosing PLN and PLE; Wheaten owners should check their country's advised testing protocols. Research suggests that \n\n The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is an energetic and playful dog. It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear and/or aggression. A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier. It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the \"Wheaten greetin\". Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but are lively and can be more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly. They are cool-weather dogs and can become easily overheated in \n\n The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier ( - literally, \"Yellow Terrier\") is a pure-breed terrier originating from Ireland. Wheatens typically have one of two coat types: Irish or Heavy (American). The Irish coat is generally silkier and wavier than the Heavy, or American coat, which is thicker and fuller. Wheatens are generally friendly and playful, and tend to get along well with children and other dogs.\n\n and about 30 to 45 lb in weight. The breed has a square structure and is well built. Their soft, silky hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues if obtained from a reputable breeder. The Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier than the American variety and it has a devoted following in Ireland and Europe. Breeders of the pure Irish type believe this is the original working coat. The coat is not thin – breeders of the Irish type consider the American heavy coat \n\nQuestion: what breed of dog is the teddy bear dog\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Smith's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under Brigadier General Hugh Percy, a future Duke of Northumberland styled at this time by the courtesy title Earl Percy. The combined force of about 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown. The accumulated militias then blockaded the narrow land accesses to Charlestown and Boston, starting the siege of Boston.

The British officers were proven wrong. Shooting erupted at Lexington. There is still a debate as to whether it was a colonist or a British soldier who fired the first shot. The militia left the area, and the British moved on. The British then moved to Concord and faced a larger number of militia. The British were rapidly outnumbered at Concord, with the arrival of the slower moving militia; they had not \n\n April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at Concord. Several riders — including Paul Revere — alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered Lexington on the morning of April 19, they found 77 minutemen formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord. At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies. During \n\n  Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the British garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their leaders, leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775.

The Battle of Bunker Hill followed on June 17, 1775. It was a British victory—but at a great cost: about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force.

They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America. In late 1774, Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party.

Located north of Manassas, in Prince William County, Virginia, it preserves the site of two major American Civil War battles: the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, and the Second Battle of Bull Run which was fought between August 28 and August 30, 1862 (also known as the First Battle of Manassas and the Second Battle of Manassas, respectively). The peaceful Virginia countryside bore witness to clashes between the armies of the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy), and it was there that Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson acquired his nickname \"Stonewall\". The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 373 acres of the Second Battle of Bull Run battlefield in more than 10 transactions since 2000.\n\n At the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28-30, 1862), the regiment saw its first large-scale action. On the afternoon of the 29th, the Second Maryland, as part of James Nagle's brigade in Burnside's IX Corps, assaulted troops under the command of Confederate General T. J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, entrenched in an uncompleted railroad cut. After elements of the brigade pulled back in the face of a Confederate flanking attack, the Second Maryland found itself surrounded on three sides. The unit fought its way back to Union lines, but at the cost of nearly 200 men killed, wounded or captured in scarcely 15 minutes of combat.\n\n  The Second Battle of Bull Run or Battle of Second Manassas was fought August 29–30, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. It was the culmination of the Northern Virginia Campaign waged by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia against Union Maj. Gen.

The embarrassing rout of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's army during the battle made clear the fallacy of this viewpoint.

Epidemics swept through California Indian Country, such as the 1833 malaria epidemic. Early to mid 19th Century, coastal tribes of northwest California had multiple contacts with Russian explorers due to Russian colonization of the Americas. At that time period, Russian exploration of California and contacts with local population were usually associated with the activity of the Russian-American Company. A Russian explorer, Baron Ferdinand von Wrangell, visited California in 1818, 1833, and 1835. Looking for a potential site for a new outpost of the company in California in place \n\n Californio (plural Californios) is a term used to designate a Hispanic Californian, especially those descended from Spanish and Mexican settlers. California's Spanish-speaking community has resided there since 1683 and is made up of varying Spanish, Mexican, Mestizo, and Indigenous Californian origins. Alongside the Tejanos of Texas and Neomexicanos of New Mexico and Colorado, Californios are part of the larger Chicano/Mexican-American/Hispano community of the United States, which has inhabited the American Southwest and the West Coast since the 16th century. The term Californio (historical, regional Spanish for 'Californian') was originally applied by and to the Spanish-speaking residents of Las Californias during the periods of Spanish California and Mexican California, between 1683 and 1848. The first Californios were the children of the early Spanish military expeditions into northern reaches of the Californias. They established the \n\n and subsequently enabled the foundation of the California mission system. Later, the primary cultural focus of the Californio population became the Vaquero tradition practiced by the landed gentry, who received large land grants and created the Rancho system. In the 1820s-40s, American and European settlers increasingly migrated to Mexican California. Many married Californio women and became Mexican citizens, learning Spanish and often converting to Catholicism, the state religion. They are often also considered Californios, for their adherence to Californio language and culture. In 2017 there were 11.9 million Chicanos/Mexican American/Hispanos in California (30% of California's population). They make up the largest group of the 15.2 million California Hispanics, who total 40% of California's population. 2004 studies estimated that between 300,000 and 500,000 have ancestry descended from the Spanish and Mexican eras of California.\n\n In 1848 after the Mexican–American War, the annexation of Texas and the Southwest introduced a Hispanic population that had full citizenship status. About 10,000 Californios lived in the southern part of California, and were numerically overwhelmed by migrants form the East by 1900 that their identity was almost lost. In New Mexico, by contrast, the Mexican population maintained its highly traditionalistic and religious culture, and retained some political power, into the 21st century. The Tejano population of Texas supported the revolution against Mexico in 1836, and gained full citizenship. In practice, however, most were ranch hands with limited political rights under the control of local bosses.\n\n continued in this role as it changed from a Mexican territory to a United States possession. As foreign, non-Spanish speaking men moved into California, those who wished to join the upper echelons of the established social hierarchy began to use marriage with women of established Californio families as a way to join the elite. Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners had been common during the time of Mexican rule and these increased after the 1848 American annexation and Gold Rush in California. Such marriages combined the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. As Americans increased in number, however, they pushed out Californios from power in California.\n\nQuestion: in the early 1800s california society was dominated by which group\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Roosevelt enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act (Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195), which set stringent regulations on industry. Boyd Redner writes in A History of The Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute: “The National Industrial Recovery Act spelled out provisions to businessmen … every industry was to come under a code, and the code had two sets of regulations … [1.] regulations spelled out maximum hours that could be worked and the minimum hourly pay … and [2.] they were also to include a stipulation of Fair Trade Practices, so that one employer was required to join some code group.” Thirty five packaging machinery businessmen met in Buffalo, New York, in 1933, to decide \n\n In September 1931, Swope presented a proposal for recovery. Under Swope plan, the Federal Trade Commission would supervise trade associations established for each industry. Trade associations would cover every company with at least 50 employees after three years. Associations would regulate output and set prices. Workers would receive life insurance, pensions, and unemployment insurance paid for in part by employers. The Chamber of Commerce and other conservative groups provided enthusiastic support. President Herbert Hoover, who strongly supported voluntary trade associations, denounced the plan for being compulsory, inefficient, and monopolistic. In an oral history interview, Leon H. Keyserling said the New Deal's National Industrial Recovery Act \"started as a trade association act. The original draft of the act grew out of the so-called Gerard Swope plan for Recovery.\" When asked in November 1933 about an updated Swope Plan, President Roosevelt said, \"Mr. Swope's plan is a very interesting theoretical suggestion in regard to some ultimate development of N.R.A.\"\n\n The National Industry Recovery Act came into place on June 16, 1933, just five days after the end of 100 days. The act was an attempt to rebuild the economy from the severe deflation caused by the Great Depression. The act consists of two sections; the first promoted industrial recovery, and the second established the Public Works Administration (PWA). The National Industry Recovery Act set up the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The PWA used government money to build infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, for the state. This demand for construction created new jobs, which achieved Roosevelt's main priority. The National Recovery Act also improved working conditions and outlawed child labor. Wages increased, making it possible for workers to earn and spend more.\n\n In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Mary to chair the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the first government consumer rights group. Despite her inexperience, Mary's work with farming cooperatives and belief in the power of cooperation would come to be her greatest asset. Mary would promote the formation of consumer groups across the nation and encourage these groups to report their grievances to her office. Mary Rumsey's legacy to New Deal reforms would be continued by her younger brother, W. Averell Harriman. Averell was encouraged by his older sister to leave his finance job and join her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA, marking the beginning of his political career.\n\n When Franklin Roosevelt formed the National Recovery Administration (NRA) early in the New Deal, Davis was tapped as Deputy Administrator. The NRA was declared unconstitutional and disbanded in 1937, and Davis returned to New York to head the state's Labor Mediation Board. He developed such a good reputation as a mediator between management and labor that Roosevelt brought him back to Washington in 1941 to join (and soon chair) the National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB), which became the War Labor Board (WLB) in early 1942. Davis ran the Board until March 1945, when, seeing the end of the war in sight, Roosevelt named him Director of Economic Stabilization, to manage the return to a peace-time \n\nQuestion: who was appointed to manage the national recovery administration\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It begins when deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, specifically the right ventricle, into the pulmonary artery. This artery branches out into smaller blood vessels, called pulmonary arterioles, which further divide into even smaller capillaries within the lungs. In the capillaries, gas exchange occurs, where carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. Oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and returns to the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium, to be pumped out to the rest of the body.\n\nOn the other hand, systemic circulation refers to the movement of blood between the heart and the rest of the body. It begins when oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, specifically the left ventricle, through the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. The aorta branches out into smaller arteries, which further divide into arterioles and eventually into microscopic capillaries that reach nearly every tissue and cell in the body. In the capillaries, nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up. Deoxygenated blood then collects in venules, merges into larger veins, and eventually returns to the right atrium of the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava.\n\nOne key difference between pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation is the amount of resistance encountered by each circuit. The pulmonary circulation has a lower resistance compared to the systemic circulation. This is due to the fact that the pulmonary arteries have a larger total cross-sectional area than the systemic arteries, which reduces the overall resistance to blood flow. This is important as it allows for optimal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that occurs in the capillaries of the lungs.\n\nIn addition, the pulmonary circulation also differs from systemic circulation in terms of the pressure levels. The pressure within the pulmonary circulation is much lower compared to the systemic circulation. The right side of the heart, which pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation, has a lower muscular structure compared to the left side of the heart. This is because the pulmonary circulation only needs to pump blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart, whereas the systemic circulation has to deliver blood to all the organs and tissues throughout the body, requiring a higher pressure.\n\nIn summary, while both pulmonary and systemic circulations are essential for the proper functioning of the human body, they differ in terms of the direction of blood flow, the sites of gas exchange, the resistance encountered, and the pressure levels. By understanding these differences, we can appreciate the complexity and efficiency of the cardiovascular system.\n\nPulmonary circulation and systemic circulation are two distinct pathways through which blood is transported in the body. While both systems involve the flow of blood, they differ in their purpose and function.\n\nPulmonary circulation refers to the circulation of blood between the heart and the lungs. Its primary function is to oxygenate the blood. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart and is then pumped into the right ventricle. From the right ventricle, the blood is pushed into the pulmonary artery, which splits into smaller branches and delivers the blood to the capillaries of the lungs. In the lungs, the exchange of gases occurs, with carbon dioxide being expelled and oxygen being absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium before being pumped into the systemic circulation.\n\nSystemic circulation, on the other hand, is responsible for distributing oxygenated blood to all tissues and organs of the body and collecting deoxygenated blood from those tissues to be returned to the heart. Oxygenated blood from the left atrium enters the left ventricle, which then pumps it into the main artery of the body, the aorta. From the aorta, the blood is distributed through a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the veins, entering the right atrium to complete the cycle.\n\nOne key distinction between pulmonary and systemic circulation is the blood pressure within the two systems. The pressure in the pulmonary circulation is significantly lower compared to the systemic circulation. This difference is due to the thinner walls and smaller resistance vessels in the lungs, as the primary function of pulmonary circulation is gas exchange rather than supplying nutrients to tissues.\n\nAdditionally, pulmonary circulation serves as a unique site for the regulation of blood flow. In circumstances of low oxygen levels (hypoxia), such as occurs at high altitudes or in lung diseases, the blood vessels within the lungs can undergo pulmonary vasoconstriction. This constriction helps redirect blood flow from poorly ventilated areas of the lungs to well-ventilated regions, optimizing gas exchange. This mechanism is not present in the systemic circulation.\n\nTo summarize, pulmonary circulation focuses on oxygenating blood through the exchange of gases in the lungs, while systemic circulation distributes oxygenated blood to the body's tissues and collects deoxygenated blood. The two circulatory systems differ in their purpose, blood pressure, and unique regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThe left atrium receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins.The left side of the heart pumps blood through the high-pressure systemic circulation.The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries.It is surrounded by a tough fibrous sac, the pericardium, which also contains the beginnings and ends of the great vessels entering and leaving the heart. Through the pericardium, the heart is strongly attached to the diaphragm and neighboring organs that lie in the thoracic cavity. The heart is a muscular pump that maintains unidirectional flow of blood. The heart contains four chambers—the right and left atria and right and left ventricles—through which blood is pumped (see Fig. 13.1). Valves guard the exits of the chambers, preventing backflow of blood. An interatrial septum and an interventricular septum separate the right and left sides of the heart. The right side of the heart pumps blood through pulmonary circulation. The right atrium receives blood returning from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae, the two largest veins of the body (Fig. 13.3). The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries. The left side of the heart pumps blood through systemic circulation. The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins. The left ventricle receives blood from the left atrium and pumps it into the aorta for distribution into the remainder of the body. FIGURE 13.3 • Diagram of the blood circulation. This diagram shows the right and left side of the heart artificially separated. The right side of the heart pumps blood through the low-pressure pulmonary circulation. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood returning from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae. The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries. The left side of the heart pumps blood through the high-pressure systemic circulation. The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins.The heart contains the following:  A musculature of cardiac muscle for contraction to propel the blood. A fibrous skeleton that consists of four fibrous rings surrounding the valve orifices, two fibrous trigones connecting the rings, and the membranous part of the inter-ventricular and interatrial septa.The fibrous rings are composed of dense irregular connective tissue.\n\nBlood flow through the heart follows a specific pathway to ensure proper circulation throughout the body. The heart functions as a double pump in the cardiovascular system, with two circuits: the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation.\n\nIn the pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood is collected in the right atrium from the body via the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. From there, it is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve and into the pulmonary artery, which branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries to supply each lung. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood.\n\nOn the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation.\n\nThroughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. These valves, including the tricuspid valve, bicuspid valve, aortic valve, and pulmonary valve, prevent the backward flow of blood, a condition known as regurgitation.\n\nIn summary, blood flows through the heart by first entering the right atrium, then passing through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. It is then pumped into the pulmonary artery through the pulmonary valve, where it undergoes gas exchange in the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues.\n\nReference:\n- Cardiac physiology or heart function is the study of healthy, unimpaired function of the heart: involving blood flow; myocardium structure; the electrical conduction system of the heart; the cardiac cycle and cardiac output and how these interact and depend on one another.\n- Blood flow: The heart functions as a pump and acts as a double pump in the cardiovascular system to provide a continuous circulation of blood throughout the body. This circulation includes the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation. Both circuits transport blood but they can also be seen in terms of the gases they carry. The pulmonary circulation collects oxygen from the lungs and delivers carbon dioxide for exhalation. The systemic circuit transports oxygen to the body and returns relatively de-oxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the pulmonary circuit.\n- Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. The pulmonary artery (also trunk) branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries to supply each lung. Blood is prevented from flowing backwards (regurgitation) by the tricuspid, bicuspid, aortic, and pulmonary valves.\n- The function of the right heart is to collect de-oxygenated blood in the right atrium from the body via the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus, and pump it through the tricuspid valve, right ventricle, semilunar pulmonary valve, and into the pulmonary artery in the pulmonary circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation.\n\nIn the heart, there are two main pathways for blood circulation: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. Pulmonary circulation refers to the circulation of blood between the heart and the lungs, while systemic circulation involves the circulation of blood throughout the rest of the body.\n\nDuring pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae and enters the right atrium. From there, it flows into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs for oxygenation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released, and oxygen is absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium.\n\nSystemic circulation begins when oxygenated blood enters the left atrium from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. The blood then flows into the left ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta. From the aorta, the oxygenated blood is distributed to the rest of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. As the oxygen is used up and waste products are produced, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process of circulation begins again.\n\nTo facilitate these pathways and maintain the structure of the heart, there is a fibrous skeleton composed of fibrous rings and trigones. These structures surround the valve orifices and encircle the base of the arteries and the openings between the atria and the ventricles. The fibrous rings are made of dense irregular connective tissue.\n\nIn summary, the right side of the heart is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs during pulmonary circulation, while the left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body during systemic circulation. The fibrous skeleton in the heart provides structural support and separates the different chambers to ensure proper blood flow.\n\nQuestion: how oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Today the minimum age is 60 years old minimum age for men and women with 35 years of contribution. New elected members will be automatically in the general regime, with extinction of the current regime. Current and former congressmen insured from the Congressional Social Security Plan will also be hit by the reform.\n\n For those who are against Social Security reform, the government's proposal to establish the minimum age as the sole criterion for retirement disregards the different life expectations within Brazil. For example, while states such as São Paulo, Distrito Federal, Espirito Santo and Rio Grande do Sul have an average of 77 years of life expectancy, in other states such as Rondônia, Roraima, Alagoas, Piauí and Maranhão, the average is 70 years. In this sense, the minimum age of 62 for women and 65 for men proposed by the current government is very high and close to the average life expectancy of some states. In addition, increasing the minimum contribution time to 20 years for men is disregarding the Brazilian reality - marked by informal work especially for people with lower education and income - and hindering access to retirement. Today, 15% of workers cannot contribute enough to retire.\n\n system in 1986 by cutting benefit levels and raising the plan's specified age at which benefits began from 60 to 65. Under the revised system, contributions paid in equal share by employer and employee were expected to be equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system. However, problems then arose in securing employment opportunities for the 60-to-65 age group. In 1990 some 90% of companies paid retirement benefits to their employees in the form of lump-sum payments and pensions. Some companies based the payment amount on the employee's base pay, while others used formulas independent of base pay. Because the system was designed to reward long service, payment rose progressively with the number of years worked.\n\n The proposal creates a minimum retirement age. At the end of the transition period, there is no longer the possibility of retirement for contribution time. The minimum retirement age will be 62 for women and 65 for men for both private and servants.\n\n and the difficulty in finding employment increases with age. This pattern is evidenced by the unemployment rates for different age-groups and by the number of applicants per job vacancy for each age-group in openings handled by public employment offices. As the Japanese population ages, such trends may grow. Most Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. During most of the postwar period, that age was 55. Because government social security payments normally begin at age 60, workers are forced to find reemployment to fill the five-year gap. However, in 1986 the Japanese Diet passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60. Many Japanese companies raised the retirement age they had set, partly \n\nQuestion: when did the government change the retirement age\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From an Italian American family, Jane is brash, sarcastic, and often prickly but also a confident and independent woman as well as a brilliant detective. She is the tomboy daughter of an overprotective mother. She is extremely competitive, especially with her younger brother, Frankie (also a cop), who is often caught in her shadow. Jane can tackle a perp like a linebacker. She rarely lets her guard down with anyone, except her best friend, Maura Isles. She is something of a slob; her apartment has been shown on several occasions to be quite \n\nJill, 16, learned from genetic testing at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) that she had Kallmann syndrome. Since her diagnosis, treatment has put her growth back on track.\nWhen Jill was 4, her pediatrician discovered she didn’t have a sense of smell. Her doctor wasn’t worried about it, and not being able to smell didn’t stop her from doing anything she wanted to do.\nShe started playing soccer at age 6 and added lacrosse in elementary school. As a high school sophomore, she became a cheerleader, and she also plays the drums, guitar and piano in addition to acting and singing in school musicals.\nBut as her peers went through puberty, she did not. At 15, she was 5 feet, 3 inches, which was in the normal range. Still, her pediatrician advised her to consult with an endocrinologist to determine if something was amiss.\nIn August 2016, she had an appointment at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia with endocrinologist Maria Vogiatzi, MD, Director of the Adrenal and Puberty Center.\nDr. Vogiatzi ordered several tests, including an MRI of Jill’s brain to check if her pituitary or hypothalamus looked abnormal, but unfortunately nothing was conclusive. An ultrasound of her pelvic area showed everything was in order.\nDr. Vogiatzi advised her to come back in six months to give puberty a chance to start on its own. When it hadn’t, Dr. Vogiatzi referred Jill to Louisa Pyle, MD, PhD, and Emma Bedoukian, MS, of the Differences of Sexual Development and Endogenetics Clinic, within the Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center (RIMGC). They ordered genetic testing.\nThe genetic testing results confirmed their and Dr. Vogiatzi’s suspicions, based on Jill’s missing sense of smell; she had Kallmann syndrome.\nKallmann syndrome combines an impaired sense of smell with a hormonal disorder that delays or prevents puberty.\nShe had a mutation in the FGFR1 gene. Kallmann syndrome is a genetic condition in which the hypothalamus, a gland in the brain, does not produce certain hormones that tell the pituitary gland to release more hormones to tell the ovaries to begin puberty. FGFR1 mutations are the cause of about 10 percent of Kallman syndrome cases.\nSome people with Kallmann syndrome also have complications such a cleft lip or palate, absence of a kidney, shortened digits, deafness, and abnormal eye movement. Jill didn’t have those symptoms.\nPeople with FGFR1 mutations may have any range of puberty from normal to start-and-stall puberty (as was the case with Jill) to no hint of sexual development, which is called complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency.\nThe good news is that some aspects of Kallmann syndrome are treatable with medications that take the place of the missing hormones. The genetic testing allowed Dr. Vogiatzi to tailor Jill’s treatment.\nJill began hormone-replacement therapy, and it has worked. She grew 2 inches and began puberty. Vogiatzi says the chances are strong that Jill will be able to have children in the future, with the help of medication.\nThe treatment certainly isn’t slowing Jill down, either.\nAs a high school junior, she has continued her sports and music activities plus volunteered at Princeton Special Sports, serve as a peer leader at her school, worked in an ice cream shop and organized an annual Alex’s Lemonade Stand to raise money for pediatric cancer research.\n\n The team investigates the murder of a marine who was beaten to death in his backyard. They find out his Marine wife Georgia Wooten (Christina Cox) was abused and that the husband had an affair. She is initially suspected and remains uncooperative throughout the investigation. At one point, Ducky suggests sending Ziva to talk to Wooten, noting that the former had \"been through things you and I can't even imagine\" and knew how it felt to be controlled, and was therefore the only one who could relate. Gibbs is reluctant to open Ziva's old wounds but ultimately complies. Wooten, however, denies that she was responsible for her husband's death.

Doctor’s prescription was always the same: antibiotics!\nSugar, soda and sweets played a significant role in Jill’s diet along with cereal grains, rice and potatoes. Jill craved sweets, snacked constantly and ate often. She was always, cold, as well.\nConstipation, gas and bloat were common for Jill. As puberty approached [age 12], asthma-like symptoms began to present, but the trigger(s) were never identified. Instead, Jill was told to use an inhaler and was given steroids.\nWhen Jill’s menstrual cycle began, she suffered amenorrhea [irregular periods] sometimes skipping several months. When they did occur, heavy cramping and severe pain were accompanied by extended bleeding of 7-14 days.\nThe dermatologist put Jill on the usual treatment of tetracycline for acne. Jill saw improvement, but after a few months, the problem returned followed by a persistent bronchial cough low energy and weight gain. Soon thereafter, Jill’s menstrual cycle included problematic, tender, lumpy breasts [fibroid tumors] and occasionally, cysts on her ovaries.\nIn her senior year of high school, Jill lost interest in school and her grades tumbled. Also, she suffered from explosive anger and did NOT get along with her parents. Instead, she found comfort among those with similar problems.\nJill’s behavior became a serious problem made worse by unpredictable anxiety attacks. Her mother took Jill to a psychiatrist who diagnosed her, schizophrenic and bi-polar and put her on psychotropic drugs. Now, Jill suffered the social stigma of being a mental case.\nAt age 18, Jill became sexually active and began using birth control pills. She attended community college for a while, did poorly, was unhappy and drank regularly.\nBirth control pills caused Jill’s menstrual and hormonal issues to compound in the form of chronic bladder and vaginal infections [so-called], heavy depression, imaginary voices and intense anxiety. Jill was given more antibiotics and additional drugs for her problems.\nJill married at age 20 and became pregnant soon after. The pregnancy was difficult. [When her daughter was born, the child suffered from oral thrush, colic, and earache. The child was given antibiotics. Vaccinations made matters worse. Like Jill, the little girl had learning problems at school and suffered from so-called, attention deficit disorder (ADD).\nJill’s diet was heavy in carbohydrates and sugar; sodas and fruit juice were staples. Both Jill and her husband drank. Jill favored wine; she had been told [wrongly!] that it was healthier.\nBy age 40, Jill was overweight, depressed and on occasion, suicidal. She was always sick, her energy was poor and she suffered from constant brain fog and poor memory. Ringing ears [tinnitus] was ongoing and nighttime urination interfered with Jill’s sleep.\nBy age 48, Jill’s health was in shambles. Jill had been betrayed!\nSymptoms NOT recognized for what they are become THE MISSING DIAGNOSIS. Jill’s story is a classic example of defective medical models that are based on symptoms instead of cause!\nHad Jill’s UNDERLYING issues been correctly diagnosed, her life could have been VERY different. Jill suffered from misdiagnosis and lack of guidance. FUNGAL INFLAMMATION ruled Jill’s life!\nA recurring theme in Jill’s story is systemic inflammation and antibiotics.\nBowel disorders, gas and bloat are side effects of yeast infestation and leaky-gut.\nBirth control pills were the final straw needed for MASSIVE mold and fungus invasion.\nJill’s Betrayal Is Our Betrayal, as well!\nThe medical system betrayed Jill [and the rest of us!] Their model is defective partly because of “standards of care” that shackle practitioners and limit freedom of choice.\nJill’s struggle with weight and acne, depression, acid reflux, brain fog [poor memory], mental confusion, allergies, hair loss, chemical sensitivities and low energy were driven by systemic take-over by molds and fungi; particularly, Candida albicans.\nWithout knowledge and guidance and a valid medical model, Jill could not help herself. Her betrayal is an example of sick-care at its best. The mold dilemma confronts all of us. Either, we self-educate or we get in line. You must choose.\nThe Case Study Model is a great way to learn. I will be using this model extensively in future issues of Special Insights on various topics of interest to readers. Each case will profile, identify and analyze the controlling factors behind people’s health issues and needless suffering.\nMost health problems manifest over time; some present all at once. Regardless, when they announce, the ability to identify and understand the contributing factors is invaluable.\nFirst: identify the controlling factors. Second: understand how the problem came to be [trauma, iatrogenic [doctor/medication induced], progressive degeneration, etc.] Third: stop the problem from progressing further. Fourth: reverse the process.\nYou will need ASSISTANCE with the Case Study approach whether a layman or a practitioner. The medical model is incomplete and problems cannot be solved when CAUSE [etiology] is misunderstood.\nHealth issues that repeat over and over in a population, translate, Cause Unknown! Proof is all around us. Diagnosis based on symptoms [arthritis, gout, cancer, kidney and liver issues, asthma, fibroids, thyroid, etc.] is useless because symptoms are effects, NOT cause.\nThe Case Study Model requires your active involvement. Self-help is one of few remaining freedoms we have left. I trust the reader will exercise this freedom, as opposed to getting in line for more of the same, otherwise known as, sick-care.\nFungi were the causative agents behind most, if not all, of Jill’s symptoms. And, behind them are the pharmaceutical drugs that promote fungal growth and take-over.\nFungal invasion of the body’s vital organs is predictable considering the ubiquitous nature of CHEMICAL TRIGGERS such as antibiotics, birth control pills, hormone replacement and corticosteroids. Mold spores are in water, food and air. While unavoidable, they only pose a threat when they activate, hatch and reproduce. Otherwise, spores are DORMANT.\nAlcohol is a mycotoxin activator. Alcohol [including wine!] feeds growth of fungal spores in the body. Autoimmune symptoms are side-effects of mycotoxin made inside the body by fungi. Autoimmune problems are confirmation of fungal infestation and mycotoxin activity.\nIntestinal leakage occurs when fungi sink their roots (hyphae) into the intestinal wall. [Gluten intolerance and chemical sensitivity are side effects; so are bowel disorders of every stripe. Once fungi dominate, autoimmune problems multiply as mycotoxin take control of the system.\nWould probiotics have solved Jill’s intestinal issues? No! Her gas and bloat issues, allergies, chemical sensitivities and leaky-gut problems have their origin in hyphae invasion of the mucous membrane lining of Jill’s intestinal, gut wall.\nWhat about diagnostics, such as: mammogram, prostate biopsy, colonoscopy and physicals unsuspecting patients volunteer for? Sick-care treats test results, NOT PATIENTS! Defective tests are behind the word, misdiagnosis. Without identifying cause, cure is impossible.\nYour author cannot think of a single condition of dis-ease that is untouched by fungal take-over and mycotoxin control of vital organs and hormones. To put these thoughts in perspective, know that fungal infestation of the body is called, CANCER! Read it again!\nOtto Warburg received the Nobel Prize in science in 1931 for his discovery that the fungus called, cancer thrives on sugar [both dietary and metabolic] in an acidic, terrain environment.\nWarburg’s discovery preceded antibiotics, steroids, hormone replacement and birth control pills by 20-30 years. Cancer is a drug induced crisis that is unrelated to your genes. Medications and poor lifestyle choices compound fungal disruption of body metabolism.\nTo better understand our fungal dilemma, review Special Insights, Cause Unknown!, as well as, Cancer, Acidity, Fermentation & pH and the Mold & Fungus Protocol.\nReversion of fungi to their dormant, [non-active!] spore forms, requires understanding of the dynamics involved. Fungal infestation is a component of everyone’s life. Do not ignore it!\nYou must ask for guidance!\nWoe be unto anyone who cannot discern symptoms from cause. Ignorance is the basis of fear, and understanding is the basis of health and happiness.\nThis entry was posted in Special Insights on June 22, 2017 by John Thomas.\n\n Mary Giordano (Alicia Silverstone) is a beautiful and intelligent Catholic-school senior in Burlingame, California.

Its importance lies in the fact that this border is marked in part by the Paraguay River and, as a result, Bolivia has a water route to the Atlantic Ocean that does not involve Brazil. Consequently, Bolivia is planning on building a major port at the Puerto Busch within the triangle. Currently Bolivian ships must pass along the eleven kilometre Tamengo Canal which connects Laguna Cáceres to the Paraguay River at the Brazilian city of Corumbá.\n\n Guaporé River (Rio Guaporé, Río Iténez) is a river in western Brazil and northeastern Bolivia. It is 1260 km long; 920 km of the river forms the border between Brazil and Bolivia. The Guaporé River is part of the Madeira River basin, which eventually empties into the Amazon River. The Guaporé River crosses the eastern part of the Beni savanna region. It forms the border of the 615771 ha Guaporé Biological Reserve, and is fed by rivers originating in the reserve, the São Miguel, Branco, São Simão, Massaco and Colorado. About 260 fish species are known from the Guaporé River basin, and about 25 of these are endemic. While many fish species in the river essentially are Amazonian, the fauna in the Guaporé also has a connection with the Paraguay River (part of the Río de la Plata Basin). The Guaporé and the Paraguay, while flowing in different directions, both originate in the Parecis plateau of Brazil. Among the fish species shared between these rivers are the black phantom tetra (important in the aquarium industry) and golden dorado (important in fisheries).\n\n The Humid Chaco lies in the lowlands of the Paraná river and its tributaries, including the Paraguay River. It is bounded on the west by the Dry Chaco, a semi-arid region of dry forests and savannas. The Alto Paraná Atlantic forests lie to the east, and the Cerrado grasslands to the northeast. It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paraná flooded savanna along the lower Paraná and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers. The topography is generally flat or gently rising, and the soils are mostly fine alluvium deposited by the area's rivers. Asuncion, Paraguay's capital, lies in the ecoregion.\n\n north-ward to the Tapajos and Amazon, and southward to the Paraguay and Paraná rivers. The Mamore is interrupted by rapids a few miles above its junction with the Beni, but a railway 300 km long has been undertaken from below the rapids of the Madeira. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm3/sec (2,530 cub. in. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km2 (9,382 square miles). An extensive pre-Columbian civilization existed in the basin of the Mamore River in the swampy area known as the Llanos de Moxos.\n\n American States (OAS) reports that between 2016 and May 2018, 4,738 Venezuelans arrived in Paraguay. However, the interim general director of Migrations, Ángeles Arriola, said these Venezuelans do not reside in Paraguay. Paraguay is bounded by Bolivia to the northwest and north, Brazil to the northeast and east, and Argentina to the southeast, south, and west. Asunción is located on the east bank of the Paraguay River, opposite the mouth of its primary western tributary, the Pilcomayo River. The Paraguay River, which runs from north to south, divides Paraguay into two distinct geographic regions—the Región Oriental (Eastern Region) and the Región Occidental (Western Region), also called the Chaco Boreal. In January 2019, The General Directorate of Migrations registered having granted temporary filings to Venezuelan citizens with 746 being permanent. It was estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 Venezuelan citizens were based in Paraguay.\n\nQuestion: where does the paraguay river start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The painting inspired Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's Liberty Enlightening the World, known as the Statue of Liberty in New York City, which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after Liberty Leading the People was painted. The statue, which holds a torch in its hand, takes a more stable, immovable stance than that of the woman in the painting. An engraved version of part of the painting, along with a depiction of Delacroix, was featured on the 100 franc note from 1978 to 1995. The painting has had an influence on classical music. George Antheil titled \n\nThe Liberty Bell is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The bell was commissioned from the London firm of Lester and Pack in 1752, and was cast with the lettering (part of Leviticus 25:10) \"Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.\" In the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies, who dubbed it the \"Liberty Bell\". It acquired its distinctive large crack sometime in the early 19th century—a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835. ; Statue of Liberty The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, designed \n\n Oppresso Liber. The subtitle, traditionally translated as \"to free the oppressed\", is the motto of the Green Berets, who inspired the monument. A piece of steel from the original World Trade Center is embedded in the base. It is the first public monument to honor United States special forces. The $750,000 cost of statue was donated by hundreds of private citizens, including some survivors of the September 11 attacks. The statue was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero. On September 13, 2016, the statue was rededicated once again on an elevated space on the south side of Ground Zero within Liberty Park.\n\n The statue, entitled Liberty Enlightening the World, was a gift from the people of France to mark the American Centennial. It was agreed that the Congress would authorize the acceptance of the statue by the President of the United States, and that the War Department would facilitate its construction and presentation. The construction of the statue was completed in France in July 1884. The cornerstone was laid on August 5, 1884, and after some funding delays, construction of the pedestal was finished on April 22, 1886. The statue arrived in New York Harbor on June 17, 1885, on board the French frigate Isère, was stored for eleven months in crates waiting for its pedestal to be finished, and was then reassembled in four months. On October 28, 1886, the Statue of Liberty was unveiled by President Grover Cleveland. The name Liberty Island was made official by Congress in 1956.\n\n The Statue of Liberty, which can be found on Liberty Island in New York, is a very well-known sculptural art piece depicting a woman holding a torch with her hand raised in the air. The sculpture was built in 1886 and stands 93 metres tall, representing freedom and welcoming immigrants who arrived by boat to the USA.\n\nQuestion: where was the statue of liberty originally built\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If a national anthem is defined by being officially designated as the national song of a particular state, then La Marseillaise, which was officially adopted by the French National Convention in 1796, would qualify as the first official national anthem. The Olympic Charter of 1920 introduced the ritual of playing the national anthems of the gold medal winners. From this time, the playing of national anthems became increasingly popular at international sporting events, creating an incentive for such nations \n\n The anthem was performed for the first time for the ceremony of opening of the first edition at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In the following years, every hosting nation commissioned to various musicians the composition of a specific Olympic hymn for their own edition of the games. The anthem by Samaras and Palamas was declared the official Olympic Anthem by the International Olympic Committee in 1958 at the 54th Session of the IOC in Tokyo, Japan. The anthem was performed in English at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley and since then it has been played at each Olympic Games: during the opening ceremony when the Olympic flag is hoisted, and during the closing ceremony when the Olympic flag is lowered.\n\n The Olympic Hymn (Ολυμπιακός Ύμνος, Olympiakós Ýmnos, ), also known informally as the Olympic Anthem, is a choral cantata by opera composer Spyridon Samaras (1861–1917), with lyrics by Greek poet Kostis Palamas. Both poet and composer were the choice of the Greek Demetrius Vikelas, who was the first President of the International Olympic Committee.\n\n The trio who sung the Olympic Hymn in Greek was criticised by both the media and the audience. They were Singaporean soprano Khor Ai Ming, Singaporean tenor William Lim and Japanese soprano Satsuki Nagatome. The trio sung with gusto just before the announcement of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Guardian reported on their operatic rendition \"Two Singaporean sopranos and a tenor dressed like a maître d' subjected the Olympic anthem, a tune whose primary virtue is to be heard only once every four years, to a fearful mauling.\" The Times of the UK described them as \"three Orientals... one distinctly off key\".\n\nQuestion: what language is the olympic anthem sang in\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Jones sailed the captured Serapis to the Dutch United Provinces for repairs. Though Bonhomme Richard sank after the battle, the battle's outcome was one of the factors that convinced the French crown to back the colonies in their fight to become independent of British authority.\n\n On 23 September 1779 and Countess of Scarborough were escorting the Baltic fleet home when they encountered a small Franco-American squadron under the command John Paul Jones in USS Bonhomme Richard (1765), and including the frigates USS Alliance (1778) and USS Pallas (1778). Bonhomme Richard, and sporadically Alliance, engaged Serapis, ultimately capturing her. Countess of Scarborough sailed to engage Pallas, which was armed with 32 guns. The battle with Pallas lasted some two hours. After Countess of Scarborough had sustained much damage and suffered heavy casualties, Piercy observed another frigate coming up on her larboard quarter; Piercy then surrendered. In the battle, Countess of Scarborough lost four men killed and 20 men wounded, three of whom later died. All her braces, the great part of the running rigging, and her main and mizen top-sail sheets were shot away. Also, enemy fire had dismounted seven of her guns. At the onset of the action the merchant vessels separated. Most took shelter near Scarborough. Two went to Hull.

Most of the Upper Mississippi goes through the center of the Driftless Area, around 15,000 square miles in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois that has managed to stay free of glacial flows covering the past two million years. The Driftless Area is defined by a multitude of limestone bluffs that have been molded all the way since the last ice age, due to water melting from glaciers. The bottom of the river is composed of a thin layer of clay, silt, loam, and sand, which lay above a stratum of glacial outwash. The Upper Mississippi River covers approximately half of the Mississippi River's length. About 850 miles of the river is navigable, from Minneapolis-St. Paul to the Ohio River. The river sustains a large variety of aquatic life, including 127 species of fish and 30 species of freshwater mussels.\n\n The Allegheny River is a 325 mi long headwater stream of the Ohio River in western Pennsylvania and New York, United States. The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the \"Point\" of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio \n\n  The Lower Mississippi River is the portion of the Mississippi River downstream of Cairo, Illinois. From the confluence of the Ohio River and Upper Mississippi River at Cairo, the Lower flows just under 1000 miles (1600 km) to the Gulf of Mexico. It is the most heavily travelled component of the Mississippi River System.  Unlike on the upper rivers, there are no locks or dams on the Lower Mississippi. The river is, however, constrained by levees and dikes to control flooding and secure a navigation channel for barges.

Both rivers, as well as the bluffs, played an important role in the Vicksburg Campaign, a pivotal event of the American Civil War. ; The Missouri River flows into the Mississippi River at Jones-Confluence Point State Park, just north of St. Louis, Missouri. Slightly further upstream, the Illinois River flows into the Mississippi. ; The Madison, Jefferson and Gallatin Rivers in Three Forks, Montana form the confluence of the Missouri River. ; At Keokuk, Iowa, the Des Moines River flows into the Mississippi. This forms the political tripoint between the U.S. states of Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois. ; Just south of Cairo, Illinois, the Ohio River flows into the Mississippi, forming the tripoint between \n\n The Ohio River runs 981 miles (1582 km) long, starting at the meeting of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; ending in Cairo, Illinois, where it then flows into the Mississippi. The Ohio River drains portions of eight states, including, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. The river has the capacity to provide enough water for over five million people. At its widest point, it is one mile wide at Smithland dam. The average depth is 24 feet deep which allows multiple species of fish to live there safely. The water is also home to 150 species of fish ranging from catfish to certain species of salmon and trout. The depth also allows for commerce throughout the river on barges. On average the Ohio River transports over 230 million tons of cargo. Typically, the cargo being shipped are energy resources such as coal. These resources account for 70% of the cargo. Along with shipping energy resources, the Ohio River also creates energy with dams and other power-generating facilities. There are 20 dams and 49 other power generating facilities on the Ohio River.\n\nQuestion: where does the ohio river and the mississippi river meet\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ancient sources provide a wealth of interpretations of Odysseus' wanderings, with a complex range of traditions which affect one another in various ways. Broadly speaking there are two dominant trends. One is that of Euhemerist accounts, which re-wrote mythical stories without their fantastic elements, and were often seen as thereby recovering \"historical\" records. The other reflects the conventions of foundation myths, whereby stories of a city or institution being founded in the course of Odysseus' travels often came to have political significance. Some identifications are common to both groups. The main distinctions between them are in how the identifications were passed down through the generations, and the uses to which they were put. The most standard identifications, which are rarely disputed in ancient sources, are:\n\n left Troy, and to remember his place as a mere mortal. The next morning, Odysseus washes ashore and is found by some Phaeacians girls. With help from Phaeacian King Alcinous (Jeroen Krabbé), they help Odysseus back to Ithaca. They deliver him at night while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. Upon awakening the next morning, he finds himself on Ithaca where is reunited with Telemachus. Using a peasant disguise provided by Athena, Odysseus meets up with Penelope where she decides to hold a contest to find the person who can string Odysseus' bow. After Odysseus wins the contest, Athena lifts his disguise and Odysseus is assisted by Telemachus in slaying Eurymachus and the suitors. Once the suitors are dead, Odysseus is finally reunited with Penelope.\n\n  In Book 9 of the Odyssey, Odysseus describes to his hosts the Phaeacians his encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus. Having just left the land of the Lotus-eaters, Odysseus says \"Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes\". Homer had already (Book 6) described the Cyclopes as \"men overweening in pride who plundered [their neighbors the Phaeacians] continually\", driving the Phaeacians from their home. In Book 9, Homer gives a more detailed description of the Cyclopes as: \"an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich \n\n and other geological changes over thousands of years can alter the landscape and seascape to the point where identification may be extremely difficult. The geography of the Apologoi (the tale that Odysseus told to the Phaeacians, forming books 9-12 of the Odyssey), and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of Scheria, pose quite different problems from those encountered in identifying Troy, Mycenae, Pylos and Ithaca. For these reasons, the opinions of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously. It has repeatedly been argued that each successive landfall, and the routes joining them, are real and can be mapped; it has been argued with equal conviction that they do not exist in the real world and never can be mapped.\n\n In Odyssey 8, Odysseus lands on the island of the Phaeacians. During Odysseus' time there, the Phaeacians stage a series of athletic contests for Odysseus so that he could spread stories about the Phaeacians' athletic prowess. First, the Phaeacians competed in a foot race. Following the foot race, the Phaeacians battled each other in a fierce wrestling competition. After wrestling, the Phaeacians held jumping and boxing contests. The fifth and final event was the discus throw. After the discus competition, Odysseus is invited to show his athletic skills, but he declines the offer. After declining the offer, one Phaeacian, Euryalos, joked that Odysseus did not have the skills to compete in an athletic competition. This infuriated Odysseus. The angered Odysseus then grabbed a discus much larger and heavier than the ones used by the Phaeacians, and he swung back and released the discus. The discus landed well clear of the Phaeacians' earlier marks. Odysseus then challenged the Phaeacians to other athletic competitions, which they declined.\n\nQuestion: where do the phaeacians live in the odyssey\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has been suggested that glass eye covers in hieroglyphs from the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2686–2181 BC) were functional simple glass meniscus lenses. Similarly the so-called Nimrud lens, a rock crystal artifact dated to the 7th century BC, may have been used as a magnifying glass or may have been a decoration. The earliest written record of magnification dates back to the 1st century AD, when Seneca the Younger, a tutor of Emperor Nero, wrote: \"Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through \n\n (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). Galileo greatly improved upon these designs the following year. Isaac Newton is credited with constructing the first functional reflecting telescope in 1668, his Newtonian reflector. The earliest known examples of compound microscopes, which combine an objective lens near the specimen with an eyepiece to view a real image, appeared in Europe around 1620. The design is very similar to the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the Netherlands including claims it was invented in 1590 \n\n globe or glass filled with water\". Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the gladiatorial games using an emerald as a corrective lens. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) wrote about the effects of pinhole, concave lenses, and magnifying glasses in his 1021 AD Book of Optics. The English friar Roger Bacon's 1260s or 1270s written works on optics, partly based on the works of Arab writers, described the function of corrective lenses for vision and burning glasses. These volumes were outlines for a larger publication that was never produced so his ideas never saw mass dissemination. Between the 11th and 13th century \"reading stones\" \n\n Zacharias Janssen and/or his father, Hans Martens,  claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, and claims it was invented by expatriate Cornelis Drebbel who was noted to have a version in London in 1619. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name \"microscope\" was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625.\n\n invented. Often used by monks to assist in illuminating manuscripts, these were primitive plano-convex lenses initially made by cutting a glass sphere in half. As the stones were experimented with, it was slowly understood that shallower lenses magnified more effectively. Around 1286, possibly in Pisa, Italy, the first pair of eyeglasses were made, although it is unclear who the inventor was. The earliest known working telescopes were the refracting telescopes that appeared in the Netherlands in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: Hans Lippershey applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by Jacob Metius of Alkmaar two weeks \n\nQuestion: who invented the glasses that give sight to the blind\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sleet occurs when snowflakes partially melt as they fall through a layer of warm air and then refreeze before reaching the ground. This results in tiny ice pellets that bounce upon impact. Sleet often forms during winter precipitation events when there is a temperature inversion, causing a shallow layer of warm air above the freezing layer near the ground. It is important to note that sleet is distinct from freezing rain, which occurs when raindrops freeze upon contact with a surface that is below freezing temperatures.\n\n cut off power connections and paralyze travel over large regions. ; Squall – Sudden onset of wind increase of at least 16 knots (30 km/h) or greater sustained for at least one minute. ; Thunderstorm – A thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates both lightning and thunder. It is  normally accompanied by heavy precipitation. Thunderstorms occur throughout the world, with the highest frequency in tropical rainforest regions where there are conditions of high humidity and temperature along with atmospheric instability. These storms occur when high levels of condensation form in a volume of unstable air that generates \n\n typically cloud particles collide and fall out of the sky as precipitation. Even though precipitation can fall in many forms and in many locations, most precipitations either ends up back into a body of water or on land as surface runoff. A portion of runoff enters back into streams and rivers, which over time lead back to the ocean. Another portion of runoff soaks into the ground as groundwater seepage, and are stored in freshwater lakes. The other portion of runoff soaks into the ground as infiltration, some of this water will infiltrate deep into the ground and replenish aquifers.\n\n Fronts are the principal cause of significant weather. Convective precipitation (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air. If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, \"roll clouds\" and tornadoes may occur. In the warm season, lee troughs, breezes, outflow boundaries and occlusions can lead to convection if enough moisture is available. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward to the east of mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.\n\n  In meteorology, the different types of precipitation often include the character or phase of the precipitation which is falling to ground level. There are three distinct ways that precipitation can occur. Convective precipitation is generally more intense, and of shorter duration, than stratiform precipitation. Orographic precipitation occurs when moist air is forced upwards over rising terrain, such as a mountain. Precipitation can fall in either liquid or solid phases, or transition between them at the freezing level. Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle and dew. Rain or drizzle which freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass gains the preceding adjective \"freezing\", becoming known as freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, ice crystals, ice pellets (sleet), hail, and graupel. Their respective intensities are classified either by rate of fall, or by visibility restriction.\n\nQuestion: what are the four main types of precipitation\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, a permanent member's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. This veto power does not apply to \"procedural\" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors. The veto power is controversial. Supporters regard it as a promoter of international stability, a check against military interventions, and a critical safeguard against US domination. Critics say that the veto is the most undemocratic element of the UN, as well as the main cause of inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity, as it effectively prevents UN action against the permanent members and their allies.\n\n The Security Council had eleven seats, filled by five permanent members and six non-permanent members. Each year, half of the non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms. A sitting member may not immediately run for re-election. Candidates must reach a required two-thirds majority to be elected to the United Nations Security Council.\n\n dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia was recognised as the legal successor state of the Soviet Union and maintained the latter's position on the Security Council.  At the UN's founding in 1945, the five permanent members of the Security Council were the French Republic, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There have been two seat changes since then, although these have not been reflected in Article 23 of the United Nations Charter, as it has not been accordingly amended:  Additionally, France reformed its provisional government into the French Fourth Republic in 1946 and later into the French Fifth Republic in 1958, both under the leadership of Charles de Gaulle. France maintained its seat as there was no change \n\n The UN currently has five permanent members with veto power in the Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – comprising the victors of World War II. The G4 nations are regularly elected to two-year terms on the Security Council as non-permanent members by their respective regional groups: in the 24-year period from 1987 to 2010, Brazil and Japan were elected for five terms each, Germany for four terms (one term as West Germany and three terms as unified Germany) and India for four terms. Cumulatively, the G4 has spent 64 years on the Security Council since the UN's inception, with each country serving at least a decade.\n\n  The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five sovereign states to whom the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The permanent members were all allies in World War II (and the victors of that war), and are also all states with nuclear weapons (though only the United States had developed nuclear weapons prior to the formation of the United Nations). The remaining 10 members of the council are elected by the General Assembly, giving a total of 15 UN member states.

The discovery of achondroplasia can be credited to a group of scientists led by Dr. John Wasmuth in 1994. They found that achondroplasia results from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) gene, located on human chromosome 4. This mutation affects the formation of cartilage, resulting in severely shortened bones.\n\nAchondroplasia shares similar presentations with other congenital conditions such as achondrogenesis, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, and osteogenesis imperfecta. It also has genetic similarities to thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. However, each of these conditions has distinct characteristics and diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe prevalence of achondroplasia is estimated to be approximately 1.3 per 100,000 live births. It affects both males and females, with female patients having an average height of 4 feet and ½ inches (123 centimeters) and male patients having an average height of 4 feet and 3½ inches (131 centimeters).\n\nDiagnosis of achondroplasia can be done using prenatal ultrasound, which can detect its presence during pregnancy. A DNA test can help identify homozygosity, and a skeletal survey can be used to diagnose the condition. The signs of achondroplasia include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base, and narrow foramen magnum.\n\nIt's important to note that as of now, there is no definitive cure for achondroplasia. Treatment mainly focuses on managing symptoms and providing necessary support. Ongoing medical care and genetic counseling are essential for individuals with achondroplasia and their families.\n\n LB1's height is estimated to have been 1.06 m. The height of a second skeleton, LB8, has been estimated at 1.09 m based on tibial length. These estimates are outside the range of normal modern human height and considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the smallest modern humans, such as the Mbenga and Mbuti at 1.5 m, Twa, Semang at 1.37 m for adult women of the Malay Peninsula, or the Andamanese at also 1.37 m for adult women. LB1's body mass is estimated to have been 25 kg. LB1 and LB8 are also somewhat smaller than the australopithecines, such as Lucy, from three million years ago, not previously thought to have expanded beyond \n\nHypochondroplasia is a form of short-limbed dwarfism. This condition affects the conversion of cartilage into bone (a process called ossification), particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs. Hypochondroplasia is similar to another skeletal disorder called achondroplasia, but the features tend to be milder.\nAll people with hypochondroplasia have short stature. The adult height for men with this condition ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches). The height range for adult women is 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet, 2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches).\nPeople with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood. Some studies have reported that a small percentage of people with hypochondroplasia have mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, but other studies have produced conflicting results.\nThe incidence of hypochondroplasia is unknown. Researchers believe that it may be about as common as achondroplasia, which occurs in 1 in 15,000 to 40,000 newborns. More than 200 people worldwide have been diagnosed with hypochondroplasia.\nAbout 70 percent of all cases of hypochondroplasia are caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Although it remains unclear how FGFR3 mutations lead to the features of hypochondroplasia, researchers believe that these genetic changes cause the protein to be overly active. The overactive FGFR3 protein likely interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth that are characteristic of this disorder.\nIn the absence of a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, the cause of hypochondroplasia is unknown. Researchers suspect that mutations in other genes are involved, although these genes have not been identified.\nHypochondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most people with hypochondroplasia have average-size parents; these cases result from a new mutation in the FGFR3 gene. In the remaining cases, people with hypochondroplasia have inherited an altered FGFR3 gene from one or two affected parents. Individuals who inherit two altered copies of this gene typically have more severe problems with bone growth than those who inherit a single FGFR3 mutation.\nCohen MM Jr. Some chondrodysplasias with short limbs: molecular perspectives.

Epub 2011 Nov 16. Review.\n\nPrimarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, achondroplasia is one of the common causes of dwarfism. Individuals suffering from this medical condition usually have short stature. For female patients, the average height is 4-feet and ½-inches or 123 centimeters. On the other hand, the average height for male patients is 4-feet and 3½-inches or 131 centimeters. Aside from highly valuable information like symptoms, causes and treatments, it is also nice to know something about its history including who discovered achondroplasia.\nWho discovered achondroplasia? A group of scientists led by Dr. John Wasmuth discovered the cause of achondroplasia in 1994. According to their findings, this type of dwarfism resulted from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene, which is part of the human chromosome 4. Today it affects at least one in every 25,000 live births.\nIn terms of epidemiology, achondroplasia is similar to many other congenital conditions such as achondrogenesis, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda and osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition, it also shares similar presentations with other diseases like thanatophoric dysplasia as well as osteoporosis. Based on a number of studies, its prevalence is only 1.3 per 100,000 live births.\nWhen the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene 3 undergoes autosomal dominant mutation, the cartilage formation of patients is greatly affected. This will then lead to severely shortened bones. Two other diseases have similar genetic basis, namely thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia.\nIn terms of diagnosis, it is very much possible to detect the presence of achondroplasia with the help of prenatal ultrasound. To help identify if there is homozygosity, one must undergo a DNA test. It is also possible to use a skeletal survey to diagnose the problem. The signs include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base as well as narrow foramen magnum.\nAs of the moment, no one has yet to find any proven treatment against this medical condition. Good thing there are certain procedures available that can somehow enhance the overall appearance of patients. One of these is limb-lengthening surgery. The shortest person ever recorded with this condition was Jyoti Amge of India, who only stands at 58-centimeters or 23-inches tall and weighs around 5-kilograms or 11-pounds.\nThe other visible signs and symptoms of this disease are hypotonia or low muscle tone and slow motor movement. Most of the time, individuals suffering from this medical condition are obese, mainly because of their short stature. For children, otitis media and other middle ear infections are always a problem, all of which are caused by their abnormal skull structure.\nWho Discovered the Cure for Chicken Pox?\nWho Discovered Treacher Collins Syndrome?\n\n The average head-and-body length of the male is 55 cm, with a range of 46 to 68 cm, while the female averages 52 cm with a range of 41 to 55 cm. In some regions, no difference in size is seen between males and females. The tail is about 30 cm long in both sexes. The height at the shoulder is 25 to 30 cm. On average males weigh 3.5 kg, with a range of 3.2 to 9.4 kg, while females average 2.9 kg, with a range of 1.4 to 3.2 kg.\n\nQuestion: what is the average height of a chinese man\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They are typically used to align components and measure deflections in optical or mechanical systems. An autocollimator works by projecting an image onto a target mirror and measuring the deflection of the returned image against a scale, either visually or by means of an electronic detector. A visual autocollimator can measure angles as small as 1 arc-second (4.85 micro-radians), while an electronic autocollimator can have up to 100 times more resolution. Visual autocollimators are often used for aligning laser rod ends and checking the face parallelism of optical windows and wedges. Electronic and digital autocollimators are used as angle measurement standards, for monitoring angular movement over long periods of time and for checking angular position repeatability in mechanical systems. Servo autocollimators are specialized compact forms of electronic autocollimators that are used in high-speed servo-feedback loops for stable-platform applications. An electronic autocollimator is typically calibrated to read the actual mirror angle.\n\n  An eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a type of lens that is attached to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. It is so named because it is usually the lens that is closest to the eye when someone looks through the device. The objective lens or mirror collects light and brings it to focus creating an image. The eyepiece is placed near the focal point of the objective to magnify this image. The amount of magnification depends on the focal length of the eyepiece. An eyepiece consists of several \"lens elements\" in a housing, with a \"barrel\" on one end. The barrel is shaped to fit in a special opening of the instrument to which it \n\n length f at the distance 2f from that image plane and then put an image sensor at 2f beyond that lens, that lens will relay the first image to the second image with 1:1 magnification (see thin lens formula showing that with object distance ). Ideally, this second image is the mirror image of the first image, so you could put an image sensor there and record the mirrored first image. If a longer distance is needed, this can be repeated. In practice, the lens will be an achromatic doublet. In modern optical telescopes and telescopic sights with a dual-focal plane design, the objective image is typically already inverted upon reaching the relay lenses, and thus needed to be inverted again back \n\n The image recorded by a photographic film or image sensor is always a real image and is usually inverted. When measuring the height of an inverted image using the cartesian sign convention (where the x-axis is the optical axis) the value for hi will be negative, and as a result M will also be negative. However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is \"real is positive, virtual is negative\". Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always real and positive. When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are virtual and negative. Therefore, the photographic magnification formulae are traditionally presented as\n\n A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the French mirage, from the Latin mirare, meaning \"to look at, to wonder at\". This is the same root as for \"mirror\" and \"to admire\". Also, it has its roots in the Arabic mirage. In contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can be captured on camera, since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. What the image appears to represent, however, is determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water. Mirages can be categorized as \"inferior\" (meaning lower), \"superior\" (meaning \n\nQuestion: a concave mirror can form a real image which is a copy of an object that forms\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These films focus on the titular character named Kharis (Klaris in the Abbott and Costello film). The Mummy's Hand recycled footage from the original film for use in the telling of Kharis' origins, where Karloff is clearly visible in several of these recycled scenes but was not credited. Lon Chaney Jr. played the Mummy in The Mummy's Tomb, The Mummy's Ghost, and The Mummy's Curse.\n\n Frankstein's full name in the film is Baron Charles Frankenstein, unlike Mary Shelley's Victor Frankenstein or the classic Universal Studios movie's Henry Frankenstein. The dwarf in the film is named Rinaldo, after the name of blacklisted Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein screenwriter Frederic I. Rinaldo, who also wrote the scripts for several Universal films, including Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951); Hold That Ghost (1941); The Black Cat (1941) and The Invisible Woman (1940). Some scenes were shot amidst the statuary at the Gardens of Bomarzo in Lazio, Italy.\n\n Universal Pictures released the last of their horror films in the 1950s. They continued releasing commercially-successful movies with the horror-comedy parodies starring the comedy duo Abbott and Costello, and a few monster movies including the classic Creature from the Black Lagoon. In March 1951, Universal Pictures premiered Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man. The science fiction comedy depicts the misadventures of two private detectives investigating the murder of a boxing promoter. The film was part of a series in which the legendary comedy duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello meet classic characters from Universal's stable, including Frankenstein, the Mummy and the Keystone Kops. The special effects in the movie, which depicted invisibility and other optical illusions, were created by Stanley Horsley, son of cinema pioneer David Horsley. In February 1954, Creature from the Black Lagoon premiered in theaters in 3-D. The film was so popular, it generated two sequels: Revenge of the Creature (1955), and The Creature Walks Among Us (1956). The Creature, also known as the Gill-man, is usually counted among the classic Universal Monsters.\n\n features over the next eleven years, including the first of six feature-length Abbott and Costello comedies starting in 1946 with The Time of Their Lives. In 1948, Barton directed Abbott and Costello in the first of two independently-produced feaures, The Noose Hangs High, for Eagle-Lion Studios, and then, in 1949, Africa Screams for Nassour Studios, marking the only film appearance of Joe Besser and Shemp Howard in supporting roles, each of whom were at one time members of the Three Stooges comedy team. Overall, Barton directed eight Abbott and Costello films, including their last movie as a team, Dance With Me, Henry, in 1956.\n\n Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man is a 1951 American science fiction comedy film directed by Charles Lamont and starring the team of Abbott and Costello alongside Nancy Guild.

The Beast forces the Woodsman to carry and fuel his Dark Lantern, which contains the Beast's soul, under the guise that it contains the soul of the Woodsman's daughter. Throughout the miniseries, the Beast follows Wirt and Greg, trying to turn them into Edelwood trees to fuel his lantern. When the light of the lantern is shined upon the Beast in the final episode of the miniseries, he is revealed to be composed of various grotesque faces, likely from the souls of those he has turned into Edelwood trees.

They are wireless earbud-style headphones with microphones, dual accelerometers, IR sensors used to pause music if they are not in the user's ears, and motion touch sensors that are used to activate controls. They are advertised as having a battery life of five hours, and come with a charging case that gives them a total of 24 hours of battery life. The original case is charged by Lightning, and in 2019 a second case was introduced with Qi charging. AirPods are compatible with iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Macs, the 6th generation iPod Touch, and the 7th generation iPod Nano, but automatic pairing with an iCloud account requires macOS Sierra, iOS 10, and watchOS. They are also compatible with devices on other platforms that support Bluetooth, but it limits the AirPods' functionality.\n\n These are currently the high-end wireless headphones that Beats offers. They connect by Bluetooth and have 40 hours of battery life, with 22 hours of battery life with adaptive noise cancelling on. They feature Apple's W1 chip for quick connection to Apple devices running iOS 10, macOS Sierra, or watchOS 4 or later. They also feature pure adaptive noise cancelling technology, which uses microphones both inside and outside the ear cups to measure sound levels based on the environment. If there is any headgear or eyewear on the user's head, it calibrates the noise cancelling and volume level accordingly. The headphones come in a wide range of colors and editions, including black, blue and special collections such as the \"NBA Collection\".\n\n Monster established a partnership with rap mogul Dr. Dre and Interscope Records in 2007 to design and manufacture the Beats Electronics line of headphones called \"Beats by Dr. Dre\". This led to a trend among headphone manufacturers to create celebrity-endorsed products. Monster created similar partnerships with Lady Gaga for the Heartbeats brand of headphones in 2009, P. Diddy's Diddybeats in May 2010 and LeBron James later that year. In 2010, Monster began developing a series of products for the Chinese market that were co-branded with basketball player Yao Ming. According to analyst firm NPD Group, the Beats brand that Monster distributed \n\n AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds designed by Apple Inc. They were first announced on September 7, 2016 alongside the iPhone 7. Within two years, they became Apple's most popular accessory. They are Apple's entry-level wireless headphones, sold alongside the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. In addition to playing audio, the AirPods contain a microphone that filters out background noise as well as built-in accelerometers and optical sensors capable of detecting taps and pinches (e.g. double-tap or pinch to pause audio) and placement within the ear, which enables automatic pausing of audio when they are taken out. On March 20, 2019, Apple released the second-generation AirPods, which feature the H1 chip, longer talk time, and hands-free \"Hey Siri\" support. An optional wireless charging case which costs extra was added in the offerings. On October 26, 2021, Apple released the third-generation AirPods, which feature an external redesign with shorter stems similar to AirPods Pro, spatial audio, IPX4 water resistance, longer battery life, and MagSafe charging capability.\n\n  Apple bought audio equipment maker Beats Electronics in 2014, which included the ownership of Beats' former music service Beats Music, and made Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers responsible for the iTunes Radio service. Business Insider later reported that Apple was planning to merge the two services. Apple also hired Zane Lowe as a music curator. The day of Beats 1's launch, The Guardian revealed that they had been given pre-recorded examples of Beats 1 programming, and said it \"suggests an eclectic mix of programming to fill the 24-hours-a-day of broadcasting.\" On September 29, 2015, Zane Lowe said he wasn't sure that Apple Music needed Beats 1, but said \"I hope that there's a place for it, however I really doubt it.\" In December 2015, rumors spread that Apple would expand on the Beats 1 brand and give it sister stations, after Apple registered trademarks for four additional Beats stations. \n\nQuestion: when did the first wireless beats come out\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Humes also played various keyboards and provided backing vocals throughout the album, while also arranging several songs. His other highlights on the album include a vocal duet with Howard on the song \"I Can't Wait (to See You Alone)\" and performing all instruments (via the \"Kurzweil 250 Computer Systems\") on the song \"My Friend\".

He originally gained fame when he released his eponymously titled debut solo effort on Atlantic Records in 1988. The album was produced by Monroe Jones and David Tickle, and executive produced by future Interscope founder Jimmy Iovine. Although he had a top 40 hit with \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\" in 1988 and also had a minor hit with \"Drift Away\" from The Wonder Years soundtrack, Spence was dropped from Atlantic before completing his second album in 1991. After several years of struggle, Spence's composition \"The Power\" was covered by both Amy Grant and Cher and was also used for a national Century 21 advertising campaign.

Centred on the disappearance of a young boy, the series stars Peter Coyote, Camille Sullivan, Aden Young, Joanne Kelly and Micheline Lanctôt. It later premiered in the UK on the Universal in February 2018. It premiered in the United States on July 9, 2019 on WGN America. The series was first developed in 2011 as a French language project written by Normand Daneau and Geneviève Simard, but after Productions Casablanca was unable to sell it to any of Quebec's francophone television networks they opted to translate the scripts into English, and were successful in pitching the series to Bell Media. The series was directed by Peter Stebbings. The series received several Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards, including Best Limited Series or Program and Best Actress in a Television Film or Miniseries (Sullivan).\n\n The Vancouver Island South Film and Media Commission (formerly known as the Greater Victoria Film Commission) was originally a committee of the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce until it was spun out into a separate organisation. The Vancouver Island South Film and Media Commission receives financial support from Creative BC and the British Columbia Ministry of Community, Sport, and Cultural Development as well as the Southern Vancouver Island municipalities of: City of Victoria, District of Saanich, District of Oak Bay, City of Langford, City of Colwood, Town of Esquimalt, District of Sooke, Town of View Royal, and District of Highlands. As a non-profit the Vancouver Island South Film and Media Commission has focused on developing the infrastructure required to provide necessary services and talent to the international film and television industry. As part of their efforts to increase film productions in the region they provide free services to production companies such as location scouting, location surveys, script breakdowns, digital location library, and assistance with film and work permits. The Vancouver Island-based organization works to attract film and media productions from around the world.\n\n Production on the pilot began in March 2012 in Vancouver, Canada. The series features two distinct timelines, which requires more specific planning in the filming schedule. Filming for the island flashbacks takes place in Vancouver's Whytecliff Park area, near beachfront homes. The production team is tasked with keeping the buildings out of camera frame. Additionally, producer Marc Guggenheim finds the process arduous: \"Stephen [Amell] has to wear a wig, and his look has to be changed... there's a lot. It's actually incredibly ambitious to do these flashbacks every week, every single episode. Because like Andrew [Kreisberg] said, it's almost like it's its own show.\" Hatley Castle, located in Royal Roads University was used for exterior shots for the Queen family mansion. Hatley Castle had previously been used as the Luthor ancestral home in Smallville. Vancouver's Terminal City Ironworks Complex doubles as the exterior for Queen Consolidated, Inc.\n\n With \"My Struggle\", the series returned to Vancouver, Canada for filming. This marked the first time that the series had filmed an episode in the city since the fifth season finale \"The End\", which aired in 1998. Filming for the episode commenced June 8, 2015. Because most of the episode is set in Washington, D.C., the crew tried to find parts of Vancouver that could \"play\" the aforementioned city. Certain shots were digitally altered, with shots of the United States Capitol Building and the Washington Monument added in post-production. One of the episode's opening scenes is a dramatic visualization of the supposed Roswell crash that took place in 1947. Mark Freeborn, the series' production designer, according to Carter, \"came up with a UFO crash that was so much bigger and better than I ever imagined it would be.\" Art director Shannon Grover noted that \"everyone wanted to see [a] 1950s classic flying saucer\" used in the scene. In addition to a scene featuring a computer-generated version of a saucer crashing, the production crew also created a faux wrecked saucer that was around 50 ft in diameter.\n\n Principal photography for the series began on May 3, 2021, in London, United Kingdom. Filming moved to Marshall, North Carolina on September 24. Production on the series wrapped on November 5, 2021.\n\nQuestion: where did they film the show the crossing\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Brown. The film stars Paul Newman and Lee Marvin and takes place in 1970s Arizona and northern Mexico. The song \"Pocket Money\" is composed and performed by Carole King. It was mostly filmed in the small town of Ajo, Arizona. Portions of the film were shot at Southwestern Studios in Carefree, Arizona, a facility originally built by cast member Fred Graham. According to co-star Wayne Rogers, in an episode of Pop Goes the Culture, Newman and Marvin did not get along especially well during production.

Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Usually the child recovers without complications. It used to be one of the classic childhood diseases. However, it has become much less common since the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine.\nOnce a child has had chickenpox, as have most of the adults of my age who lived before the time of the chickenpox vaccine, the virus usually remains dormant, or asleep, in the body for a lifetime. About 1 in 10 adults will experience the virus emerge, for some unknown reason but usually during a period of stress, as shingles.\nWhile it usually isn't a life-threatening condition, shingles can be very painful. Shingles can occur anywhere on your body, but it most often appears as a single stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or the right side of your torso. It can also appear on your face, I know because that's where my shingles appeared, on the left side of my nose and face.\nAsk anyone who has had shingles and they won't talk about the rash. They won't talk about the blisters. They will talk about the pain. For some unfortunate individuals the pain continues past the rash. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. The pain can last for months or years.\nBitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. It isn't gone just because the rash has cleared up.\nThen later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over.\n\"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32).\nHe knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others.\nLet us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us.\ncomplicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. Many of the systems will not allow you to use a password you have ever used on that system before.\nThis is not a problem for me except for one program, the one we use to print patient labels. For some reason I can never remember my password to that program. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. It has even become a running joke between the two of us. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. In fact, I just had to email her the last night I worked to once again reset me.\nOur preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. In fact, when we do so, we are communicating that we are in the perfect position. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\"\nSo let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\"\n\". . .let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\"\nfrom experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. I have watched many women working hard to deal with the pain of contractions and then later working even harder pushing with them.\nThen the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. The labor is gone and the baby is birthed in it's place.\nAs we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves.\nLet us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\"\nHave hope, there are great days ahead!\n\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\"\nis amazing how far and how bright this flashlight shines. I carry it with me everywhere. It does a wonderful job of illuminating the darkness even at a distance.\nI thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\"\nHe continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. . .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus.\nIt also illuminates. It allows us to see the power of the Lord in our lives working out His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus.\nThe three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God.\nIf we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it.\nfront. That's not too unusual a sight, except this fence was only the strip along the front of the yard. There were no sides to the fence and no gate.\nNow a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show.\nThis dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. When we do things \"for the Lord\" sometimes they can be like that piece of picket fence. It looks good on the outside, but it has no true function. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence.\nand have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"\nand thy neighbour as thyself.\"\nI have pondered this often. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How often is my motive the love of God and the love of neighbour and how often is it something else? How often is it to be well-thought of, or to be thought of as a \"good person\"?\nHow many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society?\nMay we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves.\nfor the 1200+ mile trip.\nOur youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. They will fly. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well.\nMy husband and I have always wanted to take a train trip, so we are using this opportunity to ride the train for 25 hours. I hope it will be as pleasurable as we anticipate.\nOur son has not yet decided how he will arrive, but I doubt he will drive.\nRegardless of our method of transportation, we each have one thing in common: we have a destination. In our case, we have the same destination. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Even if you plan to enjoy the journey, as we do with the train ride, the main point is to get somewhere.\nOur lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It will be too late when the train pulls into the station, or when the plane lands on the tarmac to change your mind.\nIt really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. . .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God.\nChoose wisely. Choose today. You are already on your journey and no one knows when your train is pulling into the station.\nThe Valley of the Shadow. . .\nI have long pondered this Psalm, especially the phrase, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.\"\nThe thing which strikes me about it is what it doesn't say. It doesn't say \"through the valley of death.\" David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death.\nFor those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\"\nNot only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite.\nThe moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet.\nThe mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior.\nOur dear friend Larry tells the story of his father's recent passing to Heaven. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? Can it be this easy?\"\nWhen my own father died, a close friend called the next morning. His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" There was nothing better that could have been said. An easy move to a far better neighborhood!\nSo let us have hope and not fear that passage before us. As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" We will have an easy, glorious journey home.\nand to be present with the Lord.\"\nRainy Days and Mondays. . .\nThis past Monday was a dark, grey rainy day. My husband and I were traveling down the road and I commented about the color of a particular road sign. My husband thought I said \"sun\".\nHe laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said.\n\"Whether we can see it or not, I have it on great authority that the sun is still there,\" was my reply.\nThat statement is so true. No matter how dark the clouds or storm makes the day, we know the sun is still there. It hasn't ceased to be. Why do we know it is there? Because it has always been there, every morning, every day for as long as we, or anyone else for that matter, can remember. We have total and complete faith in the sun that it will continue to come up every morning and set every evening.\nThe Lord our God is and has been eternal, He has always been and will always be exactly what He is and He will never do anything which contradicts His nature and character.\nWe can have faith that our Lord will always be for us in every situation exactly what we need Him to be, that He will always be working out His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus in our lives and that He is always for us. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning.\nI have seen many \"glimpses of love\" in my lifetime. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have watched as mother, and father, cry and joy over their new child.\nI have seen glimpses of love between my grandchildren. Jackson is only a year older than Emma, but he is in every way the \"big brother\". He is always watching out for her and taking care of her. If she is upset, he is there to comfort her. If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting.\nThis past Saturday we took Emma for her very first ballet class. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. As soon as we walked through the door of the studio, she ran into the room and began dancing to the music in her head. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. Finally he moved away from the window and watched her on the big screen television above the window. It was only halfway through the class before he realized she was going to be ok that he finally relaxed. Watching Jackson, I was glimpsing love.\nI see glimpses of love in the cup of coffee my husband so faithfully brings me every morning.\nDuring the Olympics we saw glimpses of love when a winning athlete would run into the arms of a mother or father for a long and tearful embrace.\nDon't we enjoy seeing things like this? Don't they warm our heart and sometimes even bring tears to our eyes? Why is that?\nIt is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. . .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive.\nSo somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6).\nWe live in a sub-tropical location, and our city is the only seaport in our state. Mobile sits on the edge of the fourth largest estuary in the United States.\nThe Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. Fish River runs into the bay from the eastern side. Our city has 118 miles of land area and 41 miles of water area.\nNot only do we have water all around, but we have water from above, too. A 2007 study determined that Mobile is the wettest city in the contiguous 48 states, with 66.3 inches of average annual rainfall over a 30-year period.\nOur elevation above all that water is between 10 and 200 feet, depending upon where you live. All this tends to make our weather not only hot, but humid, making it feel even hotter than it is by the thermometer.\nBut today it is 76° outside and tomight the temperature will get down to 68°.\nFor the Deep South in the middle of September, that is a wonderful thing. The slight coolness of the air, that hint of crispness in the morning, is the hope of something yet to be. You see, we don't really have \"winter\" as much of the country experiences winter. Snow is a rare, but celebrated thing here. More than \"winter\" we have an absence of summer, a respite from that heat and humidity.\nSo these cool mornings and evenings are a hope of things yet to be. They are a promise of what will come.\nFeeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. We have been given a whole book of promises of \". . .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13).\nLet us avail ourselves of the promises that have been set before us, to give us hope and comfort regarding those things yet to be. As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4).\nAs as we feel the cool morning that is a promise for the relief from summer heat, let it lift our hearts that there is a time coming when the heat of our hearts will be lifted as well. Let us have hope. . .\"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5).\nToday is my only granddaughter Emma's fifth birthday.\nEmma is a beautiful, curious, talented little girl with the energy of five five-year-olds. When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue.\nI guess it was inevitable with a nickname of \"Frannie\" that when I became a grandmother I would be called \"Grannie Frannie.\" Although I have highly encouraged the dropping of the \"Grannie\" part, both the rhyme and my name is now set forever in the minds of my grandchildren.\nEmma seems to start every sentence with \"Grannie Frannie. . .\" Sometimes I think I hear that name a thousand times in a weekend.\nI confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. Only I'm not really alone, I still have to converse with Emma through the bathroom door where she waits for me to come out.\nI am so glad our Lord doesn't ever go somewhere to \"be alone\" and find a respite from our constant calling Him. Instead, the Scriptures tell us \". . .the prayer of the upright is His delight,\" (Proverbs 15:8).\nNot only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). How wonderful to know that our voices are never old to Him, that He never wearies with our calling of His name. What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe.\nEmma's little voice is sweet to me, too. Especially when she says as she did this weekend, \"You are the best Grannie Frannie I've ever had! I love you, Grannie Frannie!\"\nI truthfully responded, \"I love you, too, Emma. You are the best granddaughter I've ever had!\nNothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity.\nEvery interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. We are either helping others to know the Lord more or helping them to forsake Him and His Word. We are either encouraging them in their walk with the Lord or hindering their renewing of their fellowship with the Lord.\nOur contact is not neutral. We are either a positive or negative pole of the magnet. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell.\nThat may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds?\nHave you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Maybe they let you in front of them in busy traffic. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact.\nLet me tell you about Irene.\nslowly he knew he had plenty of time to go back and get it. I had been called into work on my day off, had just gotten off and was tired. Very tired. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster.\nAn older woman behind me started talking to me. Basically a shy person, I'm not one to strike up a conversation with strangers too much -- that's what my husband does. But I answered her questions: Did I just leave work? Did I work at a hospital? Was I a nurse?\nHer attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. . .warm, sweet and irresistible. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. By the time we checked out, we felt as if we had known her forever. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. She had been a positive influence, encouraging me in my walk with the Lord.\nWe all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. . .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever.\nLet us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. But we are there for one purpose, to share the love of the Lord Jesus in some way, shape or form. Let us not lose the opportunities that abound around us.\nduring football season. But an interesting thing besides football happened on that field while we were there.\nSouth Alabama was playing Nicholls State from Thibodaux, Louisiana and one of their players was injured. We waited as the trainers attended him but when the cart wheeled onto the field we realized it might be more serious that just a pulled muscle or a cramp.\nIt was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. They motioned for the Nicholls State players on the field to join them and together the two teams prayed for the wounded player.\nThe crowd was clearly moved. Quiet, respectful applause went up as they prayed and at the end of the prayer the applause grew to a loud ovation. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. . .no matter which uniform he was wearing.\nBefore he was wheeled away to the hospital, the player on the cart waved to the fans to let them know he was better than we thought and again applause erupted from the stands.\nIt is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others.\n\"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\"\nYesterday I looked up at the sky to see an airplane cruising by. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. . .I wonder if that plane will actually land or will it crash?\nSometimes I wonder if people have forgotten that horrible morning of September 11, 2001.\nFor some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land.\nOn the day when 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in America, 1609 people lost a spouse or partner. More than 3,051 children lost parents.\nNot all of those who died were Americans, either. There were 327 foreign nationals killed from 53 countries. No wonder this attack shook the world.\nThe United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. I remember one of the most touching scenes to me during that time was when the Star Spangled Banner was played at Buckingham Palace. The tribute to the United States by our closest friend and ally brought tears to my eyes...it still does eleven years later.\nFor this attack which killed more people than the attack on Pearl Harbor, let us pledge to never forget those who died that day. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. Let us remember their honor and sacrifice.\nAs the mother of a police officer, and as a nurse, I understand that sense of duty. The life of service does not stop because one has clocked out. Stories abound of off-duty firefighters and police officers who threw their equipment into whatever conveyance they could find and made it somehow to Ground Zero. Many who did so never returned.\nWe have a great land. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew.\nlet all the people praise Thee.\"\nIn the 1960's the Andy Griffith show used to feature commercials in which the characters of the show would act out endorsements of various products. Somewhere during the commercial, Andy would pronounce the product as \"Gooood.\" His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. The thought was, I suppose, if Andy said it was that \"gooood\" then it had to be really good.\nThis is not an exhaustive list of course, but just gives us an idea of how full the Scriptures are of proclamations of the goodness of God. Or as Andy Griffith would have said, \"He's real goooood!\"\nWhen someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. The Lord our God is the one Person in whom we can put our faith and trust and know we will never, NEVER be let down or disappointed. In fact, He will be for us \"abundantly above all that we ask or think.\"\nWe can trust Him because He IS good.\nAs I wake from my four hour nap after a long night shift, I am naturally contemplating the concept of rest.\nThere are times when our bodies are so tired we long for rest. Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\"\nI remember at the end of my pregnancy with our youngest daughter Emmie, I was working full time at a busy University Center Labor & Delivery. At that time we were doing just under 400 deliveries a month, there were no \"slow days.\" Since I knew when our repeat C-Section was scheduled, sometimes I would close my eyes and think, \"In X-number of days, I'm going to be in the hospital, and I'm just going to sleep!\"\nOf course, I knew it wasn't going to happen that way. Loving family, supportive friends and dutiful nurses flowed in and out of my hospital room at all hours. A beautiful newborn wanted to nurse every couple hours as well. There was little sleep. The first night, someone came in my room for some reason or other at least every hour during the night. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order!\nThe Lord desires us to rest in Him. He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep.\nShe knew her mother's voice. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. There is none we can trust more surely than the Lord Jesus. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. There is no safe haven apart from Him. He has not left us and He will never forsake us. If that be the case, what have we to fear, of what cause is there to worry? The Lord of Heaven and earth holds us in His very hands. . .we can rest.\nI often find that my badge, or name tag, at work has flipped around so that my name and title is not visible. Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was.\nThere had been some issues right about the time the patient was to begin pushing regarding which family members should be in the room. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue.\nAfter the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Then he asked her about me, \"Is she a charge nurse or something?\"\nRobbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\"\nIt reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" His courage defeats them and they pack up and leave.\nBarney's badge represented the authority of his position. . .it represented \"bigger people\".\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is the express image of God...He is the earthly expression of God the Father and God the Spirit. His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus.\nsat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. Everyday he would go out and check on his tomato plants.\nHe watered them. He fed them. He would remove the little suckers at the bottom of the plants, he would check for insects on the plants. He would look for blooms and later tomatoes.\nWhen the tomatoes came, he covered the plants with netting to prevent the birds and the squirrels from helping themselves to a meal. He could tell you at any given time how many tomatoes were on the vines. If a plant became weighted down with it's fruit, he would make sure it was well staked and supported. If a tomato became split or damaged, he would remove it lest it damage the whole plant.\nBasically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes.\nIn the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. We are the branches which grow upon the True Vine. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son.\n\"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19).\nIf we are weighted down, He provides His Word and fellow Christians around us to be the support to help lift us up and encourage us.\nWe don't have to be concerned with the fruit produced in our lives. If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing.\nI was born on Labor Day. I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse.\nMy trek to Labor and Delivery was in every way unexpected. First of all, I never expected to be a nurse. I had other plans. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher.\nA few weeks before I was to leave home I decided I just didn't want to go. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\"\nNow, I had never wanted to be a nurse, had never planned to be a nurse, had never prepared to be a nurse. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I had not taken Chemistry in high school and I would need it to get into nurses' training.\nI couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. I couldn't take it in night school either. My only choice was to take it in college. Ouch!\nBut this is how the Lord works. I had joined the chorus in college and loved it. I took Chemistry in the accelerated session between the Spring and Summer semester. Another ouch! But my professor was one of the choral directors! At least I had a friend in my instructor.\nWhen he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry.\nThe next fall I started the nursing program and graduated without any problems, even though falling in love during that time presented a huge distraction. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. A few days before I graduated one of my classmates came up to me and said, \"They have straight day positions open in Labor & Delivery if you want one!\"\nTo this day I can still remember my answer, \"Why would anyone want to work in Labor & Delivery?\"\nGod has a sense of humor, doesn't He?\nI worked in the Cardiac department of that hospital for three months by the calendar and three years by how it felt to me. Then I transferred to USA Medical Center to work in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where I worked for five years.\nDuring that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors.\nI also put in a transfer for Labor & Delivery.\nI have now worked in Labor & Delivery for twenty-nine years. I have been in about 2800 deliveries. It has been the most incredible blessing to witness the miracle of birth over and over again -- and each time it is indeed a miracle. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent!\nNever could I have imagined my life would have taken the turns it has, and as I reflect on the wisdom of our God on this Labor Day, I can only thank and praise Him for His leading in my life. I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense.\nO give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever.\"\nToday I am fifty-five. I now qualify for the senior coffee at McDonald's with a free refill, too! That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. Before the day is over, I plan to stop by there just to order my coffee!\nIt feels I have gotten here way too soon. The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. Each Christmas couldn't come fast enough. Then I got married and a couple of years later, the babies started coming.\nThe pace of time sped up. It reminds me of a ride on a roller coaster. Those first 50 feet or so just crawl along. Then the roller coaster takes it's first plunge and after that it only seems to go faster and faster. I am on that roller coaster.\nAt this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. Your life is more than half over. Then the frightening thought begins.. . \"I haven't done most of the things I wanted to do yet!\" It reminds me of the opening of an old soap-opera: \"Like sands through the hourglass so are the Days of our Lives.\"\nThis is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. \"This is how long you have left to live!\"\nBut if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Our hourglass is never-ending, sort of like that endless cup of coffee of McDonald's.\nYes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. We will know no end. One day we will simply breathe out the air of this earth and breathe in the sweet fragrance of our Lord. And \"so shall we ever be with the Lord.\"\nSo when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead.\n\n We were apart during the spring, when everything feels young, even aged Saturn; however, none of the beauty I saw around me could bring me into sympathy with my surroundings. I could not admire the lily or the rose, since these were to me only images of you. Thus, it still seemed winter to me, since you were away.\n\n in blacks and reds.

It shows Tanya performing the song against a rose-colored background and a black background, as well as a storyline involving a couple in three time periods in an apartment bedroom. First, the young woman walks to an open window as the man comes through to see her. She gives her flowers, which she puts on the nightstand. The next scene shows them as now parents with two kids (one of which is a newborn) playing around on the bed. The man sees the woman is tired and tries to talk to her, but she just lets it go. She is then seen kissing the now dressed man. The final scene shows the couple as now elderly and living in the same apartment. The woman is first seen reading as the man comes in. He picks up his glasses and a newspaper and sits beside her. The man is then seen in bed; she comes over and kisses him and they smile at each other. It ends with a dedication to Tanya's parents (Beau and Juanita), who celebrated their 50th anniversary the year the video was made.\n\n I criticized the violet, telling it that it had stolen its sweet smell from my beloved's breath, and its purple color from my beloved's veins. I told the lily it had stolen the whiteness of your (that is, the beloved's) hands, and marjoram had stolen the beloved's hair; a third flower had stolen from both; in fact, all flowers had stolen something from the person of the beloved.\n\nQuestion: who says that which we call a rose\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Through Max Perutz, his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King's College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helical structure in a paper in the journal Nature in April 1953. In this paper Watson and Crick acknowledged that they had been \"stimulated by.... the unpublished results and ideas\" of Wilkins and Franklin. The first Watson-Crick paper appeared in Nature on 25 April 1953. The members of the Cambridge \n\nWatson and Crick are well-known for their significant contribution to the discovery of the helical structure of DNA. In 1953, they proposed a model in which DNA forms a double helix, consisting of two strands that are twisted around each other. This breakthrough in understanding the architectural arrangement of DNA proved to be a crucial milestone in the field of molecular biology. Furthermore, their model provided substantial insights into the replication and transmission of genetic information. By unraveling the structural foundation of DNA, Watson and Crick laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology.\n\nIt is fascinating to note that their work was heavily influenced by the research of other renowned scientists, such as Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. Franklin, through her X-ray crystallography studies, revealed crucial information about the molecular structure of DNA. Although Franklin's contributions were not fully acknowledged at the time, her data played a pivotal role in guiding Watson and Crick towards their groundbreaking discovery. Overall, the collaboration between Watson and Crick, coupled with insights from other scientists, led to the unveiling of the double helix structure of DNA, revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and paving the way for numerous scientific advancements.\n\n  From the very early stages of structural studies of DNA by X-ray diffraction and biochemical means, molecular models such as the Watson-Crick nucleic acid double helix model were successfully employed to solve the 'puzzle' of DNA structure, and also find how the latter relates to its key functions in living cells. The first high quality X-ray diffraction patterns of A-DNA were reported by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in 1953. Rosalind Franklin made the critical observation that DNA exists in two distinct forms, A and B, and produced the sharpest pictures of both through X-ray diffraction technique. The first calculations of the Fourier transform of an atomic helix were reported one year earlier \n\n had a helical structure. Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing the model of the proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was \n\n knowledge that Linus Pauling had proposed an incorrect structure of DNA, \"mobilised\" Watson and Crick to restart model building. With additional information from research reports of Wilkins and Franklin, obtained via Max Perutz, Watson and Crick correctly described the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953. Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA. Wilkins, Crick, and Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nQuestion: who proposed the first accurate model of dna\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After the regular season, Bradford captured the Davey O'Brien Award and the Heisman Trophy, awarded to the best player in college football. He is the second sophomore, after 2007 winner Tim Tebow of the University of Florida, to receive the Heisman; he also became the fifth University of Oklahoma player, as well as the second person of Native American descent to capture the trophy after Jim Plunkett. Bradford received 1,726 total points while the other finalists, Colt McCoy, of the University of Texas, and Tim Tebow, received 1,604 and 1,575, respectively. Tebow, however, collected more first-place votes, 309, while Bradford got 300. Bradford got the most points thanks to the help of his 315 second-place votes. A \n\n In the first road game of the season, Tennessee suffered its first loss of the season at the hands of the fourth ranked Oklahoma Sooners. The young offensive line was overwhelmed the whole night by the much more experienced Sooner defense as they sacked Justin Worley five times (not including one that was negated by a face mask penalty), intercepted two balls in the end zone, including one that was returned 100 yards for a touchdown, and recovered a fumble. \"We improved in some areas, but when you go on the road against a quality opponent like Oklahoma you can't turn the football over\", Butch Jones said. \"A game can come down to two or three plays and you never know which plays are going to make a difference.\" During the time between Oklahoma and Georgia, Coach Jones announced that freshman running back Treyvon Paulk had been dismissed from the team for a \"personal conduct\" issue. He did not elaborate further.\n\n His academic excellence led him to Princeton University, where he played for the Tigers from 2009 to 2013. In 2009, recorded 34 tackles, most among all Princeton freshmen, and added 4.5 tackles for loss, four pass breakups and a sack. In 2010, Reid played in only one game before suffering a season-ending injury. In 2011, he earned first-team All-Ivy League honors after leading all Ivy League linemen with 68 tackles, including 29 solo stops. He led Princeton in tackles for loss (16), sacks (eight), pass breakups (three), quarterback hurries (three) and blocked kicks (three). In 2012, he earned third-team FCS All-American honors by the Associated Press, after recording 40 tackles, including 9.5 for losses, 5.5 sacks and three blocked kicks. He also earned unanimous first-team All-Ivy League honors on the defensive line. In 2013, he was named a finalist for the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year honors. He earned his third straight first-team All-Ivy League honor, only the fourth player in Princeton history to earn the honor three times. He recorded 26 tackles, including 11 for loss, 6.5 sacks, one interception and one blocked kick.\n\n Westbrooks began his college career at San Joaquin Delta College where he played defensive end ending his freshman season with 12 sacks. He later transferred to Sacramento City College where he played defensive end and earned All-league honors All-conference accolades and All-state in 2011. He transferred to West Texas A&M where he was recognized as Lone Star Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year in 2012. Westbrooks had an outstanding first season in a Buffalo uniform as he played in all 15 games with 14 starts on the defensive line. He had 60 total tackles with 29 solo stops and led the team and conference with 28 tackles for loss for 139 yards. He led the team, the league, and the nation in sacks with a school-record 19.5 sacks for 116 yards. He had two pass breakups and a team-high 19 quarterback hurries, while forcing three fumbles. As a senior in 2012 with opponents keying in on him, Westbrooks numbers dropped significantly in 2013 with 43 tackles, 19.5 for losses, and seven sacks. He was selected to the 2014 East–West Shrine Game, and earned Defensive MVP honors during the game with two sacks and two more tackles for loss.\n\n Norwood arrived at South Carolina in 2006 and immediately made an impact at the Defensive End position. In 13 games as a Freshman, he recorded 30 total tackles (9.0 for loss), 7.0 sacks, and 5.0 quarterback hurries. For his efforts, Norwood was named First Team Freshman All-American and All-SEC by The Sporting News. His 7.0 sacks tied for the team-lead, while his 5.0 hurries were tops for the team. In 2007, Norwood asserted himself as one of the most effective Defensive Ends in college football. In 12 games, he recorded 69 total tackles (19.5 for loss), 6.0 sacks, 9.0 quarterback hurries, and 3 fumble recoveries.

However, the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance has worked to increase funding for ovarian cancer research, with the goal that this funding will support breakthroughs to help detect ovarian cancer early, treat it more thoroughly, and allow women with ovarian cancer to survive, and thrive. The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance has worked to ensure that necessary treatments are covered by Medicare; that drugs and tests on the market are safe and effective; and that federal policy makers are aware of the importance of the ovarian cancer community.\n\n The National Center for Health Research (formerly the National Research Center for Women & Families) is a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization founded in 1999. It uses objective, research-based information to encourage new, more effective programs and policies that promote the health and safety of women, children, and families. The center educates patients, consumers, and health professionals through its articles, trainings, and media, and educates policymakers and analysts about the latest research at briefings, hearings, and meetings. The President of the National Center is Diana Zuckerman. The primary program is The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund, which has an online health hotline and provides free, research-based information and services to patients and their families. In 2014, the think tank changed its name from the National Research Center for Women & Families to the National Center for Health Research.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) plays a crucial role within the United States government in addressing cancer-related issues. As part of the National Institutes of Health, which is under the umbrella of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the NCI serves as a federally funded research and development center. It is one of eight agencies that make up the Public Health Service.\n\nThe primary responsibility of the NCI is to coordinate the National Cancer Program. This program aims to support and conduct cancer research, promote prevention and early detection strategies, provide comprehensive information on cancer, and offer resources for healthcare professionals and patients. The NCI coordinates efforts across various sectors including academia, industry, government agencies, and non-profit organizations to advance our understanding of cancer and improve patient outcomes.\n\nTo fulfill its mission, the NCI operates large intramural research programs at two locations: Bethesda, Maryland and Frederick, Maryland (NCI-Frederick at Fort Detrick). These programs focus on conducting cutting-edge research in various areas related to cancer biology, treatment modalities, prevention strategies, and supportive care.\n\nAdditionally, the NCI provides funding to support cancer researchers throughout the United States. By investing in innovative projects conducted by scientists across different institutions and disciplines, they aim to drive progress in cancer research.\n\nIn summary, the National Cancer Institute plays a vital role within the United States government by coordinating the National Cancer Program. Through its intramural research programs and funding initiatives for external researchers nationwide, it contributes significantly to advancing our knowledge of cancer and improving approaches for prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.\n\n SEER began collecting data on cancer cases on January 1, 1973, in the states of Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, and the metropolitan areas of Detroit and San Francisco-Oakland. By 2001 the program included information on major population centers in Georgia, Washington, Louisiana, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Alaska, California, Kentucky. This includes specific Native American populations in Arizona, Alaskan Natives, and Hispanic populations in California. National Cancer Institute funds for the program are combined with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the National Program of Cancer Registries and with funding from the involved states. NCI staff work with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) to guide all state \n\n disease orientation and categorical structure of the IRP had its genesis in the establishment of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1944. In 1948, Congress passed the National Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, and soon after established institutes for research on mental health, oral diseases, neurological problems, and blindness. Today, the IRP consists of individual programs housed in 23 of the NIH Institutes and Centers, creating a network of multi-disciplinary, federally funded laboratories with an emphasis on translational research. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, the world's largest clinical research hospital, is designed to foster smooth transitions between laboratory work, patient studies, and bedside cures, facilitating the translation of laboratory findings to new approaches for the prevention and cure of human diseases.\n\nQuestion: when did congress passes legislation to fund the national cancer institute\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As of December 2013, there were 21 states with minimum wages above the Federal minimum, with the State of Washington the highest at $9.32. Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. A smaller increase to $9.00 per hour would reduce employment by 100,000, while about 7.6 million workers would have higher pay.\n\n ''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the Senate on November 19, 2013. This is a public domain source.'' S. 1737 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour, and to adjust the wage annually thereafter to account for inflation. In addition, the bill would increase the federal minimum cash wage for workers who receive tips by gradually raising that wage until it equals 70 percent of the federal minimum wage for other workers. Finally, S. 1737 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2016 an increased limitation on the amount of investment that firms can immediately deduct from their taxable income—a limitation that mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses.\n\n  Advocates of raising the minimum wage assert this would provide households with more money to spend, while opponents recognize the impact this has on businesses', especially small businesses', ability to pay additional workers. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families. The New York Times editorial board wrote in August 2013: \"As measured by the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is lower paid today than at any time in modern memory.

Frost has published several collections of poetry, and has held several teaching residencies. Frost is the founder and director of the Catskill Poetry Workshop at Hartwick College. Her work has featured in four Pushcart Prize anthologies. Frost was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, and later graduated from the State University of Oneonta and Syracuse University after studying at the Sorbonne in Paris. Frost has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and is the winner of Pushcart Prizes. Frost's poetry has been praised for its \"protean layers of observation\" and her “encyclopedic approach to subject matter.” Frost writes in intensive bursts of at least three weeks after spending not writing for several weeks or months. After her bursts of writing she likes to walk or go sailing. As a teacher Frost has been in residence at the Vermont Studio Center and taught at Washington University's Hartwick College and Wichita State University. Frost has also been a visiting poet at University of Wollongong in Australia.\n\n Wright's poetry is rooted in a sense of place and time and often employs distinct voices in dialogue, particularly those of the American South. Her work is formally inventive and often documentary in spirit, in the sense that it honors those whose stories or voices might be lost, were it not for her own writing. Her diction mixes high and low to surprising effect, and her range of reference is both broad and deep, including phrases from other languages, allusions to other poems, and pieces of conversation. Her books include precisely distilled lyrics such as those collected in Tremble as well as book-length poems beginning \n\n After the Cowmans returned to the United States in January 1918, Charles' health continued to decline. As he suffered in pain, Lettie suffered, watching her husband slowly fade away. During this time, her best-selling devotional book, Streams in the Desert, was conceived. Lettie wrote a daily devotional based on her hardships and her experiences of fellowship with God. Each daily section contains a Bible passage and a quote from another author. The title of the book comes from Isaiah 35:6, \"Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.\" No one expected Streams to be as successful as it was. Cowman was not seeking success during the time she wrote it. When the book was being printed, her publisher was certain they would never publish more than the original printing of 3,000. Yet, many readers found they could connect with Streams because it \"spoke to those who had difficulty relating their own sufferings to the noble and eternal purposes of a loving and all-wise God.\" Cowman often stated, \"I did not write Streams. God gave me Streams.\"\n\n Welch's famous poem inspired other works. Contemporary Christian artist Wayne Watson recorded a song by the same name, with lyrics adapted to the music based on this poem. The song was written by John Kramp in 1974 while a freshman at Baylor University and recorded for Wayne Waston's first album Workin' In The Final Hour in 1980 and recorded 12 years later on his How Time Flies compilation project. A short film also titled The Touch of the Master's Hand won the Short Film Jury Award – U.S. Fiction at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n Crossing the Water is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by Sylvia Plath that was prepared for publication by Ted Hughes. These are transitional poems that were written along with the poems that appear in her poetic opus, Ariel. The collection was published in the United Kingdom by Faber & Faber (1975) and in the United States by Harper & Row (1976). The poems here, mostly written between 1960 and 1961, tend to dwell on one's state of being in an environment. \"Wuthering Heights,\" for example, details a walk that Plath takes along the Yorkshire moors where Emily Brontë once trekked, Finisterre is a stormy island where Plath and her family once visited and \"Among the Narcissi\" describes Plath's similarities at being among asexual vegetation.\n\nQuestion: who wrote put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th and current president. The office of president was created when India became a republic on 26 January 1950, when its constitution came into force. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected. Although Article 53 of the Constitution of India states that the president can exercise his powers directly or by subordinate authority, with few exceptions, all of the executive powers vested in the president are, in practice, exercised by the prime minister (a subordinate authority) with the help of the Council of Ministers. The president is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet as long as the advice does not violate the constitution.\n\n West Bengal is a constituent state of the Republic of India, with local executives and assemblies- features shared with other states in the Indian federal system. The president of India appoints a governor as the ceremonial representative of the union government. The governor appoints the chief minister on the nomination of the legislative assembly. The chief minister is the traditionally the leader of the party or coalition with most seats in the assembly. President's rule is often imposed in Indian states as a direct intervention of the union government led by the prime minister of India. Each state has popularly elected members in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha. The state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial president of India. The former president of India, Pranab Mukherjee, was a native of West Bengal and a leader of the Indian National Congress. The two major political forces in the Bengali-speaking zone of India are the Left Front and the Trinamool Congress, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress being minor players.\n\n India has a parliamentary system as defined by its constitution, with power distributed between the central government and the states. The President of India is the ceremonial head of the country and supreme commander-in-chief for all defence forces in India. However, it is the Prime Minister of India, who is the leader of the party or political alliance having a majority in the national elections to the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is the leader of the executive branch of the Government of India. The Prime Minister is the chief adviser to the President of India and the head of the Union Council of Ministers. India is regionally divided into States (and Union Territories) and each State has a Chief Minister who is the leader of the party or political alliance that has won a majority in the regional elections otherwise known \n\n Both the houses of the state legislature jointly nominate Members of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha or Council of States is the upper house of the Parliament of India. Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President of India can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members sit for staggered six-year terms, with one third of the members retiring every two years.\n\n The Rajya Sabha, also known as the Council of States, is the upper house of India's Parliament. Candidates are not elected directly by the citizens, but by the Members of Legislative Assemblies and up to 12  can be nominated by the President of India for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members of the Parliament in Rajya Sabha get a tenure of six years, with one-third of the body facing re-election every two years.

Soon after Bhutto came to assume control of Pakistan, he made his move to establish the nuclear weapons development. On January 20, 1972, Abdus Salam, after being requested by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, arranged and managed a secret meeting of academic scientists and engineers, in Multan city, to meet with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who assumed the control of his country shortly after the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 and the Bangladesh Liberation War. It was here that Bhutto orchestrated, administrated, and led the scientific research on nuclear weapons as he announced \n\n Roy a lifetime federal minister for his loyalty to the government in Islamabad during the war. Roy headed a delegation from Pakistan to oppose Bangladesh's application to join the United Nations. The government of Bangladesh, under Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, sent its own delegation to New York to apply for admission led by Tridev Roy's mother Rajmata Benita Roy. Roy joined the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto during the 1970s. Bhutto offered Roy the position of President of Pakistan once he became Prime Minister of Pakistan.

The park was named in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), a French statesman who served as a volunteer under General George Washington in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. The land was part of the St. Louis Common. When the Common was divided in 1836, an ordinance preserved the 29.95 acres for public use as a park. It was separated from the Commons in 1844 but it wasn't until 1851 that it was formally dedicated as Lafayette Square, the name that became associated with the neighborhood that grew up around the park. The park was renamed Lafayette Park in 1854. It also has cannons that were part of a British warship that bombarded Ft. Moultire in Charleston Harbor in June, 1776 during the Revolutionary War. The guns were placed in the park by the Missouri Commendry of the American Legion. In 1972, Lafayette Square was declared a historic district by Saint Louis. It has a few walking and biking trails, a duck pond with fountain, children's playground, various decorative plantings, and a gazebo that can be rented for picnics and events.\n\nComte de Rochambeau – A French aristocrat, soldier, and a Marshal of France who participated in the American Revolutionary War. ; General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname leading 1,350 Continental Army troops in a surprise attack against the 544 man British garrison at Stony Point. ; Henry Lee III – An early American patriot who served as the 9th Governor of Virginia and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 19th district.

French forces left Rhode Island in June 1781 and joined Washington's force on the Hudson River the following month. In August, the combined American and French armies headed south, marching through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, a route that allowed them to evade British troops. They reached Williamsburg, Virginia, in late September 1781, several weeks after the French royal fleet had won the Battle of the Chesapeake, preventing the British from reinforcing or evacuating General Cornwallis's army. On September 22, they combined with troops commanded by the Marquis de Lafayette. A three-week siege of Yorktown led to Cornwallis's surrender on October 19, 1781.

It's a novel combination of bird, pig and human viral genes never before found in the U.S. or elsewhere, so people have no immunity to it. It's a descendant of the H1N1 virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide in the pandemic of 1918-1919, mixed in with recent strains of swine and bird flu viruses. The 1918 virus originated in birds and then jumped to humans. This year's virus apparently jumped from a pig to a 5-year-old boy in Veracruz, Mexico, who passed it on to other humans.\nQ. What does H1N1 stand for?\nA. It's the initials of two sugar proteins (their scientific names are hemagglutinin and neuramidinase) that sit on the surface of the virus and do its dirty work. There are 16 types of the H protein, numbered H1 through H16, and 9 types of the N protein, numbered N1 through N9. That makes 144 possible combinations of the virus, a constantly changing challenge for prevention or treatment. A new combination, H2N2, cause a brief swine flu epidemic in 1957. An H3N2 strain was the source of another epidemic in 1968. The bird flu virus that is began in Southeast Asia a decade ago and has spread throughout the Old World is an H5N1 combination.\nQ. How does the H protein work?\nA. The H protein looks like a little spike that fits into a notch, called a receptor, on the outside of an animal or human cell and lets the virus enter. Once inside, the virus hijacks the DNA in the cell's nucleus and uses it to make copies of itself.\nQ. What does the N protein do?\nA. After infection, it opens a passage in the cell wall and releases the new baby viruses, which can now invade other cells. Without the N protein, infection would be limited to the first cell, rarely enough to cause disease.\nQ. How do medicines such as Tamiflu and Relenza work?\nA. They block the action of the N protein so the virus can't spread. They're not vaccines to prevent an infection, but drugs to limit its impact. They should be taken as soon as possible since the virus reproduces most rapidly between 24 and 72 hours after illness begins.\nQ. How does a new virus develop?\nA. When the genes that govern the H and N proteins reproduce, random changes — mutations — can occur in their DNA. The changes gradually accumulate, ultimately producing a virus that may be more lethal or may penetrate a target cell more easily. Another possibility is gene-swapping. This can happen when a cell is infected by viruses from different creatures, say a chicken and a pig. The cell becomes a \"mixing bowl,'' whipping up a new virus containing some chicken genes and some pig genes. In the new strain of H1N1 virus, pieces of human, bird and pig genes are all scrambled up.\nQ. How does this H1N1 virus differ from the H1N1 that caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919?\nA. That virus developed various changes over the years, so it's similar but not identical to its ancestor — like a grandson who resembles but also differs from his grandfather. So far, H1N1 is not as virulent as the previous strain, but that could change. The earlier pandemic began mildly in 1918, but returned in a devastating second wave six months later. Experts fear that could happen again. Hence they are rushing to develop a vaccine by this fall.\nQ. How does H1N1 virus jump from animals to humans?\nA. Usually the H protein on a pig or bird virus doesn't fit easily into the receptor of a human cell. So a person exposed to such a virus is unlikely to get infected. However, random changes may occur in the genes that control the shape of the H protein and allow the virus to pass through the cell wall. This gives rise to a new strain of H1N1 that's adapted to humans. Now the virus can pass from person to person, as is happening now. Contact with infected pigs or birds no longer is necessary.\nQ. How does one person catch H1N1 from others?\nA. The virus can be transmitted through the air — by a cough or a sneeze — or by a handshake or by touching an infected surface, such as a doorknob. The virus can live for up to two hours outside a cell. It can't be passed by eating pork.\nQ. Why is this disease seem to be more deadly in Mexico than in the U.S. or other countries?\nA. That may be an illusion. The first U.S. death has now occurred in Texas and more fatalities are expected. It's possible that many cases of mild disease in Mexico went undetected, making the mortality rate appear to be higher there than it does here. It's also possible that the virus strain in the U.S. differs slightly from the one in Mexico, making it less virulent.\nQ. Why does H1N1 seem to attack healthy young adults more than sick and elderly people, who are most affected by the ordinary seasonal flu?\nA. Young adults have a healthy immune system that launches a massive counterattack of antibodies against the flu virus. Unfortunately, the counterattack can cause an overwhelming inflammation that damages other organs, such as the lungs. Elderly people with weaker immune systems are less likely to suffer from such harmful inflammation. Older people who were exposed to earlier flu epidemics might also have some residual immunity in their systems.\n\n also known to have been infected by humans. Humans have been affected since early 2009. The November 27, 2009 worldwide update by the U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 7,820 deaths\". The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, \"opening a new chapter in the global epidemic\". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They \n\n fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association was the first to confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. The association recommended that cat owners with flu symptoms avoid touching cat's eyes, nose, and mouth while sick. They recommended thoroughly washing hands after handling a sick pet as it might be possible for cats to transmit the virus to humans. This was the third confirmed case of H1N1 in a cat in the U.S.; other cases have occurred in Utah and Iowa. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks.\n\nA H1N1 flu is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by the influenza A virus. It causes high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs. Swine influenza viruses may circulate amongst pigs throughout the year. Studies show 30-50% of commercial US swine have been infected with swine flu. The mortality rate is 1-4%.\nSwine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, they do sometimes cross the species barrier to cause disease in humans. The current human swine flu outbreak is caused by the H1N1 subtype.\nWhat are the symptoms in humans?\nThe symptoms are similar to the symptoms of regular human flu and include fever, coughs sore throats, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people have also reported diarrhea and vomiting. In the past, severe illness (pneumonia and respiratory failure) and deaths have been reported with swine flu infections in people.\nHumans can get infected from direct contact or close proximity to infected pigs, so people working in the pig industry are most susceptible, Human-to-human transmissions can also occur. It spreads mainly through coughing or sneezing. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with the swine flu virus on it. (e.g. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze and then touching their mouth or nose before washing their hands.) The virus is thought to able to live approximately 2 hours on surfaces.\nInfected people may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 7 or more days after becoming sick. That means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick, as well as while you are sick.\nSwine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Eating properly handled and cooked pork and pork products are safe. Cooking pork to an internal temperature of 70 degrees Centigrade kills the swine flu virus.\nAlthough the current swine flu does not have a high mortality rate, it is known to be highly contagious. Like all influenza viruses, swine flu viruses change constantly. When influenza viruses from different species infect a single subject, the viruses can reassort (i.e. swap genes) and new viruses that are a mix of swine, human and/or avian influenza viruses can emerge.\nThe concern is if the new virus has a high morbidity and mortality rate (i.e. spread easily person-to-person and have a high death rate) then a pandemic can occur. The disease can cause a global outbreak and can sweep across the country and around the world in very short time.\nHow does it affect Bali?\nInfluenza can spread mainly from person-to-person through coughing and sneezing. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something with flu virus on it (e.g. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze) and then touching their mouths or nose before washing their hands.\nWhat can I do to protect myself from getting flu?\nCover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue ion the trash after use.\nWash your hands with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based cleansers are also effective.\nWhat is the best way to keep from spreading the virus through coughing and sneezing?\nIf you are sick, limit your contact with other people as much as possible. Do not go to work or school if ill. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Put your used tissue in the waste basket. Cover your cough or sneeze if you do not have a tissue. Then, clean your hands and do so every time you cough or sneeze.\nWhat is the best technique for washing my hands or avoid getting the flu?\n\nSwine Humans Birds Other animals Before being transmitted to humans, a H1N1 type virus is known to have circulated in swine. In August 2007, about 25 people and 160 pigs developed flu at a county fair in Ohio. Analysis showed they were infected with the same strain—a H1N1 type containing genes of human, bird and swine origin. A 2004 study found that in Iowa, 20 percent of swine veterinarians and 3percent of meatpackers, but no university workers, had antibodies in their blood indicating they had been infected with swine flu. Another study, of 804 rural Iowans, found that pig farmers were 50 times more likely, and their spouses about 30 times more likely, than university workers to carry swine flu antibodies.

This isotope is preferred over 226Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.\n\n supply energy in the event of a primary power failure. The batteries can be either inside the bottom of the panel or inside a separate battery box installed near the panel. ; Initiating devices: These components act as inputs to the fire alarm control unit and are either manually or automatically activated. Examples would be devices such as pull stations, heat detectors, duct detectors, and smoke detectors. Heat and smoke detectors have different categories of both kinds. Some categories are a beam, photoelectric, ionization, aspiration, and duct. ; Fire alarm notification appliance: This component uses energy supplied from the fire alarm system \n\n Americium-241, an alpha emitter, is used in smoke detectors. The alpha particles ionize air in an open ion chamber and a small current flows through the ionized air. Smoke particles from the fire that enter the chamber reduce the current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm. Radium-223 is also an alpha emitter. It is used in the treatment of skeletal metastases (cancers in the bones). Alpha decay can provide a safe power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators used for space probes and were used for artificial heart pacemakers. Alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay. Static eliminators typically use polonium-210, an alpha emitter, to ionize the air, allowing the 'static cling' to dissipate more rapidly.\n\n The ionization chamber has found wide and beneficial use in smoke detectors. In an ionisation type smoke detector, ambient air is allowed to freely enter the ionization chamber. The chamber contains a small amount of americium-241, which is an emitter of alpha particles which produce a constant ion current. If smoke enters the detector, it disrupts this current because ions strike smoke particles and are neutralized. This drop in current triggers the alarm. The detector also has a reference chamber which is sealed but is ionized in the same way. Comparison of the ion currents in the two chambers allows compensation for changes due to air pressure, temperature, or the ageing of the source.\n\n Ionization-type smoke detectors are gaseous ionization detectors in widespread use. A small source of radioactive americium is placed so that it maintains a current between two plates that effectively form an ionisation chamber. If smoke gets between the plates where ionization is taking place, the ionized gas can be neutralized leading to a reduced current. The decrease in current triggers a fire alarm.\n\nQuestion: which type of fire detector uses the effect of smoke on a light source and photo-electric cell\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Romantic medicine is part of the broader movement known as Romanticism, most predominant in the period 1800–1840, and involved both the cultural (humanities) and natural sciences, not to mention efforts to better understand man within a spiritual context ('spiritual science'). Romanticism in medicine was an integral part of Romanticism in science.  The impetus for Romantic ideas in medicine came from \n\n the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of \"culture\" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.  Matthew Arnold contrasted \"culture\" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted \"culture\" with \"the state of nature\". According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between \"civilized\" and \"uncivilized.\" According to this way of thinking, \n\n The British Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century introduced new aesthetic ideas to literary studies, including the idea that the object of literature need not always be beautiful, noble, or perfect, but that literature itself could elevate a common subject to the level of the sublime. German Romanticism, which followed closely after the late development of German classicism, emphasized an aesthetic of fragmentation that can appear startlingly modern to the reader of English literature, and valued Witz – that is, \"wit\" or \"humor\" of a certain sort – more highly than the serious Anglophone Romanticism. The late nineteenth century brought renown to authors known more for their literary criticism than for their own literary work, such as Matthew Arnold.\n\n In Britain, the 19th century is dominated by the Victorian era, characterized by Romanticism, with Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Lord Byron or Samuel Taylor Coleridge and genres such as the gothic novel. Charles Dickens, perhaps the most famous novelist in the history of English literature, was active during this time and contributed to the novel's emergence as the leading literary genre of Victorian England. In Germany, the Sturm und Drang period of the late 18th century merges into a Classicist and Romantic period, epitomized by the long era of Goethe's activity, covering the first third of the century. The conservative Biedermeier style conflicts with the radical Vormärz in the turbulent period separating the end of the Napoleonic wars from the Revolutions of 1848. In Denmark, the early 19th century Golden Age produced prolific literary authors such as Søren Kierkegaard and Hans Christian Andersen. In the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by Realism and Naturalism. The late 19th century, known as the Belle Époque, with its Fin de siècle retrospectively appeared as a \"golden age\" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.\n\n Romanticism was a complex artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the eighteenth century in Western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature. Romanticism has been seen as \"the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages\", reaching beyond rational and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant. The name \"Romanticism\" itself was derived from the medieval genre chivalric romance. This movement contributed to the strong influence of such romances, disproportionate to their actual \n\nQuestion: when did the romanticism period start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These thefts were perpetrated by three of Jay's former adversaries, the Fiddler, the Shade, and the Thinker, who have joined forces.

In the show, Barry and Jay's situations are reversed: Jay (later revealed to be Hunter Zolomon) finds himself stranded on Earth 1, whereas in the comic, Barry arrives on Earth 2 (although he is able to leave at the end).\n\n \"Godspeed\" is the eighteenth episode of the fifth season of the American television series The Flash, based on the DC Comics character Barry Allen / Flash, a crime scene investigator who gains superhuman speed, which he uses to fight criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities. It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow. The episode was written by Judalina Neira and Kelly Wheeler, and is the directorial debut of Danielle Panabaker. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, and is joined by principal cast members Candice Patton, Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Hartley Sawyer, Danielle Nicolet, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L.

BD Wong voices the title character in a guest role. \"Godspeed\" originally aired on The CW on April 16, 2019, and was watched by a total of 1.31 million viewers.

The prize is a trip to see the first showing of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa in Britain for Clyde and his class. Luke does not tell Sarah Jane of the trip, since he was irritated that she criticized the untidiness of his room. While the class is at the International Gallery with its director, Mr Harding, the image of Mona Lisa comes to life, steps out of the painting and replaces herself with Mr Harding's assistant, Miss Trupp. She also is able to bring people and objects from other paintings to life and to transfer real people into paintings, which she does with the gallery staff and the police who responded to a call about the apparent theft.

While it first appears that the song will be a nostalgic look at the speaker's childhood, the song then goes on to describe the racial violence and economic depression that the speaker witnessed as an adolescent and a young adult. The song concludes with the speaker's reluctant proclamation that he plans to move his family out of the town, but not without first taking his own son on a drive and expressing the same community pride that was instilled in him by his father. Some of the song's images reference the recent history of Springsteen's hometown Freehold Borough, New Jersey, in particular the racial strife in 1960s New Jersey and economic tensions from the same times (such as the \"textile mill being closed\" was the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold).\n\n The song is a mid-tempo tune whose singer recalls being sent home one day from school for fighting when he was a child, and he tells his father what had happened, expecting punishment from his father. Instead his father tells him that fathers always love their children, and that such love is a \"love without end, Amen.\" In the second verse, the singer has now become a father, and he had no doubt that his son was \"just like (his) father's son\", and he passes his father's secret on to his son. In the third and final verse, the singer dreams that he has died and is standing outside the gates of Heaven. When he has doubts if he will enter or not due to bad choices he has made in his life, a Voice from the \"Other Side\" reiterates the words His Father once said to Him, illustrating the ultimate \"Love Without End\".\n\n In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical shtetl in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia, compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to \"scratch out a pleasant, simple tune\" without breaking their necks. In town, Tevye meets Perchik, a radical Marxist from Kiev, who admonishes those for talking but doing nothing about news of the tsar banishing Jews from their villages. Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for him tutoring his daughters. Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, a \n\n \"Tradition\" is the opening number for the 1964 Broadway musical Fiddler on the Roof. In the song, the main character, Tevye, explains the roles of each social class (fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters) in the village of Anatevka, and how the traditional roles of people like the matchmaker, the beggar, and the rabbi contribute to the village. The song also mentions the constable, the priest, and the other non-Jews with whom they rarely interact. Later in the song, an issue involving an argument between two men about selling the other person a horse and delivering a mule creates a ruckus in the village. Overall, the song sets up the major theme of the villagers trying to continue their traditions and keep their society running as the world around them changes.\n\n \"If I Were a Rich Man\" is a show tune from the 1964 musical Fiddler on the Roof. It was written by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock. The song is performed by Tevye, the main character in the musical, and reflects his dreams of glory. The title is inspired by a 1902 monologue by Sholem Aleichem in Yiddish, Ven ikh bin Rothschild (If I were a Rothschild), a reference to the wealth of the Rothschild family, although the content is quite different. The lyric is based in part on passages from Sholem Aleichem’s 1899 short story \"The Bubble Bursts.\" Both stories appeared in English in the 1949 collection of stories Tevye's Daughters.\n\nQuestion: who sings far from the home i love in fiddler on the roof\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The title is derived from the traditional British patriotic song \"Land of Hope and Glory\". The film was distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film tells the story of the Rowan family and their experiences of as seen through the eyes of the son, Billy (Sebastian Rice-Edwards). Hope and Glory was a critical and commercial success; it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. It also received 13 BAFTA Award nominations, winning for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Susan Wooldridge).\n\n as can be seen on YouTube and on 45 single record cover. A young woman is distraught that her fiancé chooses to enlist with Army recruiters passing through the town, causing her to implore him: \"Billy, don't be a hero, Don't be a fool with your lifeBilly, don't be a hero, Come back and make me your wifeAnd as he started to go, she said, 'Billy keep your head low'Billy, don't be a hero, Come back to me.\" The song goes on to describe how Billy is killed in action in a pitched battle after volunteering to ride out and seek reinforcements. In the end, the heartbroken woman throws away the official letter notifying her of Billy's \"heroic\" death.\n\n The song features in the 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. In the pilot episode of Friends, Ross says \"Do the words 'Billy, don’t be a hero' mean anything to you?”, meaning 'easier said than done'. The Doug Anthony Allstars performed a comedic cover of this song, featuring the altered line, \"Where did Billy's head go?\" in place of \"Billy, keep your head low.\" Dav Pilkey, creator of Captain Underpants, named the hero of The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby Billy solely to make possible a passing homage to \"Billy Don't Be a Hero.\"\n\n Paper Lace's version of \"Billy Don't Be a Hero\" reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 16 March 1974, and did likewise in Australia, where it spent eight weeks at the top spot. Thereafter, Bo Donaldson's and the Heywoods's version reached No. 1 in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 on 15 June 1974, and was dubbed into French for Canada. The US version sold over three and a half million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in June 1974. Donaldson and the Heywoods's version was a massive hit in Latin America and Japan as well, but it remained largely unknown elsewhere as of late July 2017. Billboard ranked it as the No. 21 song for 1974. Despite the song's popularity, it was poorly received, and it was voted No. 8 on Rolling Stone magazine's readers' poll of \"10 Worst Songs of the 1970s.\"\n\n \"Billy Don't Be a Hero\" is a 1974 pop song that was first a UK hit for Paper Lace and then, some months later, a US hit for Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods. The song was written and composed by two British songwriters, Mitch Murray and Peter Callander. Because the song was released in 1974, it was associated by some listeners with the Vietnam War, though the war to which it actually refers is never identified in the lyrics. It has been suggested that the drum pattern, references to a marching band leading soldiers in blue, and \"riding out\" (cavalry) refer to the American Civil War.

Mowgli returns the tusk to Hathi, offering him the hunter in exchange for ridding the jungle of Shere Khan. Mowgli meets with Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack, who refuse to go against jungle law to defeat Shere Khan.

A drunken Lockwood shoots at Shere Khan but wounds Mowgli instead. Before Lockwood can cause more harm, he is killed by Hathi. As the battle continues, Akela sacrifices himself to save Mowgli. With his dying breath, Akela names Mowgli as his successor. With Messua and the village watching, Mowgli returns to the jungle, and the mortally-wounded Shere Khan makes one last attempt to kill Mowgli. Mowgli protects himself, and then slays the tiger.

The British responded by closing Boston Harbor and enacting a series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded Massachusetts Bay Colony's privileges of self-government. The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts, and twelve of the thirteen colonies sent delegates in late 1774 to form a Continental Congress for the coordination of their resistance to Britain. Opponents of Britain were known as Patriots or Whigs, while colonists who retained their allegiance to the Crown were known as Loyalists or Tories. Open warfare erupted when British regulars sent \n\n The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation. Before the 1760s, Britain's American colonies had enjoyed a high level of autonomy in their internal affairs, which were locally governed by colonial legislatures.

The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the proposed new government. The new administration under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789. James Madison spearheaded Congressional amendments to the Constitution as assurances to those cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the inalienable rights that formed a foundation for the revolution. Rhode Island was the final state to ratify the Constitution in 1790, the first ten amendments were ratified in 1791 and became known as the United States Bill of Rights.\n\n A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the King of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England pioneered some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. The American Revolution led to the creation of a \n\n By the mid 19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia. The Australian Colonies Government Act 1850 was a landmark piece of legislation, granting representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state. In 1850 and elections for legislative councils were held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, limited self-government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. An innovative secret ballot was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, in which the government supplied voting paper containing the names of candidates and voters could select in private. This system was adopted around the world, becoming known as the \"Australian Ballot\". In the same year, all male British subjects ages 21 or over were granted the right to vote.\n\nQuestion: when did the tradition of self government began in america\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is a duet sung between Maria and Tony while they have a make-believe wedding. Larry Kert and Carol Lawrence introduced it in the 1957 Broadway production.\n\n in a theater lobby. In one scene, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II create a new song, \"There's Music in You\", then perform it for their friends, with Rodgers at the piano and Hammerstein singing the vocals. Mary Martin is later seen rehearsing the song for director Joshua Logan. The black-and-white film, which has a running time of 97 minutes, was directed by Tay Garnett, screenplay by Samson Raphaelson, based on a story Robert E. Sherwood, and photographed by James Wong Howe. Sequences were filmed in New York, with shots at the Martin Beck and old Empire theaters (the Empire was set to be demolished the year the film was released). Others as story characters include Gertrude Berg, as a landlady, Agnes Moorehead, Rosemary de Camp, Arthur Shields, and, in a fantasy sequence, Florence Bates, Madge Kennedy, Carl Benton Reid, Frank Ferguson, and Robert Bray.\n\n On the Town is a musical with music by Leonard Bernstein and book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, based on Jerome Robbins' idea for his 1944 ballet Fancy Free, which he had set to Bernstein's music. The musical introduced several popular and classic songs, among them \"New York, New York\", \"Lonely Town\", \"I Can Cook, Too\" (for which Bernstein also wrote the lyrics), and \"Some Other Time\". The story concerns three American sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City during World War II, 1944. Each of the three sailors meets and quickly connects with a woman. On the Town was first produced on Broadway in 1944 and was made into a film in 1949, although the film replaced all but four of the original Broadway numbers with Hollywood-written substitutes. The show has enjoyed several major revivals. The musical integrates dance into its storytelling: Robbins made several ballets and extended dance sequences for the show, including the \"Imaginary Coney Island\" ballet.\n\n In 1959 the British composer Peter Dickinson used part of the music in his Monologue for string orchestra, principally the melodic line under the lyric \"People will say we're in...\".\n\n Somewhere – The Songs of Sondheim and Bernstein is the third studio album by Australian singer Marina Prior featuring Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The album is a tribute to the work of Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein. In 1994, Prior starred as Maria in an Australian production of the musical West Side Story and won an Australian Variety Artists Mo Awards (MO) Award for 'Best Female Music Theatre Performer' for this role. The songs \"Tonight\" and \"One Hand, One Heart\" are duets with American actor Sean McDermott, who played Tony in the production of West Side Story. \"A Boy Like That\"/\"I Have a Love\" is a duet with Caroline O'Connor, who played Anita.\n\nQuestion: who wrote somewhere there 's a place for us\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It tells the story of B. R. Ambedkar, known mainly for his contributions in the emancipation of the downtrodden and oppressed classes in India and shaping the Constitution of India, as the chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constituent Assembly. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar won the National Film Awards for Best feature film in English, Best Actor (Mammootty) and Best Art Direction (Nitin Chandrakant Desai) in 1999. The film was screened retrospective on August 15, 2016 at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defence, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day.\n\n S. Anand is an Indian author, publisher and journalist. He, along with D. Ravikumar, founded the publishing house Navayana in 2003, which is \"India’s first and only publishing house to focus on the issue of caste from an anticaste perspective.\" Navayana won the British Council-London Book Fair International Young Publisher of the Year award in 2007. In Pali, the word \"navayana\" means \"new vehicle\". B. R. Ambedkar used the word in 1956 to describe the branch of Buddhism that wouldn't be mired in the Hinayana-Mahayana divide, but would help dalits gain equality in India. S. Anand is an Ambedkarite and a Buddhist. S. Anand co-authored, with Srividya Natarajan, and illustrators Durgabai Vyam and Suresh Vyam, the hugely popular graphic novel Bhimayana: Experiences of Untouchability on the life of B. R.

It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart.\n\nThe first feature we see in a person is probably their smile. So, we expect it to be presentable and pleasant. Any abnormality in teeth directly hampers the first look and diastema is one of the most common abnormalities seen in teeth. Diastema is usually a midline space between front two teeth, also seen in posterior teeth. In simple words, Diastema is the gap between teeth.\nIt has a wide range of causes from genetics to growth factors, habits and gum diseases. It is almost entirely treatable, with prognosis, depending upon patient compliance and proper maintenance therapy.\nAnterior spaces may interfere with smile, attractiveness and compromise facial esthetics. Diastema is among the most frequent reasons why patients seek orthodontic treatment.\nHence this article provides detailed information on the presentation of a diastema, causes, treatment, and prevention.\nDiastema is a prominent gap between two teeth. It is most commonly seen between central incisors (your front teeth) and sometimes between molars (posterior teeth).\nDiastema is common in milk teeth or primary dentition because of altering teeth and jaw sizes as we grow up. But it self-corrects by the time we reach adolescence (2).\nIf a diastema persists even after the complete set of permanent teeth have erupted and taken their rightful position in the jaws, then it is a problem.\nThe gap between teeth can be corrected with the orthodontic intervention which falls under the branch of corrective orthodontics.\nIt is a simple procedure and involves the use of brackets, stainless steel wires and elastics depending upon the extent of the diastema and overall condition of the jaws.\nLike most orthodontic therapy, diastema can be cured completely. The effectiveness of the treatment depends upon how early on the procedure has commenced and how well the post-therapeutic instructions are followed by the patient.\nGoing into the technicality and medical aspect of the word, there is a wide range of causes for the occurrence of a diastema or diastemata (plural).\nAnother primary cause is childhood oral habits like overuse of pacifiers for babies, nail-biting and even tongue thrusting. Children subconsciously keep repeating these habits.\nPeriodontally speaking, if there is an overgrowth in the surrounding tissue of the affected teeth, that is, the overgrowth of gums or attached gingiva, unwanted space is created between the teeth leading to diastema formation.\nDiastema is most commonly seen around frenum attachments. The frenum is an extension of our gum in between specific teeth like central incisors, anteriorly and the molars, posteriorly.\nIf there is an abnormal position of attachment of this frenum to the gingiva, that is, a very low attachment, it can lead to teeth drifting apart.\nGum diseases like Gingivitis and Periodontitis that is, inflammation of gums and surrounding tooth structure, respectively, can also lead to the gap between teeth or diastema.\nGingivitis is majorly caused by poor oral hygiene and detrimental habits like tobacco chewing. In some cases, it might be hormonal, like pregnancy gingivitis or even stress and age-related.\nThis majorly presents as swollen gums and bleeding gums. The swelling causes teeth to drift apart, which creates the gap between teeth.\nPeriodontitis, on the other hand, affects structures surrounding the teeth, majorly underlying bone structure. Because of compromised bone structure and periodontal ligaments, mobility appears in teeth, hence the drifting and diastema.\nDiastema makes a person visibly uncomfortable, so we all seek therapy for this ailment. The treatment is considerably simple, and once the underlying cause is terminated, relapse probabilities are reduced.\nSmall teeth and jaw can be treated with fixed orthodontic therapy over six months to a one-year period, depending upon the extent.\nThumb sucking is common in kids and it may cause diastema. It can be taken care of with the help of habit breaking appliances like thumb guards and tongue rollers.\nAlso, parents need to watch their kids on swallowing patterns since they can also cause diastema. Parents should enforce all necessary measures to stop these habits.\nGum inflammation can cause diastema. But regular cleaning sessions can reduce the gum inflammation over time. In cases of high frenal attachments, frenectomy can be done.\nThis is a simple procedure that relieves the pressure on the teeth and drifting stops. In all of the cases mentioned above, after treating the underlying causes, fixed orthodontic therapy should be done followed by retention appliances.\nSome diastema is definitely preventable. This includes helping your children break a habit, like a thumb sucking or tongue thrusting as soon as you notice them doing it.\nLearning proper swallowing reflexes can train the child get over infantile pattern of swallowing, and practicing good oral hygiene can reduce the gingival and periodontal cause of diastema.\nVisit your dentist twice a year for regular cleanings and dental examinations. Brush and floss regularly to avoid a wide array of dental problems.\nSo, if you have a void in your dental arch, then visit your dentist as soon as possible. Diastema is a stubborn and sometimes unavoidable ailment.\nIf you want to maintain a good esthetics, then the gap between teeth shouldn’t be ignored as our jaws expand over time. Over the period, the size of the diastema might enlarge and cause functional problems.\n\nGaps between teeth can be caused by various factors. One common cause is size mismatch, where the size of the teeth is smaller compared to the size of the jaw bone. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. Another possible cause is an oversized labial frenum, which is the tissue that runs from the upper lip to the gums. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap.\n\nHabits like thumb sucking and tongue thrust can also cause gaps between teeth. Thumb sucking can shift the front teeth forward, while tongue thrust is a swallowing reflex disorder where the tongue pushes against the upper front teeth instead of the roof of the mouth. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time.\n\nFurthermore, gum disease and tooth loss can contribute to the formation of gaps. Gum disease can result in the loss of jaw bone volume, making the teeth loose. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth.\n\nTo address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps. Dental crowns may also be used in some cases.\n\nIt's important to consult with a dentist to determine which treatment option is most suitable for your specific situation.\n\nGaps can occur between any teeth, but for those with large gaps between the front facing teeth, dental gaps can be a source of self-consciousness. Cosmetic dentistry treatments can address dental flaws and close gaps between the teeth, creating beautiful, flawless smiles. To find out which treatment for gapped teeth is right for you, schedule a consultation with Harrisburg, PA dentists Warren Silvers III or Daniel Laux.\nWhat Causes Gaps between Teeth?\nSize mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth.\nOversized labial frenum: An oversized labial frenum may cause a diastema between the two upper front teeth. The labial frenum is the tissue that runs from the upper lip to the gums, and normally stops just above the two front teeth. In some cases, the labial frenum extends down and between the two front teeth, creating a gap.\nThumb sucking: Thumb sucking can cause gaps to form between the teeth as this habit can force the front teeth to shift forward.\nTongue thrust: Tongue thrust, a swallowing reflex disorder, can lead to gaps forming between the teeth. With tongue thrust, the tongue pushes against the upper front teeth rather than the roof of the mouth. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time.\nGum disease and tooth loss: Gum disease can lead to loss of jaw bone volume, causing the teeth to become loose. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth.\nPorcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments.\nDental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps.\nDental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth.\nInvisalign®: Orthodontic treatment with Invisalign® uses a series of clear trays to gradually adjust the alignment of the teeth and close gaps in the process.\nTraditional Orthodontics: Traditional orthodontics is highly effective at closing gaps between teeth. With traditional orthodontics, a wire and bracket system is bonded to the teeth and gradually tightened to change the position of the teeth, resulting in beautifully aligned teeth.\nFrenectomy: An oversized labial frenum may be reduced through minor surgery called a frenectomy. Gaps may close on their own in younger children who've undergone a frenectomy. Older children and adults will generally require additional treatment, like braces, to close gaps after a frenectomy.\nMissing Tooth Replacement: Gaps causes by missing teeth can be corrected with treatments for replacing missing teeth, like dental implants or dental bridges.\nTongue Thrust Treatment: Patients with tongue thrust should speak to their dentist about ways to retrain their swallowing reflex.\nFor more information about treatment for gapped teeth, or to find out which treatments are right for you, we welcome you to schedule a consultation with Dr. Silvers or Dr. Laux.\n\n A diastema (plural diastemata, from greek διάστημα, space) is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As of 2013, there are only two other freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere which exceed 500 m in height; the Willis Tower in Chicago, which stands at 527 m when measured to its pinnacle; and the topped-out One World Trade Center in New York City, which has a pinnacle height of 541.33 m, or approximately 12 m shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence), the height of One World Trade Center is unlikely to be increased. The proposed Chicago Spire was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its construction was halted early due to financial difficulties amid the Great Recession, and was eventually cancelled in 2010.\n\n The CN Tower is Canada's National Tower, and it is one of the attractions that is open 364 days a year. It is visited by approximately 2 million people every year. In 1995, the CN Tower was classified as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers, and for more than 30 years it was the world's tallest free-standing structure. The CN Tower consists of many inner attractions like the Glass Floor, SkyPod, 360 restaurant and EdgeWalk. EdgeWalk is a full circle hands-free walk on a 5 feet wide ledge encircling the top of the Tower, which is 1,168 feet aboveground. It has also been mentioned in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest external walk on a building. Also, the CN Tower provides various services for individuals with disabilities and special needs.\n\n When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at 447 m, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at 346 m, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at 342 m. One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes. The tower would garner world wide media attention when stuntman Dar Robinson jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980. The first was for a scene from the movie Highpoint, in which Robinson received $250,000 ($ in dollars) for the stunt. The second was for a personal documentary. Both stunts used a wire decelerator attached to his back. On June 26, 1986, the ten-year anniversary of the tower's opening, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin, in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day. Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground.\n\n The CN Tower (Tour CN) is a 553.3 m concrete communications and observation tower located in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976. Its name \"CN\" originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years until 2007 when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is now the ninth tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers. It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually.\n\n Carnegie Hall Tower is a skyscraper at 152 West 57th Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. Completed in 1990 and designed by César Pelli, the building measures 757 ft tall with 60 stories. Due to the presence of Carnegie Hall and the Russian Tea Room on adjacent sites, the tower is only 50 ft wide on 57th Street, making it among the world's most slender skyscrapers at its completion. Carnegie Hall Tower is designed with a red-and-orange brick facade and cast-concrete decorations, both inspired by the older structure. The tower rises above a six-story base, which contains a setback from 57th Street. The structure has an \"L\"-shaped plan through the 42nd floor and a rectangular plan above that story. The superstructure is made of concrete, with a core made of two connected concrete tubes. The building was designed with 485000 ft2 \n\nQuestion: how many steps does the cn tower have\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled to 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states. A final agreement was reached in early September.

The EAC's founding treaty of 1967 makes provision for co-operation among member states to develop science, technology and innovation. On 1 July 2010, the five EAC members formed a common market; the agreement provides for the free movement of goods, labour, services and capital. \n\n The Treaty for the Establishment of the current East African Community (The Treaty) was signed on 30 November 1999 and entered into force on 7 July 2000 following its ratification by the original three Partner States, namely Republic of Kenya, Republic of Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. The Republic of Burundi and the Republic of Rwanda acceded to the EAC Treaty on 18 June 2007 and became full Members of the Community with effect from 1 July 2007. Upon its re-establishment, EAC recognized IUCEA as one of the surviving institutions of the former Community. Therefore, it was agreed to establish IUCEA as an institution of the new EAC. In that process in 2000 IUCEA underwent revitalization following the recommendations of the CHEMS study and in 2002 the Ministers responsible for Higher Education of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda signed the IUCEA Protocol as an instrument that made IUCEA a legal body corporate of EAC.\n\n The 18th EAC Ordinary summit was held on 20 May 2017 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907, the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Oval, thereby, became the second ground to stage a Test, after Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In 1882, Australia won the Test by seven runs within two days. The Sporting Times printed a mocking obituary notice for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia. The first Test double century was scored at The Oval in 1884 by Australia's Billy Murdoch. \n\n umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches. The first written \"Laws of Cricket\" were drawn up in 1744. They stated, \"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must be 22 inches high and the bail across them six inches. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart\". There were no limits on the shape or size of the bat. It appears that 40 \n\n which parishioners knelt in church). There is also a reference to 'criquet' in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages. In 1706 William Goldwyn published the first description of the game. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a \"milk-white\" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called \"play\" and the \"leathern orb\" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, \n\n Ridge\" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series with Richie Benaud taking 6-70 during the English runchase. The tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962–63, 1964, 1965–66 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face \n\n a third stump became commonplace. By 1780, the duration of a first-class cricket match was generally three days, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time. Between 1750 and 1760, this figure rose to 230, \n\nQuestion: when did cricket go to 6 ball overs\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Representatives that choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominated candidate usually vote for someone else in their party or vote \"present\". Moreover, as the Constitution does not explicitly state that the speaker must be an incumbent member of the House, it is permissible for representatives to vote for someone who is not a member of the House at the time, and non-members have received a few votes in various speaker elections over the past several years. Nevertheless, every person elected speaker has been a member. Representatives that choose to vote for someone other than their \n\n less than five per cent of the votes cast. The House continued to vote until one member received the requisite majority under a voting system known as the exhaustive ballot. Then, the House voted on a formal motion to appoint the member in question to the Speakership. The Father of the House, Alan Williams, was the presiding officer of the Commons during the election process. The final stage of appointment of a new Speaker is a formality but has constitutional significance. The Queen must signify her approval of the new Speaker, which is done by the appointment of a Royal Commission.\n\n The speaker is chosen by a majority vote of the Assembly members at the start of each session or whenever a vacancy occurs in the role during a session, as such, the speaker is almost always the de facto leader of the Assembly's majority party. A speaker pro tempore is elected concurrent with the election of the speaker, to carry out the speaker's duties in his or her absence. Unlike the United States House of Representatives, the rules of the Assembly require that the speaker and speaker pro tempore be elected from among the members of the Assembly.\n\n The speaker is always a member of Parliament, and is elected to the position by other members of Parliament at the beginning of a parliamentary term. If the office becomes vacant during a parliamentary term then the House must elect a new speaker when it next sits. The election of a speaker is presided over by the clerk of the House. It is not unusual for an election to be contested. If there are two candidates, members vote in the lobbies for their preferred candidate. In the case of three or more candidates, a roll-call vote is conducted and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated, with the process continuing (or reverting \n\nQuestion: who votes in the speaker of the house\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They suggested that some of the worst floods were believed to have been the result of a mortal upsetting a dragon. Many pictures of Chinese dragons show a flaming pearl under their chin or in their claws. The pearl is associated with spiritual energy, wisdom, prosperity, power, immortality, thunder, or the moon. Chinese art often depicts a pair of dragons chasing or fighting over the flaming pearl. Chinese dragons are occasionally depicted with bat-like wings growing out of the front limbs, but most do not have wings, as their ability to fly (and control rain/water, etc.) is \n\n typically considered to be evil and demonic, Asian dragons are regarded as wholesome and benevolent, and thus worthy of veneration, not slaying. If rainfall is insufficient, however, drought and famine can result. Veneration of dragons in China seems to be associated with annually ensuring life-giving water and bountiful rice harvests in south-central China. Another ritual called Awakening of the Dragon involves a Taoist priest dotting the bulging eyes of the carved dragon head attached to the boat. Doing so symbolizes the dragon ending its slumber and reenergizing its spirit, or ch'i. In modern dragon boat festivals, a representative can be invited to step forward to dot \n\n The Chinese dragon, also known as loong, long or lung, is a legendary creature in Chinese mythology, Chinese folklore, and Chinese culture at large. Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. Academicians have identified four reliable theories on the origin of the Chinese dragon: snakes, Chinese alligators, thunder and nature worship. They traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture. During the days of Imperial China, the Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial strength and power. In Chinese culture, excellent and outstanding people are compared to a dragon, while \n\n to be the rulers of water on earth: rivers, lakes, and seas; they were also thought to dominate the waters of the heavens: clouds, mists, and rains. There are earth dragons, mountain dragons, and sky or celestial dragons (Tian Long) in Chinese tradition. Mythical dragons and serpents are also found widely in many cultures around the world.  Traditional dragon boat racing, in China, coincides with the 5th day of the 5th Chinese lunar month (varying from late May to June on the modern Gregorian Calendar). The summer solstice occurs around 21 June and is the reason why Chinese refer to their festival as \"Duan Wu\" or \"Duen \n\n  The Chinese dragon is one of the most important mythical creatures in Chinese mythology, considered to be the most powerful and divine creature and the controller of all waters who could create clouds with their breath. The dragon symbolized great power and was very supportive of heroes and gods. The conventional dragon has a certain description, however there are other dragons or dragon-like beings that vary from this description. For example, the Chi of mythology lacks horns. Dragons often chase or play with a mystical or flaming pearl. A dragon-fenghuang pairing is a common motif in art, the fenghuang often being called a \"phoenix\". One of the most famous dragons in Chinese mythology is Yinglong, the god of rain. Many people in different places pray to Yinglong to receive rain.

And typically there is no rationing. Dal Batti - Churma is the most popular delicacy, usually served with baatis and dal. It is coarsely ground wheat crushed and cooked with ghee and sugar. Traditionally it is made by mashing up wheat flour baatis or leftover rotis in ghee and jaggery.

A distinctive characteristic of Uttarakhand cuisine is the sparing use of tomatoes, milk, and milk-based products. Coarse grain with high fibre content is very common in Uttarakhand due to the harsh terrain. Crops most commonly associated with Uttarakhand are Buckwheat (locally called Kotu or Kuttu) and the regional crops, Maduwa and Jhangora, particularly in the interior regions of Kumaon and Garhwal. Generally, either Desi Ghee or Mustard oil is used for the purpose of cooking food. Simple recipes are made interesting with the use of hash seeds Jakhya as spice, chutney made of Bhang is also a regional cuisine. Bal Mithai is a popular fudge-like sweet. Other popular dishes include Dubuk, Chains, Kap, Bhatiya, Jaula, Phana, Paliyo, Chutkani and Sei. In sweets; Swal, Ghughut/Khajur, Arsa, Mishri, Gatta and Gulgulas are popular.

It is made by boiling a mixture of water, sugar, milk, and cornflour until it becomes solid. Saffron is used for flavoring. Ghee is used to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Almonds, pistachios, and cardamom seeds are added.

While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their Mickey Mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products, as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some pejorative use of Mickey's name, but licensed Disney products sell well, and the so-called Disneyana has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984). Disneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. Disney's earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n  The original concept for Holidayland was that of a turn-of-the-century town park, with picnic areas, horseshoe pits, a baseball diamond, and perhaps an open field where a circus could come to perform. This original version would be located where the Matterhorn sits today. As Disneyland came together in 1954, it became apparent that there wasn't enough space within the park for Holidayland to become a reality, and the land (now sometimes called \"Recreationland\") became a picnic and recreation area, with minor seasonal holiday decorations. In November 1955, the Mickey Mouse Club Circus came to Disneyland, in the Fantasyland section of the park. This event only lasted until January 1956, and was themed to the celebration of Christmas, with promotional material referring to the circus as \"Holidayland,\" including a November 25, 1955 Los Angeles Times article declaring \"Holidayland was a roaring success. The kids consumed great amounts of popcorn, and [Walt] Disney enjoyed himself as much as anybody.\n\n The Tokyo Disney Resort (東京ディズニーリゾート) (local nickname TDR ) is a theme park and vacation resort located in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan, just east of Tokyo. The resort is fully owned and operated by The Oriental Land Company under a license from The Walt Disney Company, who constructed and designed the resort and its various attractions. The resort opened on April 15, 1983, as a single theme park (Tokyo Disneyland), but later developed into a resort with a second theme park (Tokyo DisneySea), four Disney hotels, six non-Disney hotels and a shopping complex (Ikspiari). Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park to open outside the United States and the resort is the only Disney Parks resort in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.\n\n Plans for a second Disney park in Tokyo were first conceived in 1987. Initially, these plans included a park similar to Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios), to be called Disney Hollywood Studio Theme Park at Tokyo Disneyland. This idea was later scrapped in 1992. During the creation of the park, the United States and Japan had to compromise on certain design elements of the park due to cultural differences, such as the park's entrance focal point. Ground was broken on October 22, 1998 and the park opened on September 4, 2001. Upon opening, Tokyo DisneySea became the ninth park of the twelve worldwide Disney theme parks to \n\n Disneyland Park, originally Euro Disneyland Park, is a theme park found at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France.

Spanning 56.656 ha—the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland Park—it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. In 2016, the park hosted approximately 8.4 million visitors, making it the most-visited theme park in Europe and the 13th-most visited theme park in the world. The park is represented by Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle), a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty.\n\nQuestion: who was the first to say i 'm going to disney world\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1777, all members of Congress and Washington's Continental Army were required to take the oath of allegiance to the United States. Richard Stockton as a prisoner of war, and taken behind enemy lines was also required to take the oath. He was called before the Board, took the oath and was dismissed. Stockton did not turn in any protection papers as was required if one signed Howe's Proclamation and were given a pardon.\n\n Gwinnett's autograph is highly sought by collectors as a result of a combination of the desire by many top collectors to acquire a complete set of autographs by all 56 signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and the extreme rarity of the Gwinnett signature; there are 51 known examples, since Gwinnett was fairly obscure prior to signing the Declaration and died shortly afterward.

The statement, however was not followed through, despite negotiations and reassurances made by Marcos again in 1984 with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Following the overthrow of Marcos, President Corazon Aquino sought to officially drop the claim before the 1987 ASEAN Summit. A bill to repeal Republic Act 5446 was filed by Leticia Ramos Shahani in the Philippine Senate in 1987. The bill was widely criticised for effectively dropping \n\n and the EU, respectively, taking them out of any discussion between ASEAN and the EU. With East Timor’s independence it ceased to be a burden in ASEAN-EU relations. The EU-ASEAN dialogue was reinvigorated in 1994.

On 4 June 2015, Barcelona's official website announced that Pedro had renewed his contract until 30 June 2019. His buyout clause would remain at €150 million. On 6 June 2015, Pedro appeared as an added-time substitute for Barça in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, as the club won its fifth European Cup/Champions League title by beating Juventus 3–1 at Berlin's Olympiastadion. This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice. Pedro, Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, Gerard Piqué, Sergio Busquets and Dani Alves are the only players to have been a part of both treble-winning teams. As an extra-time substitute, Pedro scored the winning goal as Barcelona won the 2015 UEFA Super Cup 5–4 against Sevilla in Tbilisi; it was his second winner in a Super Cup, and came in the 115th minute like its predecessor.\n\n  Hugo Sánchez widely regarded as the greatest Mexican footballer of all time, was named best CONCACAF player of the 20th century by IFFHS. No other Mexican footballer has scored as many goals in Europe as Hugo Sánchez.

Rafael Márquez the first Mexican to win the UEFA Champions League is considered by many the best defender in the country's football history. Márquez is Mexico's record World Cup player and one of only three players with appearances in five tournaments. Cuauhtémoc Blanco is the only Mexican football player to be presented with an award (The Silver Ball and Silver Shoe) in a major international FIFA competition (1999 FIFA Confederations Cup). He shares the record as the highest scorer of the tournament with Ronaldinho \n\n The 2014–15 season was Futbol Club Barcelona's 115th in existence and the club's 84th consecutive season in the top flight of Spanish football. It was one of the most successful seasons in the club's history as they clinched the Treble by winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. By doing so, the Catalans became the first European team to twice win the domestic double as well as the highest continental tournament, after winning their first treble in the 2008–09 season. Barcelona's success was due to a large extent to their formidable forward trio composed of Lionel Messi, Neymar and summer signing Luis Suárez, who scored an unprecedented total of 122 goals in all competitions to become the trio with most goals in Spanish football history. This was also the first season under head coach Luis Enrique. The season was the first since 1998–99 without former captain Carles Puyol, who retired after the 2013–14 season.\n\n Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma (born 28 July 1987), known as Pedro, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a forward or winger for Serie A club Lazio.

Legislation was introduced to make it the national insect of the United States, but this failed in 1989 and again in 1991. Homeowners are increasingly establishing butterfly gardens; monarchs can be attracted by cultivating a butterfly garden with specific milkweed species and nectar plants. Efforts are underway to establish these monarch waystations. An IMAX film, Flight of the Butterflies, describes the story of the Urquharts, Brugger, and Trail to document the then-unknown monarch migration to Mexican overwintering areas. Sanctuaries and reserves have been created at overwintering locations in Mexico and California to limit habitat destruction. These sites can generate significant tourism revenue. However, with less tourism, monarch butterflies will have a higher survival rate because they show more protein content and a higher value of immune response and oxidative defense. Organizations and individuals participate in tagging programs. Tagging information is used to study migration patterns. The 2012 novel by Barbara Kingsolver, Flight Behavior, deals with the appearance of a large population in the Appalachians.\n\nSteven M. Reppert (born September 4, 1946) is an American neuroscientist known for his contributions to the fields of chronobiology and neuroethology. His research has focused primarily on the physiological, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythms in mammals and more recently on the navigational mechanisms of migratory monarch butterflies. He was the Higgins Family Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts Medical School from 2001 to 2017, and from 2001 to 2013 was the founding chair of the Department of Neurobiology. Reppert stepped down as chair in 2014. He is currently distinguished professor emeritus of neurobiology.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nSteven Reppert grew up in the village of Pender, Nebraska, and graduated from Pender Public High School in 1964. His interest in science began in childhood with the cecropia moth—an insect made famous by Harvard biologist Carroll M. Williams, who used the moth in his pioneering work on the role of juvenile hormone in molting and metamorphosis. Reppert continues to rear cecropia from egg to adult each summer.\n\nEducation and career\nReppert received his BS and MD in 1973 (with distinction) from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine and was elected as a medical student to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.  From 1973 to 1976 he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1976 to 1979 Reppert was a postdoctoral fellow in neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, in David C. Klein's laboratory, which focuses on the pineal gland and circadian biology. Reppert was on the faculty at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School beginning in 1979 and was promoted to professor in 1993; he directed the Laboratory of Developmental Chronobiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1983 to 2001, when he moved to the University of Massachusetts Medical School.\n\nResearch\nReppert has published more than 180 papers. He is the principal inventor on seven patents derived from his research.\n\nFetal circadian clocks\nRodent studies have shown that the master brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is functional in the fetus before the fetal brain is capable of registering the presence of light. Reppert and colleagues reported that the fetal SCN is entrained to the light-dark cycle before the retinohypothalamic pathway innervates the SCN from the eye.  This finding indicates that the mother, and her entrainment to ambient light-dark cycles, provides the necessary information to the fetus for synchronization. As Reppert states, “Mom is functioning as the transducer for the fetal circadian system. She takes in light information to her circadian system, and then that is communicated to the fetal circadian system.” This fetal entrainment persists into the postnatal period and ensures that neonatal behavioral patterns are properly tuned with the environment. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals.\n\nMammalian circadian clocks\nSteven Reppert and colleagues have made seminal contributions that provide insight into the mammalian circadian clock mechanism.\n\nCell autonomy in the SCN\nReppert and colleagues discovered that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators. They cultured cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode array that allowed them to monitor individual SCN neuron activity in culture. Circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture were not synchronized, indicating that they functioned independently of one another.\n\nFunctions of mouse clock genes: PERIOD2 and PERIOD3\nReppert and coworkers also discovered the mouse clock genes mPer2 and mPer3 and defined their functions. They found that the mPER2 and mPER3 proteins, as well as the previously discovered mPER1, share several regions of homology with one another and with Drosophila PER.  Reppert and coworkers found different light responses among the three Per genes.  Unlike mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA levels, mPer3 mRNA levels are not acutely altered by light exposure during the subjective night.  They also found that mPer1–3 are widely expressed in tissues outside the brain, including the liver, skeletal muscles, and testis.  To determine the function of mPER1–3, Reppert and colleagues disrupted the three genes encoding them. Using double-mutant mice, they showed that mPER3 functions outside the core circadian clockwork, whereas both mPER1 and mPER2 are necessary for rhythmicity.\n\nNegative transcriptional feedback loop\nReppert and colleagues discovered that the two mouse cryptochromes, mCRY1 and mCRY2, function as the primary transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression, and the mPER proteins are necessary for CRY nuclear translocation. This work provided the first portrayal of a negative transcriptional feedback loop as the major gear driving the mouse molecular clock.\n\nInterlocking transcriptional feedback loops\nReppert and colleagues found that the core mechanisms for the SCN in mammals consist of interacting positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops. The first loop is an autoregulatory negative transcriptional feedback loop in which the mCRY proteins negatively regulate mCry and mPer gene transcription. The second interlocking feedback loop involves the rhythmic regulation of Bmal1. Rhythmicity of Bmal1 is not necessary for clockwork function, but it helps modulate the robustness of rhythmicity.\n\nCLOCK and NPAS2\nReppert and colleagues discovered that the transcription factors CLOCK and NPAS2 have overlapping roles in the SCN, revealing a new and unexpected role for NPAS2. His lab observed that CLOCK-deficient mice continue to have behavioral and molecular rhythms, which showed that CLOCK is not essential for circadian rhythm in locomotor activity in mice.  They then determined, by investigating CLOCK-deficient mice, that NPAS2 is a paralog of CLOCK and can functionally substitute CLOCK by dimerizing with BMAL1.  Finally, they found—by investigating CLOCK-deficient, NPAS2-deficient, and double-mutant mice—that circadian rhythms in peripheral oscillators require CLOCK.  Thus, there is a fundamental difference between CLOCK and NPAS2 that is tissue dependent.\n\nMammalian melatonin receptors\nIn 1994, Reppert cloned human and sheep Mel1a melatonin receptor, the first in a family of GPCRs that bind the pineal hormone melatonin, and localized its expression in the mammalian brain to the SCN and the hypophyseal pars tuberalis. Mel1a is believed to be responsible for the circadian effects of melatonin and the reproductive actions in seasonal breeding mammals.\n\nIn 1995, Reppert cloned and characterized the Mel1b melatonin receptor. He and colleagues found that the receptor was predominantly expressed in the retina, where it is believed to modify light-dependent retinal functions. They identified outbred populations of Siberian hamsters that lacked functional Mel1b but maintained circadian and reproductive responses to melatonin; these data indicate that Mel1b is not necessary for the circadian and reproductive actions of melatonin, which instead depend on Mel1a.\n\nElucidation of the molecular nature of the melatonin receptors has facilitated definition of their ligand-binding characteristics and aided the development of melatonin analogs that are now used to treat sleep disorders and depression.\n\nInsect cryptochromes\nIn 2003, Reppert began investigating the functional and evolutionary properties of the CRY protein in the monarch butterfly. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2.\nHis work demonstrated that the monarch CRY1 protein is functionally analogous to Drosophila CRY, the blue-light photoreceptor necessary for photoentrainment in the fly. He also demonstrated that monarch CRY2 is functionally analogous to vertebrate CRYs and that monarch CRY2 acts as a potent transcriptional repressor in the circadian clock transcriptional translation feedback loop of the butterfly, as his group previously showed for the two mouse CRYs. These data propose the existence of a novel circadian clock unique to some non-drosophilid insects that possesses mechanisms characteristic of both the Drosophila and the mammalian clocks. Other insects, such as bees and ants, possess only a vertebrate-like CRY, and their circadian clocks are even more vertebrate like. Drosophila is the only known insect that does not possess a vertebrate-like CRY.\n\nIn 2008, Reppert discovered the necessity of Cry for light-dependent magnetoreception responses in Drosophila. He also showed that magnetoreception requires UVA/blue light, the spectrum corresponding with the action spectrum of Drosophila CRY.\nThese data were the first to genetically implicate CRY as a component of the input pathway or the chemical-based pathway of magnetoreception. Applying these findings to his work with the monarch, Reppert has shown that both monarch CRY1 and CRY2 proteins, when transgenically expressed in CRY-deficient flies, successfully restore magnetoreception function. These results propose the presence of a CRY-mediated magnetosensitivity system in monarchs that may act in concordance with the sun compass to aid navigation. In 2011, Reppert also discovered that human CRY2 can substitute as a functional magnetoreceptor in CRY-deficient flies, a discovery that warrants additional research into magnetosensitivity in humans.\n\nMonarch butterfly migration\n\nSince 2002, Reppert and coworkers have pioneered the study of the biological basis of monarch butterfly migration. Each fall, millions of monarchs from the eastern United States and southeastern Canada migrate as much as 4,000 km to overwinter in roosts in Central Mexico.   Monarch migration is not a learned activity, given that migrants flying south are at least two generations removed from the previous year's migrants. Thus, migrating monarchs must have some genetically based navigational mechanism.\n\nReppert and colleagues have focused on a novel circadian clock mechanism and its role in time-compensated sun compass orientation, a major navigational strategy that butterflies use during their fall migration. Using clock-shift experiments, they showed that the circadian clock must interact with the sun compass to enable migrants to maintain a southerly flight direction as the sun moves daily across the sky. Reppert collaborated with Eli Shlizerman at the University of Washington and Daniel Forger at the University of Michigan to propose a working mathematical model of the time-compensated sun compass.\n\nClockwork mechanism\nThe monarch clockwork model, which has both Drosophila-like and mammal-like aspects, is unique because it employs two distinct CRY proteins. As presented in a 2010 review paper, the clock mechanism, on a gene/protein level, operates as follows:\n In an autoregulatory transcriptional feedback loop, heterodimers of CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) form and drive the transcription of the Per, Tim, and Cry2 genes.\n TIM, PER, and CRY2 proteins are translated and form complexes in the cytoplasm.\n 24 hours later, CRY2 returns to the nucleus and inhibits CLK:CYC transcription.\n Meanwhile, PER is progressively phosphorylated, which may aid CRY2 translocation into the nucleus.\n CRY1 protein is a circadian photoreceptor that, when exposed to light, causes TIM degradation, allowing light to gain access to the central clock mechanism for photic entrainment.\n\nAntennal clocks\nReppert’s lab expanded upon Fred Urquhart's postulation that antennae play a role in monarch migration. In 2009 Reppert’s lab reported that, despite previous assumptions that the time-compensation clocks are located exclusively in the brain, there are also clocks located in the antennae, which \"are necessary for proper time-compensated sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.”  They concluded this by comparing the sun compass orientation of monarch migrants with intact antennae and those whose antennae had been removed. Reppert's lab also studied antennae in vitro and found that antennal clocks can be directly entrained by light and can function independently from the brain. Further research is needed, however, on the interaction between the circadian clocks in monarch butterfly's antennae and the sun compass in the brain.\n\nIn 2012, Reppert and colleagues determined that only a single antenna is sufficient for sun compass orientation. They did so by painting one antenna black to cause discordant light exposure between the two antennae; the single not-painted antenna was sufficient for orientation. All four clock genes (per, tim, cry1, and cry2) were expressed in the various studied areas of the antenna, suggesting that \"light entrained circadian clocks are distributed throughout the length of the monarch butterfly antenna.\"\n\nIn 2013, Reppert and colleagues showed that spring remigrants also use an antenna-dependent time-compensated sun compass to direct their northward flight from Mexico to the southern United States.\n\nSun compass\nUsing anatomical and electrophysiological studies of the monarch butterfly brain, Reppert and colleagues have indicated that the central complex, a midline structure in the central brain, is likely the site of the sun compass.\n\nMagnetic compass\nReppert and colleagues showed that migratory monarchs can use a light-dependent, inclination-based, magnetic compass for navigation on overcast days.\n\nTemperature\nReppert and coworkers showed that fall migrants prematurely exposed to overwintering-like coldness reverse their flight orientation to the north. The temperature microenvironment at the overwintering site is essential for successful completion of the migration cycle: without cold exposure, aged migrants continue to orient to the south. The discovery that coldness triggers the northward flight direction in spring remigrants underscores how vulnerable the migration may be to climate change.\n\nMonarch butterfly genome\nIn 2011, Reppert and colleagues presented the draft sequence of the monarch butterfly genome and a set 16,866 protein-coding genes. This is the first characterized genome of a butterfly and of a long-distance migratory species.\n\nIn 2012, Reppert and colleagues established MonarchBase, an integrated database for the genome of Danaus plexippus. The goal of the project was to make genomic and proteomic information about monarch butterflies accessible to biological and lepidopteran communities.\n\nIn 2013, Reppert and coworkers developed a novel gene-targeting approach in monarchs that uses a zinc finger nuclease strategy to define the essential nature of CRY2 for clockwork function in lepidopterans. Targeted mutagenesis of Cry2 indeed resulted in the in vivo disruption of circadian behavior and the molecular clock mechanism. Nuclease strategies are powerful tools for targeting additional clock genes in monarchs and altering gene function.\n\nIn 2016, Reppert collaborated with Marcus Kronforst at the University of Chicago and others to use population genetic studies to define the evolutionary history of the monarch migration.\n\nAwards and honors\n Charles King Trust Research Fellowship, 1981–1984\n Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award, March of Dimes Fund, 1981–1983\n Established Investigator Award of the American Heart Association, 1985–1990\n Fellow, American Society for Clinical Investigation, elected 1987\n E.

Ever since Agnes got The Saints' Way (The Saints' Way is a book that everyone in Mount Blessing gets when they turn twelve; it is given by the leader Emmanuel), she has changed. Agnes now abides by all the rules in Mount Blessing, and she goes by whatever Emmanuel says. Honey on the other hand, never listens to Emmanuel or Veronica, never follows the rules and hates living at Mount Blessing. Whenever they, or anyone, do something wrong they are sent to the \"regulation room\". There they get whipped by Emmanuel and Veronica. Everything stays this way until Nana Pete, Agnes' grandmother, shows up unexpectedly and finds out the truth behind Mount Blessing.\n\n War I breaking out, lives on past 1916 - tries to hold together the remnants of the British Empire and re-settle Britain, though the refounded London is little more than \"a raw frontier town\". Against this background, the book describes the life and the adventures of Guilford Law, a young American photographer. As a 14-year-old boy, Guilford Law witnessed the \"Miracle\" as shimmering lights moving eerily across the ocean sky. As a grown man, he is determined to travel to the strange continent of Darwinia and explore its mysteries.

On January 9, 1983, the Vikings defeated the Atlanta Falcons, 30–24, in a 1st-round game that was the first playoff game at the Metrodome. On January 17, 1999, the Falcons defeated the Vikings in the first NFC championship game played at the Metrodome. On December 29, 2013, the Vikings played their final game at the Metrodome, a 14–13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The team's record at the dome was 162–88 in the regular season and 6–4 in playoff games. They finished with a perfect record at the dome against the Arizona Cardinals (8–0), Baltimore Ravens (1–0), Cincinnati Bengals (4–0), and Houston Texans (1–0), but with a winless record there against the New York Jets (0–3).\n\n league history, the third highest ranking for a team that didn't win a championship and the highest for a team that failed to play in either the Super Bowl or the NFL Championship Game. In a 2018 retrospective, Sports Illustrated called the 1998 Vikings \"The Greatest Team Never to Make It.\" The loss had a dramatic effect on Minnesota sports culture, as the 1998 Vikings were considered the team most likely to deliver a Super Bowl championship to a franchise that had already suffered multiple heartbreaking defeats. Numerous publications have noted the influence that the loss had on the Vikings fan base; \n\n The 2009 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 49th in the National Football League and their fourth under head coach Brad Childress. The Vikings improved upon their 10–6 record and defended their NFC North title from 2008, their first successful defense of a divisional title since they won six NFC Central titles in a row between 1973 and 1978. They beat the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Divisional Playoff at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, but lost the NFC Championship Game in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints, missing out on what would have been their first Super Bowl since Super Bowl XI in 1976. This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the \"Bountygate Game\" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season.\n\n Before the 1998 NFL season, the Minnesota Vikings had accumulated a history of disappointing losses despite maintaining a high level of competition. Although they were the first franchise to appear in four Super Bowls, they lost each time and became the first franchise to lose four Super Bowls as a result. They had not appeared in a Super Bowl since their fourth loss following the 1976 season, although they had come close in other seasons. In a 1975 Divisional round playoff game, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys as a result of a 50-yard touchdown pass from Roger Staubach to \n\n an NFC divisional game, on January 14, 2018, as the Vikings hosted the New Orleans Saints. The Vikings won the game 29–24 on a last second 61-yard catch by wide receiver Stefon Diggs, in a play that became known as the Minneapolis Miracle. The Vikings then advanced to the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, where the Vikings lost 38–7, costing the Vikings the chance to become the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its own home stadium. Super Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots with the Eagles winning 41-33 for their first Super Bowl win.\n\nQuestion: when was the last time minnesota vikings was in the super bowl\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The term is often applied to general-purpose computers and also in the field of scientific investigation into the theory and practical application of AI. A robot is an electro-mechanical or bio-mechanical device or group of devices that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks. An android is a robot made to resemble a human, usually both in appearance and behavior. The word derives from the Greek andr-, \" meaning \"man, male\", and the suffix -eides, used to mean \"of the species; alike\" (from eidos \"species\"). A cyborg is a cybernetic organism which adds to or enhances its abilities by using technology. A mecha is a large robotic mobile suit, sometimes piloted, sometimes remote-operated, and often used for combat or labor. Mechas usually come equipped with enhanced strength, rocket-propelled flight and an assortment of built-in weapons.\n\n A robotic humanoid, also known simply as a robot humanoid or robotoid, is an artificial lifeform that is created through processes that are totally different from cloning or synthetics. In short, it is the cybernetic equivalent of a humanoid. Perhaps the first mention of \"robotoid\" was in the Lost in Space episode War of the Robots which originally aired on February 9, 1966 and credits Robby the Robot as a robotoid and William Bramley and Ollie O'Toole as uncredited \"robotoid voice\" actors. In the episode, the Lost in Space robot says: \"It is more than a machine...it is a robotoid.\" The robot goes on to explain that as a \n\n technical developments to the forefront of fiction: R.U.R – Rossum’s Universal Robots, Karel Čapek’s play of sentient robots endowed with emotions used as slave labor is not only credited with the invention of the term ‘robot’ (derived from the Czech word for forced labor, robota) but was also an international success after it premiered in 1921. George Bernard Shaw's play Back to Methuselah, published in 1921, questions at one point the validity of thinking machines that act like humans; Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis shows an android leading the uprising of the exploited masses against the oppressive regime of a technocratic society.\n\n the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.\" The term made an impact into English pulp science fiction starting from Jack Williamson's The Cometeers (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by Edmond Hamilton's Captain Future stories (1940–1944). Although Karel Čapek's robots in R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1921)—the play that introduced the word robot to the world—were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings. The term \"android\" can mean either one of these, while a cyborg (\"cybernetic organism\" or \"bionic man\") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts. The term \"droid\", \n\n The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920. The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means work/job. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.
