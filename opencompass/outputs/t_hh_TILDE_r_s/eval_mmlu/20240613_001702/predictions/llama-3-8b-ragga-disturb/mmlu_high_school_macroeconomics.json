Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream economics and has been described as expressing \"the basic relationship between scarcity and choice\". The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently. It has the formula: Beginning Inventory (at the start of accounting period) + purchases (within the accounting period) + Production (within the accounting period) = cost of goods available for sale Notice that purchases and production might not be the same throughout the year, since purchase cost and production cost might vary. But at the end, the total cost of purchases and production are added to beginning inventory cost to give cost of goods available for sale. Alternatively the costs of goods available for sales can be computed from the costs of sales: Costs of goods available for sale − Ending Inventory − Inventory write-downs = Cost of goods sold\n\n The mobility of concert tours requires a lot of costs, time, and energy. ### THE TUFTS STUDY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATE BY  \nADDING A SPURIOUS \"OPPORTUNITY COST.\" That charge is the \"opportunity cost.\" John Stuart Mill introduced the concept of an opportunity cost as the cost of what one surrenders in one direction in order to pursue an investment in another. Investing in one arena, such as drug design, precludes spending those funds elsewhere, so you lose the benefits posed by the other opportunity. If, for example, I use $10 to buy a movie ticket instead of depositing the cash in a savings account, the opportunity cost is the interest I would have earned from the $10.

        "context": " The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser in the late 19th century. Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream economics and has been described as expressing \"the basic relationship between scarcity and choice\". The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently. It has the formula: Beginning Inventory (at the start of accounting period) + purchases (within the accounting period) + Production (within the accounting period) = cost of goods available for sale Notice that purchases and production might not be the same throughout the year, since purchase cost and production cost might vary. But at the end, the total cost of purchases and production are added to beginning inventory cost to give cost of goods available for sale. Alternatively the costs of goods available for sales can be computed from the costs of sales: Costs of goods available for sale − Ending Inventory − Inventory write-downs = Cost of goods sold\n\n The mobility of concert tours requires a lot of costs, time, and energy. ### THE TUFTS STUDY INFLATED ITS ESTIMATE BY  \nADDING A SPURIOUS \"OPPORTUNITY COST.\" That charge is the \"opportunity cost.\" John Stuart Mill introduced the concept of an opportunity cost as the cost of what one surrenders in one direction in order to pursue an investment in another. Investing in one arena, such as drug design, precludes spending those funds elsewhere, so you lose the benefits posed by the other opportunity. If, for example, I use $10 to buy a movie ticket instead of depositing the cash in a savings account, the opportunity cost is the interest I would have earned from the $10.

Their models show that, when the difference between short-term interest rates (using three-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (using ten-year Treasury notes) at the end of a Federal Reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs. Reserve requirements - specifies a required minimum percentage of deposits in a commercial bank that should be held as a reserve (i.e. as deposits with the Federal Reserve), with the rest available to loan or invest. Higher requirements mean less money loaned or invested, helping keep inflation in check.

As prices fall, a given nominal money supply will be associated with a larger real money supply, causing interest rates to fall and in turn causing investment spending on physical capital to increase.
