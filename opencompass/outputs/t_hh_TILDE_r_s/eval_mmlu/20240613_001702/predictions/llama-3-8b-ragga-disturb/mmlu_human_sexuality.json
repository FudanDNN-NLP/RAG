Many of those infected, however, have no symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms\nGonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women\nHalf of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants\n\nIf not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread\nThe infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis\n\nTraditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening \n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention \n\nAs with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow. Treatment\n\nAntibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat gonorrhea infections. Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications. Addition of topical antibiotics have not been shown to improve cure rates compared to oral antibiotics alone in treatment of eye infected gonorrhea. For newborns, erythromycin ointment is recommended as a preventative measure for gonococcal infant conjunctivitis. This is amplified by the fact that pharyngeal gonorrhoea is mostly asymptomatic, and gonococci and commensal Neisseria species can coexist for long time periods in the pharynx and share anti-microbial resistance genes. Accordingly, an enhanced focus on early detection (i.e., screening of high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men, PCR testing should be considered) and appropriate treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhoea is important. Sexual partners\nIt is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommend that individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for gonorrhea avoid sexual contact with others until at least one week past the final day of treatment in order to prevent the spread of the bacterium. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in five years. In 2016, the WHO published new guidelines for treatment, stating \"There is an urgent need to update treatment recommendations for gonococcal infections to respond to changing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of N. gonorrhoeae. High-level resistance to previously recommended quinolones is widespread and decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporins, another recommended first-line treatment in the 2003 guidelines, is increasing and several countries have reported treatment failures.\" Prognosis\n\nGonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or petechia, septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. In men, inflammation of the epididymis, prostate gland, and urethra can result from untreated gonorrhea. In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease. Men who have had a gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. Epidemiology\n\nAbout 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, out of the 448 million new cases of curable STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. In 2011, 321,849 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999. In 2004, the rate of reported gonorrheal infections was 113. In the US, it is the second-most-common bacterial sexually transmitted infections; chlamydia remains first. According to the CDC African Americans are most affected by gonorrhea, accounting for 69% of all gonorrhea cases in 2010. The World Health Organization warned in 2017 of the spread of untreatable strains of gonorrhea, following analysis of at least three cases in Japan, France and Spain, which survived all antibiotic treatment. In 1854, Dr. Wilhelm Gollmann addressed gonorrhea in his book, Homeopathic Guide to all Diseases Urinary and Sexual Organs. The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Research \nA vaccine for gonorrhea has been developed that is effective in mice. As N. gonorrhoeae is closely related to N. meningitidis and they have 80–90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines is plausible.

Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms\nGonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women\nHalf of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants\n\nIf not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread\nThe infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis\n\nTraditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening \n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention \n\nAs with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow. Treatment\n\nAntibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat gonorrhea infections. Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications. Addition of topical antibiotics have not been shown to improve cure rates compared to oral antibiotics alone in treatment of eye infected gonorrhea. For newborns, erythromycin ointment is recommended as a preventative measure for gonococcal infant conjunctivitis. This is amplified by the fact that pharyngeal gonorrhoea is mostly asymptomatic, and gonococci and commensal Neisseria species can coexist for long time periods in the pharynx and share anti-microbial resistance genes. Accordingly, an enhanced focus on early detection (i.e., screening of high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men, PCR testing should be considered) and appropriate treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhoea is important. Sexual partners\nIt is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommend that individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for gonorrhea avoid sexual contact with others until at least one week past the final day of treatment in order to prevent the spread of the bacterium. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in five years. In 2016, the WHO published new guidelines for treatment, stating \"There is an urgent need to update treatment recommendations for gonococcal infections to respond to changing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of N. gonorrhoeae. High-level resistance to previously recommended quinolones is widespread and decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporins, another recommended first-line treatment in the 2003 guidelines, is increasing and several countries have reported treatment failures.\" Prognosis\n\nGonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or petechia, septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. In men, inflammation of the epididymis, prostate gland, and urethra can result from untreated gonorrhea. In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease. Men who have had a gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. Epidemiology\n\nAbout 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, out of the 448 million new cases of curable STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. In 2011, 321,849 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999. In 2004, the rate of reported gonorrheal infections was 113. In the US, it is the second-most-common bacterial sexually transmitted infections; chlamydia remains first. According to the CDC African Americans are most affected by gonorrhea, accounting for 69% of all gonorrhea cases in 2010. The World Health Organization warned in 2017 of the spread of untreatable strains of gonorrhea, following analysis of at least three cases in Japan, France and Spain, which survived all antibiotic treatment. In 1854, Dr. Wilhelm Gollmann addressed gonorrhea in his book, Homeopathic Guide to all Diseases Urinary and Sexual Organs. The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Research \nA vaccine for gonorrhea has been developed that is effective in mice. As N. gonorrhoeae is closely related to N. meningitidis and they have 80–90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines is plausible.

In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and \n\nGender is correlated with the prevalence of certain mental disorders, including depression, anxiety and somatic complaints. For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women are more likely to develop different mental illnesses. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. Gender differences in mental health\n\nGender-specific risk factors \nGender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Men are less likely to seek treatment for or discuss their experiences with depression. Men are more likely to have depressive symptoms relating to aggression than women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health \nAdolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. reported that bullies were more likely to be rejected by peer groups who saw them as a possible threat. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Gender differences following a traumatic event\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. There are observed differences in the types of symptoms experienced by men and women. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. Epidemiological studies have found that men are more likely to have PTSD as a result of experiencing combat, war, accidents, nonsexual assaults, natural disaster, and witnessing death or injury. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. A history of sexual assault is related to increased rates of depression. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. Studies show that women have an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood, especially childhood sexual abuse. As with PTSD, evidence of a biological difference between men and women may contribute to the observed gender difference. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared to heterosexual men. Depression \nIndividuals who identify as non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming are more likely to experience depressive episodes and suicide attempts than those who identity as heterosexual. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB-identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. Suicide \nAs compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men are at a greater risk for suicide, attempting suicide, and dying of suicide. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Various risk factors may increase the likelihood of LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing disordered eating, including fear of rejection, internalized negativity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pressure to conform with body image ideals within the LGBTQ+ community. Gay men are also seven times more likely to report binge eating and twelve times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Gay and bisexual men also experience a higher prevalence of full-syndrome bulimia and all subclinical eating disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. Data collected from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18–65 found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical and sexual IPV. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Humphreys and Thiara (2003) assert that the body of existing research evidence shows a direct link between the experience of IPV and higher rates of self-harm, depression, and trauma symptoms. The NVAWS survey found that physical IPV was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, substance dependence problems, and chronic mental illness. Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not. Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. For men as well, domestic violence is correlated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal behavior. Sexual violence \nGlobal estimates published by the World Health Organization indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Many survivors are \"mentally marked by this trauma and report flashbacks of their assault, and feelings of shame, isolation, shock, confusion, and guilt.\" Sexual assault is also associated with higher rates of depression, self harm, suicide, and disordered eating. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Additionally, men are more likely to use problem-focused coping, which is known to decrease the risk of developing PTSD when a stressor is perceived to be within an individual's control. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. These described differences in coping mechanisms are in line with a preliminary model of sex-specific pathways to PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. In this model, variables such as dissociation, social support, and use of emotion-focused coping may be involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD in women, whereas physiological arousal, anxiety, avoidant coping, and use of problem-focused coping may be more likely to be related to the development and maintenance of PTSD in men. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These coping mechanisms tend to be developed during youth and early-adult life. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

Gender differences in mental health\n\nGender-specific risk factors \nGender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Men are less likely to seek treatment for or discuss their experiences with depression. Men are more likely to have depressive symptoms relating to aggression than women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health \nAdolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. reported that bullies were more likely to be rejected by peer groups who saw them as a possible threat. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Gender differences following a traumatic event\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. There are observed differences in the types of symptoms experienced by men and women. flashbacks), hypervigilance, feeling depressed and numbness. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. Epidemiological studies have found that men are more likely to have PTSD as a result of experiencing combat, war, accidents, nonsexual assaults, natural disaster, and witnessing death or injury. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. A history of sexual assault is related to increased rates of depression. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. Studies show that women have an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood, especially childhood sexual abuse. As with PTSD, evidence of a biological difference between men and women may contribute to the observed gender difference. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared to heterosexual men. Depression \nIndividuals who identify as non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming are more likely to experience depressive episodes and suicide attempts than those who identity as heterosexual. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB-identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. Suicide \nAs compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men are at a greater risk for suicide, attempting suicide, and dying of suicide. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Various risk factors may increase the likelihood of LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing disordered eating, including fear of rejection, internalized negativity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pressure to conform with body image ideals within the LGBTQ+ community. Gay men are also seven times more likely to report binge eating and twelve times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Gay and bisexual men also experience a higher prevalence of full-syndrome bulimia and all subclinical eating disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. Data collected from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18–65 found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical and sexual IPV. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Humphreys and Thiara (2003) assert that the body of existing research evidence shows a direct link between the experience of IPV and higher rates of self-harm, depression, and trauma symptoms. The NVAWS survey found that physical IPV was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, substance dependence problems, and chronic mental illness. Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not. Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. For men as well, domestic violence is correlated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal behavior. Sexual violence \nGlobal estimates published by the World Health Organization indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Many survivors are \"mentally marked by this trauma and report flashbacks of their assault, and feelings of shame, isolation, shock, confusion, and guilt.\" Sexual assault is also associated with higher rates of depression, self harm, suicide, and disordered eating. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Additionally, men are more likely to use problem-focused coping, which is known to decrease the risk of developing PTSD when a stressor is perceived to be within an individual's control. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. These described differences in coping mechanisms are in line with a preliminary model of sex-specific pathways to PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. In this model, variables such as dissociation, social support, and use of emotion-focused coping may be involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD in women, whereas physiological arousal, anxiety, avoidant coping, and use of problem-focused coping may be more likely to be related to the development and maintenance of PTSD in men. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These coping mechanisms tend to be developed during youth and early-adult life. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues.

The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared to heterosexual men. Depression \nIndividuals who identify as non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming are more likely to experience depressive episodes and suicide attempts than those who identity as heterosexual. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB-identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. Suicide \nAs compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men are at a greater risk for suicide, attempting suicide, and dying of suicide. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Various risk factors may increase the likelihood of LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing disordered eating, including fear of rejection, internalized negativity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pressure to conform with body image ideals within the LGBTQ+ community. Gay men are also seven times more likely to report binge eating and twelve times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Gay and bisexual men also experience a higher prevalence of full-syndrome bulimia and all subclinical eating disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. Data collected from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18–65 found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical and sexual IPV. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Humphreys and Thiara (2003) assert that the body of existing research evidence shows a direct link between the experience of IPV and higher rates of self-harm, depression, and trauma symptoms. The NVAWS survey found that physical IPV was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, substance dependence problems, and chronic mental illness. Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not. Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. For men as well, domestic violence is correlated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal behavior. Sexual violence \nGlobal estimates published by the World Health Organization indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Many survivors are \"mentally marked by this trauma and report flashbacks of their assault, and feelings of shame, isolation, shock, confusion, and guilt.\" Sexual assault is also associated with higher rates of depression, self harm, suicide, and disordered eating. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Additionally, men are more likely to use problem-focused coping, which is known to decrease the risk of developing PTSD when a stressor is perceived to be within an individual's control. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. These described differences in coping mechanisms are in line with a preliminary model of sex-specific pathways to PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. In this model, variables such as dissociation, social support, and use of emotion-focused coping may be involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD in women, whereas physiological arousal, anxiety, avoidant coping, and use of problem-focused coping may be more likely to be related to the development and maintenance of PTSD in men. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These coping mechanisms tend to be developed during youth and early-adult life. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

In research carried out by the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29%) who has experienced sexual harassment have said that they felt fearful as a result of the most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made themselves feel ashamed of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and \n\nGender is correlated with the prevalence of certain mental disorders, including depression, anxiety and somatic complaints. For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women are more likely to develop different mental illnesses. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. Gender differences in mental health\n\nGender-specific risk factors \nGender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Men are less likely to seek treatment for or discuss their experiences with depression. Men are more likely to have depressive symptoms relating to aggression than women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health \nAdolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. reported that bullies were more likely to be rejected by peer groups who saw them as a possible threat. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Gender differences following a traumatic event\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. There are observed differences in the types of symptoms experienced by men and women. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. Epidemiological studies have found that men are more likely to have PTSD as a result of experiencing combat, war, accidents, nonsexual assaults, natural disaster, and witnessing death or injury. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. A history of sexual assault is related to increased rates of depression. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. Studies show that women have an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood, especially childhood sexual abuse. As with PTSD, evidence of a biological difference between men and women may contribute to the observed gender difference. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia.

Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not. Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders. For men as well, domestic violence is correlated with a higher risk of depression and suicidal behavior. Sexual violence \nGlobal estimates published by the World Health Organization indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Many survivors are \"mentally marked by this trauma and report flashbacks of their assault, and feelings of shame, isolation, shock, confusion, and guilt.\" Sexual assault is also associated with higher rates of depression, self harm, suicide, and disordered eating. Women are more likely to be involved with pro-anorexia communities. These gendered differentials have been attributed to a variety of factors, including gendered socialization to internalize or externalize symptoms of distress, particularly in youth; clinician bias to perceive men as mentally healthy; gendered stereotypes regarding the types of disorders men and women are expected to experience, with emotional issues attributed to women and substance abuse issues to men; and stereotypes and allocation of resources based on, and reifying, these differences. Differential diagnosis rates are also related to differences in help-seeking or disclosure along gendered lines. Another instance in which such disparities emerged is in the use of lobotomies, popularized in the 1940s to treat a variety of psychiatric diagnoses including insomnia, nervousness, and more. Studies have found that US asylums disproportionately lobotomized women in spite of the fact that men made up the majority of asylum patients. Cisheteronormative Bias in Medicine \nImplicit bias in medicine also affect the way lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBTQ+) patients, are diagnosed by mental health physicians. Gender Normativity and Bias in Medicine \nIt has also been observed that mental health professionals may pathologize the behaviors of individuals who do not conform to the practitioner's gender ideals. Gender ideals have been found to influence understandings of mental health and illness at the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of symptomology or of treatment. Most social science research agrees upon the fact that there is a negative relationship between socioeconomic status and mental illness, that is lower socio-economic status is correlated with higher level of mental illness. \"Researchers have found this relationship to hold constant for almost any mental illness, from rare conditions like schizophrenia to more common mental illnesses like depression.\" Additionally, pregnancy negatively affects professional and educational opportunities for women since \"an unplanned pregnancies can prevent women from finishing their education or sustaining employment (Cawthorne, 2008)\". Finally, a low socioeconomic status puts women at higher risk of domestic and sexual violence, therefore increasing their exposure to all the mental disorder associated with this trauma. Indeed, \"statistics show that poverty increases people's vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation in the workplace, schools, and in prostitution, sex trafficking, and the drug trade and that people with the lowest socioeconomic status are at greater risk for violence\" (Jewkes, Sen, Garcia-Moreno, 2002). Biological differences\nResearch have been made on the effect of biological differences between male and female on the exposure to both Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder \nBiological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation. Additionally, men are more likely to use problem-focused coping, which is known to decrease the risk of developing PTSD when a stressor is perceived to be within an individual's control. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD. These described differences in coping mechanisms are in line with a preliminary model of sex-specific pathways to PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. In this model, variables such as dissociation, social support, and use of emotion-focused coping may be involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD in women, whereas physiological arousal, anxiety, avoidant coping, and use of problem-focused coping may be more likely to be related to the development and maintenance of PTSD in men. For more about gender differences in coping mechanisms, see the Coping (psychology) page. Oftentimes, the coping mechanism adopted by a person, depending on whether they are safe or risky, will impact their mental health. These coping mechanisms tend to be developed during youth and early-adult life. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

For example, women are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, while men are more likely to be diagnosed with substance abuse and antisocial personality disorder. There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and bipolar disorder. Men are at risk to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to past violent experiences such as accidents, wars and witnessing death, and women are diagnosed with PTSD at higher rates due to experiences with sexual assault, rape and child sexual abuse. Sigmund Freud postulated that women were more prone to neurosis because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as gender roles, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women are more likely to develop different mental illnesses. A patriarchal society, gender roles, personal identity, social media, and exposure to other mental health risk factors have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. Gender differences in mental health\n\nGender-specific risk factors \nGender-specific risk factors increase the likelihood of getting a particular mental disorder based on one's gender. Women are also twice as likely to develop specific phobias. Gender is not a significant factor in predicting the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions or cognitive behavioral therapy in treating GAD. This increased rate is partially related to women's increased likelihood to experience sexual violence, poverty, and higher workloads. Men are less likely to seek treatment for or discuss their experiences with depression. Men are more likely to have depressive symptoms relating to aggression than women. Between males and females, the symptoms experienced by those with eating disorders are very similar such as a distorted body image. Contrary to the stereotype of eating disorders' association with females, men also experience eating disorders. However, gender bias, stigma, and shame lead men to be underreported, underdiagnosed, and undertreated for eating disorders. Men with eating disorders are likely to experience muscle dysmorphia. Gender differences in adolescence and mental health \nAdolescents experience mental illness differently than an adult, as children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five. They have also posed that status enhancement is one of the main drives of bullying and a 1984 study by Kaj Björkqvist et al. showed that the motivation of male bullies between the ages of 14-16 was the status goal of establishing themselves as more dominant. A bully's gender and the gender of their target can impact whether they are accepted or rejected by a gender group, as a 2010 study by René Veenstra et al. reported that bullies were more likely to be rejected by peer groups who saw them as a possible threat. Females are more likely to have an eating disorder than males and scholars have stated that this has become more common \"during the latter half of the twentieth century, during a period when icons of American beauty (Miss America contestants and Playboy centerfolds) have become thinner and women’s magazines have published significantly more articles on methods for weight loss\". Research has reported that while adolescents share common risk factors such as interpersonal violence, existing mental disorders and substance abuse, gender specific risk factors for suicide attempts can include eating disorders, dating violence, and interpersonal problems for females and disruptive behavior/conduct problems, homelessness, and access to means. They also reported that females are more likely to attempt suicide than their male counterparts, whereas males are more likely to succeed in their attempts. This means that adolescents regularly compare themselves to the idealized bodies they see on social media causing them to develop self-deprecating attitudes. Both adolescent boys and girls are impacted by the objectifying nature of social media, however young girls are more likely to body surveil due to society's tendency to overvalue and objectify women. A study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence found that there is a significantly stronger correlation between self-objectified social media use, body surveillance, and body shame among young girls than young boys. The same studied emphasized that adolescence is an important psychological development period; therefore, opinions formed about oneself during this time can have a significant impact on self-confidence and self-worth. Gender differences following a traumatic event\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is among the most common reactions in response to a traumatic event. There are observed differences in the types of symptoms experienced by men and women. flashbacks), hypervigilance, feeling depressed and numbness. These differences are found to be persistent across cultures. Epidemiological studies have found that men are more likely to have PTSD as a result of experiencing combat, war, accidents, nonsexual assaults, natural disaster, and witnessing death or injury. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to different rates of exposure to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at a greater risk for developing PTSD. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD. A history of sexual assault is related to increased rates of depression. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault contributes to 35% of the gender difference in adult depression. Increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood also explains the observed gender difference in major depression. Studies show that women have an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood, especially childhood sexual abuse. As with PTSD, evidence of a biological difference between men and women may contribute to the observed gender difference. However, research on the biological differences of men and women who have experienced traumatic events is yet to be conclusive. Some risk factors that contribute to declining mental health are heteronormativity, discrimination, harassment, rejection (e.g., family rejection and social exclusion), stigma, prejudice, denial of civil and human rights, lack of access to mental health resources, lack of access to gender-affirming spaces (e.g., gender-appropriate facilities), and internalized homophobia. The structural circumstance where a non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming individual is embedded in significantly affects the potential sources of risk. Evidence shows that there is a direct association between LGBTQ+ individuals' development of severe mental illnesses and the exposure to discrimination. Several factors affect the lack of research on mental illness within non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities. The presence of the stigma affects individuals' access to treatment and is particularly present for non-heterosexual and gender non-conforming individuals with schizophrenia. Gay and bisexual men are more likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as compared to heterosexual men. Depression \nIndividuals who identify as non-heterosexual or gender non-conforming are more likely to experience depressive episodes and suicide attempts than those who identity as heterosexual. Transgender youth are nearly four times more likely to experience depression, as compared to their non-transgender peers. As compared to individuals with a level of certainty in their gender identity and sexuality (such as LGB-identified and heterosexual students), youth who are questioning their sexuality report higher levels of depression and worse psychological responses to bullying and victimization. Suicide \nAs compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men are at a greater risk for suicide, attempting suicide, and dying of suicide. Compared to heterosexual youth, LGB+ youth are twice as likely to feel suicidal and over four times as likely to attempt suicide. Youth who are questioning their gender identity and/or sexuality are two times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Bisexual youth have higher percentages of suicidality than lesbian and gay youth. However, as young sexual minority males mature into early adulthood, their rate of substance use increases. Various risk factors may increase the likelihood of LGBTQ+ individuals experiencing disordered eating, including fear of rejection, internalized negativity, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pressure to conform with body image ideals within the LGBTQ+ community. Gay men are also seven times more likely to report binge eating and twelve times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Gay and bisexual men also experience a higher prevalence of full-syndrome bulimia and all subclinical eating disorders than their heterosexual counterparts. Research has found lesbian women to have higher rates of weight-based self-worth and proneness to contracting eating disorders compared to gay men. Lesbian women also experience comparable rates of eating disorders compared to heterosexual women, with similar rates of dieting, binge eating and purging behaviours. However, lesbian women are more likely to report positive body image compared to heterosexual females (42.1% vs 20.5%). Causes of gender disparities in mental disorders\n\nIntimate partner violence \nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. Data collected from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18–65 found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical and sexual IPV. The United Nations estimates that \"35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives.\" Humphreys and Thiara (2003) assert that the body of existing research evidence shows a direct link between the experience of IPV and higher rates of self-harm, depression, and trauma symptoms. The NVAWS survey found that physical IPV was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, substance dependence problems, and chronic mental illness. Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not.

These coping mechanisms tend to be developed during youth and early-adult life. These risky mechanisms involve strategies such as self-harm, substance abuse, or risky sexual behavior for many reasons, including; \"attempting to get away from or not feel overwhelming emotions, gaining a sense of control, self-punishment, nonverbally communicating their struggles to others.\" Once adopted, these coping mechanisms tend to stick to the person and therefore endanger even more the future mental health of LGBTQ+ patients, reinforcing their exposure to depression, extreme anxiety and suicide.

One of the main factors is the belief that sexual activity should be restricted to certain situations or within specific boundaries in order to maintain moral and spiritual purity. Religions often view sexuality as a powerful force that needs to be channeled in a way that promotes harmony, fidelity, and family stability. Another factor is the focus on procreation and the importance of creating and raising healthy offspring. Many religions view sexual activity primarily as a means of reproduction and therefore place a strong emphasis on responsible and purposeful sexual behavior within the context of marriage. This emphasis is often rooted in the desire to ensure the continuation of the religious community and to fulfill the divine commandment to be fruitful and multiply. Additionally, social and cultural norms play a significant role in shaping the emphasis on sexual behavior within religions. These norms are often influenced by historical, geographical, and cultural factors, which can vary widely among different religious traditions. The interpretations of religious texts and teachings also contribute to the specific emphasis placed on sexual behavior within each religion. It is important to note that while many religions emphasize sexual morality, the specific teachings and practices regarding sexual behavior can differ greatly among different religious traditions. The variations are influenced by the foundational beliefs, cultural contexts, and historical developments of each religion. Overall, the emphasis on sexual behavior in world religions is influenced by a combination of moral, procreative, social, and cultural factors, all of which contribute to the formation of religious teachings and practices regarding sexuality. Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity. Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force. Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework. Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity. Whereas sex therapists discuss and instruct clients in sex-based exercises to be performed at home between sessions, sexual surrogates participate in the exercises with their clients as part of helping them to practice and develop improved skills. Today, sexual problems are no longer regarded as symptoms of hidden deviant, pathological, or psychological defects in maturity or development. Sex therapy has also influenced the emergence of sexual medicine and exploring integrative approaches to sex therapy, in addition to reducing or eliminating sexual problems and increasing sexual satisfaction for individuals of all stages of life. Health therapists, educators, and counselors are conducting research and administering surveys to fully understand normative sexual function – what most people do and experience as they grow older and live longer. These physical changes often affect the intensity of youthful sex and may give way to more subdued responses during middle and later life. As the population of older adults and life expectancy continue to grow, there is information about sex therapy but it is often not easily accepted. Cultural and sexual roles are always changing throughout the lifecourse. Curriculum for this includes communication, masturbation, body image, and spirituality. It is optimal that sex education for older adults includes information about sexually transmitted infections (STDs/STIs), such as HIV/AIDS. History \nSex therapy has existed in different cultures throughout time, including ancient India, China, Greece, and Rome. It has taken the form of manuals, spells, anaphrodisiacs or aphrodisiacs, and tantric yoga, among others. Much of sex therapy and sexual dysfunction in Western cultures was limited to scientific discussion, especially throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century. Sexologists such as Henry Havelock Ellis and Alfred Kinsey began conducting research in the area of human sexuality during the first half of the 20th century. In the 1950s, sex therapy was concerned with \"controlling sexual expression\" and repressing what was then-considered deviant behaviors, such as homosexuality or having sex too often. Robboy, Alex Caroline, \"How to Become a Sex Therapist\"\n\nMerleau-Ponty integrates Freud's concept of sexuality into the totality of a person's behavior without reducing it to a blind or instinctive force by emphasizing the significance and meaning of sexuality in human behavior. In his works, Merleau-Ponty recognizes the importance of Freud's understanding of sexuality and its impact on an individual's experience. He views sexuality as a meaningful aspect of human behavior, giving it significance beyond being a mere biological or physiological urge. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of human behavior and sexuality, enabling therapists and researchers to incorporate these insights into their therapeutic work and psychological studies. Religions have had differing views about love and sexual relations between people of the same sex. A large proportion of the Abrahamic sects view sexual relationships outside of a heterosexual marriage, including sex between same-sex partners, negatively, though there are groups within each faith that disagree with orthodox positions and challenge their doctrinal authority.

According to Freud, during this stage, children develop unconscious sexual desires towards the parent of the opposite sex, known as the Oedipus or Electra complex.

One of the more prominent concepts pertaining to love was proposed by Robert J. Sternberg known as the \"Triangular theory of love\". The three sides are Intimacy, Passion, and Commitment. For example, Intimacy plus Passion leads to romantic love while Intimacy plus Commitment leads to compassionate love. The relative amount of love invested is explained by the size and general form of the triangle. Triangular theories do not solely apply to one's own current relationship, they also can be meant for explaining what different levels of intimacy/passion/commitment mean in an imbalanced triangle, or even determine your love triangle for a preference of relationship. There are great moments and also tough moments that come along within a relationship. Many specialists suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise is wise to continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy. Couples \n\nIn the first stage of love, sex appeal initially attracts partners to each other, which may lead to intimacy (connectedness and bonding with each other in a loving relationship).According to this theory, love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment.Paternal inheritance was effective in preventing the depletion of farmland. In addition, different parts of the brain play important roles in the perception of romantic love. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens area of the brain is activated when a person who is madly in love is dumped by the partner.12 Therefore, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach in humans rather than as a purely emotional endeavor. Several psychologists have attempted to define romantic love from a different standpoint. In general, romantic love has three components: attachment, caregiving, and sex.13 Sternberg postulated a triangular theory of love. According to this theory, love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment. In the first stage of love, sex appeal initially attracts partners to each other, which may lead to intimacy (connectedness and bonding with each other in a loving relationship).In the last step, a decision may be made by both partners to continue the romantic relation, or it may be a commitment in which both partners are committed to each other and to continuing the love for a long time.14\n\nLarge Brain and Monogamy\n\nOne of the biological bases of human monogamy may be related to the large brain size of humans compared to the body.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

        "context": " Social psychological approaches to explaining love have been developed to help further explain the psychological components involved in love. One of the more prominent concepts pertaining to love was proposed by Robert J. Sternberg known as the \"Triangular theory of love\". The three sides are Intimacy, Passion, and Commitment. For example, Intimacy plus Passion leads to romantic love while Intimacy plus Commitment leads to compassionate love. The relative amount of love invested is explained by the size and general form of the triangle. Triangular theories do not solely apply to one's own current relationship, they also can be meant for explaining what different levels of intimacy/passion/commitment mean in an imbalanced triangle, or even determine your love triangle for a preference of relationship. There are great moments and also tough moments that come along within a relationship. Many specialists suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise is wise to continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy.

In addition, different parts of the brain play important roles in the perception of romantic love. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens area of the brain is activated when a person who is madly in love is dumped by the partner.12 Therefore, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach in humans rather than as a purely emotional endeavor. Several psychologists have attempted to define romantic love from a different standpoint.

In general, however, it encourages abortion when the pregnancy endangers the woman's life and permits it if it will cause her severe physical or psychological harm. In the absence of clear threats to a mother's life, the permissibility of abortion is a controversial issue in Jewish texts. Groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as \"pro-life\" while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as \"pro-choice\". Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a human person with a right to live, making abortion morally the same as murder. The historical relationship between Christianity and abortion is complex and varied. However, it's important to note that interpretations and attitudes towards abortion within Christianity have evolved over time. Some denominations, such as the Roman Catholic Church and many conservative Protestant denominations, strongly oppose abortion and consider it morally wrong. Overall, Christianity's stance on abortion varies among different denominations and individual believers based on their interpretation of scripture and ethical considerations. Please note that this response provides an overview without endorsing or promoting any specific viewpoint or belief system surrounding Christianity and its stance on abortion. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. Those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is a person with a right to life, and thus equate abortion with murder. Others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure. A 2014 Guttmacher survey of US abortion patients found that many reported a religious affiliation—24% were Catholic while 30% were Protestant. A 1995 survey reported that Catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy, Protestants are less likely to do so, and Evangelical Christians are the least likely to do so.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.
