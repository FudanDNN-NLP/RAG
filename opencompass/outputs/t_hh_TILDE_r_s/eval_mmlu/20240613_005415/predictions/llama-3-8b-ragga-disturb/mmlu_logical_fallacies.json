If one accepts the principle of fallibilism then one also has to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section, source criticism is intimately linked to scientific methods. The presence of fallacies of argument in sources is another kind of philosophical criterion for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the ad hominem fallacy (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the straw man fallacy (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that eyewitness memory is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. In psychoanalysis the concept of defence mechanism is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources. Circumstantial ad hominem is an attack on the bias of a source. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim. Circumstantial ad hominem arguments are not necessarily fallacious. They can be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid (this overlaps with the genetic fallacy – an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). They can also be sound arguments if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B), making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, for example, B speaks from their position as an authority figure. Health professionals should possess several skills in order to distinguish evidence from propaganda, probability from certainty, data from assertions, rational belief from superstitions, and science from folklore. These skills are crucial for making informed decisions based on reliable information. By understanding research methods and study designs, health professionals can determine whether the evidence presented is trustworthy. This involves being able to analyze arguments and identify logical fallacies or biases that may be present. By questioning assumptions and examining the reasoning behind claims, health professionals can separate rational beliefs from superstitions or unfounded assertions. Some cognitive errors, fallacies, and biases that contribute to the persistence of ineffective treatments in healthcare include:\n\n1.
