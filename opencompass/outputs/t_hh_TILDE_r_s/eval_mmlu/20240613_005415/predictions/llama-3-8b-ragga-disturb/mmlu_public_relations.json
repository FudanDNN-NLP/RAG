As many of you may know, Skin-Cap was a popular over-the-counter (OTC) spray product that claimed its only active ingredient was zinc pyrithione, an ingredient approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OTC products in treating dandruff. The FDA removed it from the consumer market in August 1997 because the FDA determined that it contained a prescription medication that was not listed on the label. Congressional law requires all medications containing prescription ingredients be approved and regulated by the FDA to ensure that consumers are aware of the benefits and side effects of the drugs. Cheminova, the Spanish manufacturer of Skin-Cap, did not disclose that its product contained a prescription ingredient nor did the company submit an application to the FDA for the product's approval for sale in the U.S. More than 100 Skin-Cap users told the NPF that the product caused severe adverse reactions, and several dermatologists reported similar experiences in some of their Skin-Cap patients, who in some cases required hospitalization. Because of the overwhelming interest in this issue, both from people who liked Skin-Cap and wanted it back, and from people who were concerned about its side effects, the NPF decided to investigate the composition of Skin-Cap and what might be necessary to bring it back to the consumer market. An overview is presented in the letter below and the details are provided in the accompanying questions and answers. That's why we initiated our Skin-Cap investigation more than two years ago, to learn what might be done to get someone to bring it back to the market, and, toward that end, to possibly identify any additional unlisted ingredients. We brought this issue to two companies that seriously considered the product, and one may be pursuing testing at this time. We appeal to Cheminova to disclose the full list of Skin-Cap ingredients and to go through the established legal channels to seek approval of the product and re-introduction to the U.S. market. An FDA representative has advised us the agency is willing to review an application for approval of a Skin-Cap-type product. If the company continues to show no interest in pursuing legal channels of approval, someone else would have to conduct an expensive full-scale analysis of Skin-Cap to identify all of the ingredients. You may ask for Corrine Kail at extension 16, or e-mail us at questions@npfusa.org. What would be required to bring a Skin-Cap product back to the U.S. market? The most obvious way to get Skin-Cap back on the U.S. market would be for Cheminova to submit the product to the FDA for approval, which would involve clinical trials to demonstrate that it works and that it is safe. In lieu of that, another pharmaceutical company could try to bring a similar product to market, but this would require knowledge of the product's exact ingredients. As no one other than Cheminova knows exactly what is in Skin-Cap, the product would have to be reverse engineered to identify all of its ingredients. The independent laboratory that assisted us with our Skin-Cap testing said that to reverse engineer the product and figure out exactly what was in it would require an investment of at least one year and several hundred thousand dollars -- money the NPF does not have. Even if the product's ingredients could be identified, it would still need to be a prescription medication (due to the clobetasol propionate), and it would require millions of dollars to conduct the necessary clinical trials to prove its safety. Because the testing and development process that is required for prescription products can take 5-7 years, at a minimum expense of $20 million, a company would have to be convinced that the product would be very promising to warrant such an investment. It is clear that because Skin-Cap is such a complicated substance, a company wanting to try to bring a Skin-Cap-type product to the market would face millions of dollars in costs, years of development and a very uncertain outcome. What might be done to get someone to bring Skin-Cap back to the market legitimately? We explored the possibility and the costs for someone to reverse engineer Skin-Cap, and we researched the steps that would be required to bring such a product to market legally. All companies with available prescription clobetasol propionate products (such as Temovate and others) have conducted all of the necessary tests and clinical trials required by law to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and have identified all of their product's ingredients. How do Skin-Cap or \"clone\" distributors get my name, address or phone number to continue to contact me? If you ever made an inquiry or purchased Skin-Cap, the distributors still have your contact information. Beyond that, the NPF does not know how your name would be obtained by these marketing companies. Overall, several major companies have recalled more than 5300 pet food products, with most of the recalls coming from Menu Foods. The contamination was caused by melamine in the affected foods. The Chinese company behind the contaminated wheat gluten has initially denied any involvement in the contamination, but is cooperating with Chinese and American investigators. The affected products were produced from June 2015 through September 2015. The contaminated products were distributed in the United States and worldwide, including in Canada and Australia. On March 16, 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration, responding to recalls of contaminated products sold by Gilchrist and after inspecting its plant, issued a warning letter to the company noting violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and mandating extensive corrective actions, resulting in a temporary shutdown of parts of Gilchrist's manufacturing plant.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about public relations.
