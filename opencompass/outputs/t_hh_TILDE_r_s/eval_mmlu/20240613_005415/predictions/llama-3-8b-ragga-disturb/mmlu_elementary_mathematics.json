But concussions are a concern in soccer, too, and scientists are turning their attention to the sport. Most people don’t think of soccer as a contact sport.

Soccer is played by millions of kids at all age levels, so concussion education and research related to prevention is critical. A good starting point is the U.S. Soccer Federation’s policy that strictly limits headers in youth soccer. Set in 2015, it prohibits players under age 10 from heading the ball and reduces headers during practice for players aged 11 to 13. Lipton hopes to find the answer by tracking about 400 recreational soccer players for several years. Lipton found in an earlier study of about 37 players that heading the ball is associated with cognitive setbacks and changes to the brain structure. Observation of the players revealed that they head the ball an average of six to 12 times each game. Players headed balls up to 30 times during practice drills.

Your doctor will periodically measure your heart rate to collect important information about your heart health. A above average heart rate may be a warning sign of a viral or bacterial infection or a case of dehydration. A normal resting heart rate for adults is 60 to 100 beats per minute, depending on the person. Infants typically have a resting heart rate of between 100 and 160 beats per minute, and children up to 10 years maintain a resting heart rate of 70 to 120 beats per minute. Professional athletes who are in peak condition often have resting heart rates between 40 to 60 beats per minute because their heart is much more efficient due to substantial levels of exercise. Resting heart rates that are high can indicate heart problems and must be taken very seriously. If you have an abnormally high resting heart rate, you should contact your health care provider for diagnosis. Resting heart rates that are significantly below normal are also a cause for concern and should also be discussed with your health care provider.\n\n"

If the set contains an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the set contains an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. In the event that the upper and lower weighted medians are equal, the lower weighted median is generally accepted as originally proposed by Edgeworth. For simplicity, consider the set of numbers respectively. However, it is more ideal to take the mean of these weighted medians when it makes sense instead. Coincidentally, both the weighted median and median are equal to 2.5, but this will not always hold true for larger sets depending on the weight distribution. The middle value of a series of given data, arranged in either ascending or descending order, is called the median. The median is an essential measure of central tendency and is often used in statistics and data analysis. To find the median, you need to arrange the given data in order from least to greatest or vice versa. For example, if the data set has values {3, 6, 8, 10, 15}, the median is 8, which is the value in the middle. To find the median, we calculate the average of 7 and 9, resulting in a median of 8. The median is a useful measure because it is not influenced by extreme values, also known as outliers, which can significantly affect the mean or average of a data set. In summary, the middle value of a series of given data arranged in ascending or descending order is called the median. The median is a robust measure of central tendency that is not affected by outliers.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about elementary mathematics.
