The significance of a 95% confidence interval lies in its ability to provide an estimated range within which the true population parameter is expected to occur. A 95% confidence interval implies that if the study were to be repeated multiple times within the same sample population, the confidence interval estimates would contain the true population parameter 95% of the time. A 95% confidence interval indicates that the probability of observing the true value outside of this range is less than 0.05. Therefore, there is a 5% chance of observing a value that does not represent the true parameter. It is important to note that a 95% confidence interval does not imply a 95% probability that the true parameter falls within the specific range calculated in a single study. Instead, it suggests that if the study were repeated numerous times, the true parameter would fall within the confidence interval in 95% of those repetitions. This reflected a probability of 1 in 20 that the null hypothesis (no effect or no difference) was rejected based on the results from the study sample.

In summary, a 95% confidence interval provides an estimated range within which the true population parameter is expected to occur. It provides a range of plausible values within which the true parameter value is likely to fall. In the case of a 95% confidence interval, it means that if we were to repeat the sampling process multiple times, approximately 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter.
