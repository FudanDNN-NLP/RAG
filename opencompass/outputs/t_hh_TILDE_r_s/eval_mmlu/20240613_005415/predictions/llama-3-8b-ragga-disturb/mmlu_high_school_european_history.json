Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. It looks good on the outside, but it has no true function. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How often is my motive the love of God and the love of neighbour and how often is it something else? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Where is the destination for your life? It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It was only halfway through the class before he realized she was going to be ok that he finally relaxed. During the Olympics we saw glimpses of love when a winning athlete would run into the arms of a mother or father for a long and tearful embrace. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). .\" Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. South Alabama was playing Nicholls State from Thibodaux, Louisiana and one of their players was injured. We waited as the trainers attended him but when the cart wheeled onto the field we realized it might be more serious that just a pulled muscle or a cramp. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. More than 3,051 children lost parents. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. The life of service does not stop because one has clocked out. Many who did so never returned. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. I remember at the end of my pregnancy with our youngest daughter Emmie, I was working full time at a busy University Center Labor & Delivery. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\". His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He fed them. Basically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing. I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\" Now, I had never wanted to be a nurse, had never planned to be a nurse, had never prepared to be a nurse. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I had not taken Chemistry in high school and I would need it to get into nurses' training. I couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. I couldn't take it in night school either. My only choice was to take it in college. I took Chemistry in the accelerated session between the Spring and Summer semester. At least I had a friend in my instructor. When he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. During that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I now qualify for the senior coffee at McDonald's with a free refill, too! The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. de Marillac.

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that?

You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you.

Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days.

As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. South Alabama was playing Nicholls State from Thibodaux, Louisiana and one of their players was injured. We waited as the trainers attended him but when the cart wheeled onto the field we realized it might be more serious that just a pulled muscle or a cramp. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. More than 3,051 children lost parents. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. The life of service does not stop because one has clocked out. Many who did so never returned. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. I remember at the end of my pregnancy with our youngest daughter Emmie, I was working full time at a busy University Center Labor & Delivery. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\". His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He fed them. Basically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing. I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\" Now, I had never wanted to be a nurse, had never planned to be a nurse, had never prepared to be a nurse. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I had not taken Chemistry in high school and I would need it to get into nurses' training. I couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. I couldn't take it in night school either. My only choice was to take it in college. I took Chemistry in the accelerated session between the Spring and Summer semester. At least I had a friend in my instructor. When he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. During that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I now qualify for the senior coffee at McDonald's with a free refill, too! The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. de Marillac.

We see instead slaves dragging their eternal chains along the streets, but these are not slaves torn from their torrid climates and condemned for no faults of theirs to minister to the grandeur of their makers, they are the slaves of crime, and if I may be allowed the expression, carry the gallows chained to their legs. Here the starkest crimes are never punished by death but with bondage but I know not if this has \n\nA Pox Upon You. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Our son has not yet decided how he will arrive, but I doubt he will drive. Regardless of our method of transportation, we each have one thing in common: we have a destination. In our case, we have the same destination. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. The Lord our God is and has been eternal, He has always been and will always be exactly what He is and He will never do anything which contradicts His nature and character. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). We live in a sub-tropical location, and our city is the only seaport in our state. The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. Our city has 118 miles of land area and 41 miles of water area. Not only do we have water all around, but we have water from above, too. Our elevation above all that water is between 10 and 200 feet, depending upon where you live. You see, we don't really have \"winter\" as much of the country experiences winter. More than \"winter\" we have an absence of summer, a respite from that heat and humidity. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). Let us avail ourselves of the promises that have been set before us, to give us hope and comfort regarding those things yet to be. As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. Our contact is not neutral. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Basically a shy person, I'm not one to strike up a conversation with strangers too much -- that's what my husband does. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. She had been a positive influence, encouraging me in my walk with the Lord. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. Let us not lose the opportunities that abound around us. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. The crowd was clearly moved. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\" As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. More than 3,051 children lost parents. There were 327 foreign nationals killed from 53 countries. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. Many who did so never returned. We have a great land. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. We can trust Him because He IS good. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road.

He watered them. He fed them. When the tomatoes came, he covered the plants with netting to prevent the birds and the squirrels from helping themselves to a meal.

Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. We don't have to be concerned with the fruit produced in our lives. If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n—Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\nA.

Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Our son has not yet decided how he will arrive, but I doubt he will drive. Regardless of our method of transportation, we each have one thing in common: we have a destination. In our case, we have the same destination. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. The Lord our God is and has been eternal, He has always been and will always be exactly what He is and He will never do anything which contradicts His nature and character. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). We live in a sub-tropical location, and our city is the only seaport in our state. The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. Our city has 118 miles of land area and 41 miles of water area. Not only do we have water all around, but we have water from above, too. Our elevation above all that water is between 10 and 200 feet, depending upon where you live. You see, we don't really have \"winter\" as much of the country experiences winter. More than \"winter\" we have an absence of summer, a respite from that heat and humidity. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). Let us avail ourselves of the promises that have been set before us, to give us hope and comfort regarding those things yet to be. As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. Our contact is not neutral. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Basically a shy person, I'm not one to strike up a conversation with strangers too much -- that's what my husband does. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. She had been a positive influence, encouraging me in my walk with the Lord. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. Let us not lose the opportunities that abound around us. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. The crowd was clearly moved. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\" As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. More than 3,051 children lost parents. There were 327 foreign nationals killed from 53 countries. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. Many who did so never returned. We have a great land. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. We can trust Him because He IS good. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\".

Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. Many of the systems will not allow you to use a password you have ever used on that system before. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. \". from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. It looks good on the outside, but it has no true function. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. I have pondered this often. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How often is my motive the love of God and the love of neighbour and how often is it something else? How often is it to be well-thought of, or to be thought of as a \"good person\"? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Regardless of our method of transportation, we each have one thing in common: we have a destination. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Even if you plan to enjoy the journey, as we do with the train ride, the main point is to get somewhere. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It will be too late when the train pulls into the station, or when the plane lands on the tarmac to change your mind. It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. The Lord our God is and has been eternal, He has always been and will always be exactly what He is and He will never do anything which contradicts His nature and character. We can have faith that our Lord will always be for us in every situation exactly what we need Him to be, that He will always be working out His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus in our lives and that He is always for us. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have watched as mother, and father, cry and joy over their new child. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It was only halfway through the class before he realized she was going to be ok that he finally relaxed. During the Olympics we saw glimpses of love when a winning athlete would run into the arms of a mother or father for a long and tearful embrace. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). We live in a sub-tropical location, and our city is the only seaport in our state. The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. A 2007 study determined that Mobile is the wettest city in the contiguous 48 states, with 66.3 inches of average annual rainfall over a 30-year period. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). Let us avail ourselves of the promises that have been set before us, to give us hope and comfort regarding those things yet to be. As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. I guess it was inevitable with a nickname of \"Frannie\" that when I became a grandmother I would be called \"Grannie Frannie.\" .\" I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact. slowly he knew he had plenty of time to go back and get it. I had been called into work on my day off, had just gotten off and was tired. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. But I answered her questions: Did I just leave work? Was I a nurse? Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. She had been a positive influence, encouraging me in my walk with the Lord. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. Let us not lose the opportunities that abound around us. South Alabama was playing Nicholls State from Thibodaux, Louisiana and one of their players was injured. We waited as the trainers attended him but when the cart wheeled onto the field we realized it might be more serious that just a pulled muscle or a cramp. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. They motioned for the Nicholls State players on the field to join them and together the two teams prayed for the wounded player. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. On the day when 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in America, 1609 people lost a spouse or partner. More than 3,051 children lost parents. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. As the mother of a police officer, and as a nurse, I understand that sense of duty. The life of service does not stop because one has clocked out. Many who did so never returned. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. In fact, He will be for us \"abundantly above all that we ask or think.\" We can trust Him because He IS good. Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" I remember at the end of my pregnancy with our youngest daughter Emmie, I was working full time at a busy University Center Labor & Delivery. There was little sleep. The first night, someone came in my room for some reason or other at least every hour during the night. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. If that be the case, what have we to fear, of what cause is there to worry? Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Then he asked her about me, \"Is she a charge nurse or something?\" Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\". The Lord Jesus Christ is the express image of God...He is the earthly expression of God the Father and God the Spirit. His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He fed them. Basically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. \"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19). We don't have to be concerned with the fruit produced in our lives. If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing. I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. A few weeks before I was to leave home I decided I just didn't want to go. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\" Now, I had never wanted to be a nurse, had never planned to be a nurse, had never prepared to be a nurse. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I had not taken Chemistry in high school and I would need it to get into nurses' training. I couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. I couldn't take it in night school either. My only choice was to take it in college. Ouch! I took Chemistry in the accelerated session between the Spring and Summer semester. At least I had a friend in my instructor. When he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry. The next fall I started the nursing program and graduated without any problems, even though falling in love during that time presented a huge distraction. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. To this day I can still remember my answer, \"Why would anyone want to work in Labor & Delivery?\" God has a sense of humor, doesn't He? I worked in the Cardiac department of that hospital for three months by the calendar and three years by how it felt to me. During that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors. I have now worked in Labor & Delivery for twenty-nine years. It has been the most incredible blessing to witness the miracle of birth over and over again -- and each time it is indeed a miracle. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. I now qualify for the senior coffee at McDonald's with a free refill, too! That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. And thus he travayled seven yere In many a land bothe farre and nere, Tyll on a day he thought hym tho Unto the sepulture for to go. Having done all this he returns to Hungary. Here the princess, still lamenting her supposedly dead lover, has decided to retire from the world: \"And, squyer, for the love of thee, Fy on this worldes vanyté! Farewell golde pure and fyne; Farewell velvet and satyne; Farewell castelles and maners also; Farewell huntynge and hawkynge to; Farewell revell, \n\nIt looks like we have a few more rough days ahead of us. Amphotericin is an anti-fungal medicine, of which I remember nothing from medical school except it's nickname, ampho-terrible, named due to it's uncomfortable side effects. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. They always send something for the walls. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. He received some huge balloons, one of which sang the song, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\". Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! He's liberated in every sense of the word. He and Sophie immediately started playing, and within minutes they were running around the room screaming and jumping as a remote control Tow-mater chased them. Henry then cut off various limbs of his family members, and finally decided to use the chainsaw to give some My Little Ponies a hair cut. It's a little hard for him after his sisters go home, but he really had a ball. He rode the bike out in the hallway and accompanied me to do laundry and down to get my lunch. We are allowed this freedom as he was unhooked at our request for a brief period of time today. As long as he's bathed and changed before we adventure out (and refrain from touching things) we can go where we please for now, despite our 'isolation'. I was able to distract him and he accepted it for now. He had some down time in the afternoon and then engaged his nurse with some play about his workbench. She indulged him very enthusiastically. A big relief from what was expected. Today is considered Day Zero, or the day he gets his stem cells, that were harvested from him 3 months ago, put back into his body. On the one hand, everyone tells us that it’s just like hanging another bag of medication, which runs in uneventfully. So now we wait for that to happen over the next two weeks. He woke happily and has spent all day in bed. They had done a stool culture and found something called VRE. To prevent passing it on to others however, he must now be put in ‘isolation’. Sometime during the first game, a child about Henry's age won and picked that train. Each time, she would say something like 'pass the phone' and Henry thought it was his newly chosen prize being taken again. They called 'G - Bottle' and that did it for us. He was very proud of his prize and showed all the nurses that came in and promised to call them on it. After all, this is his life and his struggle. He's being forged into such a champion each day. I fell very easily into the rhythm of our new home life and had put behind me the first phase of chemotherapy as difficult but over. This reflection was tossed among the daily rituals that have become normalized in our new view of reality. I felt like I'd come to a calm acceptance of day to day living within our new situation and withheld looking too far into the future for fear of becoming too attached to a positive outcome or too overwhelmed by a negative one. The several days immediately preceding Henry's most recent admission, began to weigh heavier and heavier upon me, a sense of dread mounting with each out patient visit to have him tested for his current functions so we could recognize what the chemotherapy had done to him. At some point during this time, I began to see the chemotherapy, not as medicine, but poison. We were planning to poison my son, because nothing else had any chance of preserving his life. The effects of this poison were to leave him, and those around him for that matter, scarred for life. Hopefully these scars would be minimal - small crosses to bear, the likes of which affect some at random anyhow - infertility or hearing loss for example. This knowledge and the pause before commencing the treatment, left me to stew on the possible outcomes, no longer able to preserve my shelter of ignorance. For the first time since Henry's diagnosis, I found myself angry at this situation. It wasn't a 'why us' kind of anger, but a frustrated, having-been-backed-into-a-corner kind of anger. There was nothing to do but accept it. No pleasure to be taken that would alleviate it. With full knowledge of it's effects, we would administer this poison to our son, hoping that it killed it's target before it ravaged him. I withdrew into myself, not really understanding my feelings well enough to talk about them to anyone. I exercised, meditated, ate better food, tried to relax; all attempts to calm myself about it. Nothing would change what was about to happen. It wasn't until I had my first turn in the hospital with him, seeing him doing well - laughing, playing and entertaining - that I was able to better accept our path. I woke up to a new level of realization and with it, a new wave of grief. Momentarily lifting my head out of my anxiety for our future, I found the effects of Henry's diagnosis rippling out to so many people, some very close and some at a distance. I realized that I've not been as attentive to those immediately around me - my daughters, what is this doing to them? I picture their sweet faces looking up at me with a sad, innocent and inquiring look, eyes welled with tears. I look at my wife and imagine us on our wedding day, never guessing what could lie ahead, wishing to avoid things like this. I see our parents being supportive but looking behind their eyes - I see their empathy for us and their own plight of having a grandchild with cancer, wanting so desperately to help or fix things and not being able to; our relatives, watching and being supportive where possible, going about their normal days only to be reminded suddenly of what's going on at odd moments throughout the day; circles of friends feeling helpless but offering such wonderful support despite it all; parents of our children's friends trying to give answers to their kids - knowing that no kid should have to worry about such things; barely beginning to appreciate the years and years of treatments those families we see in the clinic have endured and are to yet endure; watching kids during chemotherapy and seeing them colorful and playful one minute and ashen and sickly the next. Other days I feel capable, but wary because I know it's simply a function of time before that changes. In lieu of describing this whirlwind of emotions, my answers are brief and guarded when others ask how we're doing. When people marvel at how we're 'doing it all', I have to think, 'if you only knew'. Yes, there are opportunities for growth in all of this. Adversity does that. But it's difficult to take solace in that. It's a difficult pill to swallow that one's growth is coming at such an expense. But what are we to do? In the face of such a crisis, we pick ourselves up, arming ourselves with the comfort and support of family and friends and make the effort to take one step, one day, one moment at a time. He was, unbelievably, quite eager to come. Due to the immune suppression that he'll have, there are some nursing (and therefore parenting) issues that will be new to us this time. The degree of discomfort varies from patient to patient. It sounds like he handled the first three cycles better than a lot of kids do, so we're hopeful we'll continue to have the same luck. It's what they told us to expect, but with the insurance as the critical dependency, I was kind of hoping for one more weekend. I have this strange conflicting irritation with the kids' minute-by-minute demands whenever we are expecting the hospital. I get frustrated with myself for it, because I feel I should be more patient and appreciative of them at such a time. Having a child with cancer alters your dreams. It changes your perceptions of the world, the people you interact with and the long-held beliefs about everything from what one should expect from everyday life to the metaphysical questions of why we're here. Today we were given a glimpse of the road ahead and there are significant mountains to climb, the descent from which only a few make. Left alone, chances are extremely high that the cancer would return. Near term, Henry will likely face the loss of a significant enough portion of his hearing that he will require a hearing aid. One of the drugs used has already shown Henry's susceptibility to it and we will need to use a much higher dose to have the best chance at eradicating his cancer, but only for one cycle as its planned now. Whereas in the first three cycles, his system had its nadir for approximately 4 days, during this treatment, his system will be compromised for much longer during which he'll stay in the hospital as the risk of leaving is too high. We cannot hope for a better reading that that of late, the best result for Henry's type the transplant doctor said he's seen. I'm sure it won't be without its obstacles - some of which we've already climbed or skated past. Neither seemed too pleased to meet one another as the wind was howling and there was no predicting which would have the better of the day. It turned out to be sufficient for much of the time to hang out in the provided housing. Being removed from our home environment for a while, without all the usual distractions seemed welcome by everyone. We ended up forced to look at each other with little to do and we enjoyed it! The first night we were once again treated by the kindness of strangers. Some with toys, money for gas, and others with messages of hope. As much practice at accepting these as I think I've had, it's always a surprise and I never really know what to say, beside the obvious 'Thank You'. I feel forever inadequate trying to convey our gratitude. When going to dinner at 'La Hacienda' that first evening we were treated so well and they made a point of wishing us the best. I'm forever amazed at the sources of our community of support. In the meantime we've been able to hide from it for a couple of days and are preparing to face it together. I didn't really know what to think of it at first, but as with all things, I came to find out that the people doing this really had their hearts in it and once I saw some of the sample photos, I realized what a valuable gift this would be. He ate up all the attention they were giving him. There were clowns there to entertain those waiting and to draw smiles out of the children being photographed. Henry really pushed the clowns to their limits, \"Daddy, ask the clowns if they have any more cricks\". Apparently the drug can continue to affect hearing for up to 180 days after the treatment. The dosing to come is what is worrisome, but we'll deal with that as it comes. We keep reminding ourselves that Henry's type of medulloblastoma is anaplastic, a very aggressive subtype. All that it takes is one cancer cell to persist and we'll have major setbacks. Talk about a needle in a haystack. We arrived at the clinic before the receptionist and early enough that we got to feed the fish. Fortunately the anesthesiologist, whom we've had - and liked - before, offered to give his sedative in his stroller through his tubes of course. He awoke from these after about half an hour of rest and was very pleasant and didn't complain of any pain the rest of the day. After not eating all morning, Henry made up for it the rest of the day with pizza, chicken and gummy worms. A couple weekends ago, we had a relaxing, laze around the house kind of day, where despite all being cooped up inside we were laid back and didn't get on each others nerves. We attempted to interrupt the downward spiral with a trip to DC and the Air and Space Museum, but that was useful mostly for occupying the majority of the day and moving our family togetherness beyond the confines of the house. In the afternoon we took a trip up to Mechanicsburg to spend some time with close friends and their twin girls, who are roughly Sophie's age. Tara said to me as she was talking to the oncologist on our trip home from Baltimore for Henry's MRI. The relief was palpable. The day itself was not so stressful, in fact Henry was a trooper - hardly complaining about not being able to eat all morning - but the weeks and months leading up to this moment, knowing it was coming, afraid for the results, yet hopeful, but wary...We'd prepared for lukewarm news. Other conclusions washed over me as we continued the drive home. Sheaves of worry lifted from my shoulders as I considered it all. We were braced for harsh reality and got handed another chance. là, dis-moi, qu'on s'est battu?On ne s'est pas battu, l'on a tué.- La mine Prospérait.- Quel était son produit ? - La famine.Oui, je sais, le mineur vit sous terre, et n'a rien.Avec la nuit de plus, il est galérien.- Mais toi, faisais-tu donc ce travail, jeune fille ? - Avec tout mon village et toute ma famille,Oui.

Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. We should not harbor ANY bitterness in our hearts toward others. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days.

I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. \". from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I carry it with me everywhere. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. It looks good on the outside, but it has no true function. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. I have pondered this often. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How often is my motive the love of God and the love of neighbour and how often is it something else? How often is it to be well-thought of, or to be thought of as a \"good person\"? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Regardless of our method of transportation, we each have one thing in common: we have a destination. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Even if you plan to enjoy the journey, as we do with the train ride, the main point is to get somewhere. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It will be too late when the train pulls into the station, or when the plane lands on the tarmac to change your mind. It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. The Lord our God is and has been eternal, He has always been and will always be exactly what He is and He will never do anything which contradicts His nature and character. We can have faith that our Lord will always be for us in every situation exactly what we need Him to be, that He will always be working out His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus in our lives and that He is always for us. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have watched as mother, and father, cry and joy over their new child. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It was only halfway through the class before he realized she was going to be ok that he finally relaxed. During the Olympics we saw glimpses of love when a winning athlete would run into the arms of a mother or father for a long and tearful embrace. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). We live in a sub-tropical location, and our city is the only seaport in our state. The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. A 2007 study determined that Mobile is the wettest city in the contiguous 48 states, with 66.3 inches of average annual rainfall over a 30-year period. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). Let us avail ourselves of the promises that have been set before us, to give us hope and comfort regarding those things yet to be. As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. I guess it was inevitable with a nickname of \"Frannie\" that when I became a grandmother I would be called \"Grannie Frannie.\" .\" I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact. slowly he knew he had plenty of time to go back and get it. I had been called into work on my day off, had just gotten off and was tired. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. But I answered her questions: Did I just leave work? Was I a nurse? Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. She had been a positive influence, encouraging me in my walk with the Lord. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. Let us not lose the opportunities that abound around us. South Alabama was playing Nicholls State from Thibodaux, Louisiana and one of their players was injured. We waited as the trainers attended him but when the cart wheeled onto the field we realized it might be more serious that just a pulled muscle or a cramp. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. They motioned for the Nicholls State players on the field to join them and together the two teams prayed for the wounded player. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. On the day when 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in America, 1609 people lost a spouse or partner. More than 3,051 children lost parents. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. As the mother of a police officer, and as a nurse, I understand that sense of duty. The life of service does not stop because one has clocked out. Many who did so never returned. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. In fact, He will be for us \"abundantly above all that we ask or think.\" We can trust Him because He IS good. Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" I remember at the end of my pregnancy with our youngest daughter Emmie, I was working full time at a busy University Center Labor & Delivery. There was little sleep. The first night, someone came in my room for some reason or other at least every hour during the night. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. If that be the case, what have we to fear, of what cause is there to worry? Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Then he asked her about me, \"Is she a charge nurse or something?\" Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\". The Lord Jesus Christ is the express image of God...He is the earthly expression of God the Father and God the Spirit. His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He fed them. Basically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. \"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19). We don't have to be concerned with the fruit produced in our lives. If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing. I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. A few weeks before I was to leave home I decided I just didn't want to go. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\" Now, I had never wanted to be a nurse, had never planned to be a nurse, had never prepared to be a nurse. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I had not taken Chemistry in high school and I would need it to get into nurses' training. I couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. I couldn't take it in night school either. My only choice was to take it in college. Ouch! I took Chemistry in the accelerated session between the Spring and Summer semester. At least I had a friend in my instructor. When he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry. The next fall I started the nursing program and graduated without any problems, even though falling in love during that time presented a huge distraction. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. To this day I can still remember my answer, \"Why would anyone want to work in Labor & Delivery?\" God has a sense of humor, doesn't He? I worked in the Cardiac department of that hospital for three months by the calendar and three years by how it felt to me. During that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors. I have now worked in Labor & Delivery for twenty-nine years. It has been the most incredible blessing to witness the miracle of birth over and over again -- and each time it is indeed a miracle. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. I now qualify for the senior coffee at McDonald's with a free refill, too! That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. And thus he travayled seven yere In many a land bothe farre and nere, Tyll on a day he thought hym tho Unto the sepulture for to go. Having done all this he returns to Hungary. Here the princess, still lamenting her supposedly dead lover, has decided to retire from the world: \"And, squyer, for the love of thee, Fy on this worldes vanyté! Farewell golde pure and fyne; Farewell velvet and satyne; Farewell castelles and maners also; Farewell huntynge and hawkynge to; Farewell revell, \n\nIt looks like we have a few more rough days ahead of us. Amphotericin is an anti-fungal medicine, of which I remember nothing from medical school except it's nickname, ampho-terrible, named due to it's uncomfortable side effects. We haven't yet heard about the results of the studies. Tho he does not seem bothered by the rash, it's fairly impressive looking, and I can't imagine what would have happened to his skin without all that bathing. I have mixed feelings about listing all of this information. But I feel a profound need to give voice to Henry's struggle, and Bryan and I are the filters through which that happens. Since Henry can't speak for himself, we need to help him tell his story. It's a story of courage, resilience, love, and strength, but it's unfortunately also a story of pain, fear, and loss. The rattling in his chest gave way to coughing and he began spitting blood. Usually Henry has a single complaint but today he said that most everything hurt which prompted me to request that his morphine be increased. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with all of these things. They always send something for the walls. The videos were not the only thing that came to cheer Henry. He received some huge balloons, one of which sang the song, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\". Henry is now on a morphine drip to help ease some of the discomfort he is experiencing. He also has control of a bolus of morphine to help any more acute pain. We were told to expect a fever, but had skated by without one up to now. Since we're not allowed to come home with Henry after this round of chemotherapy, arrangements have been made for us to stay at the St. Casimir House, another Believe in Tomorrow residence. Instead of telling Henry that we cannot come home, we're telling him that we get to go on vacation to this house, his images of which are likely those of their House by the Sea, a retreat house we recently stayed at in Ocean City. After we told him of this, he's now generally more fixed on going there than home, so it's been a good strategy. Things are going much better than any of us expected. It amazes me how much abuse his little body can take, and keep on moving and lovin' life!! He's liberated in every sense of the word. He and Sophie immediately started playing, and within minutes they were running around the room screaming and jumping as a remote control Tow-mater chased them. Henry then cut off various limbs of his family members, and finally decided to use the chainsaw to give some My Little Ponies a hair cut. It's a little hard for him after his sisters go home, but he really had a ball. He rode the bike out in the hallway and accompanied me to do laundry and down to get my lunch. We are allowed this freedom as he was unhooked at our request for a brief period of time today. As long as he's bathed and changed before we adventure out (and refrain from touching things) we can go where we please for now, despite our 'isolation'. I was able to distract him and he accepted it for now. He had some down time in the afternoon and then engaged his nurse with some play about his workbench. She indulged him very enthusiastically. A big relief from what was expected. Today is considered Day Zero, or the day he gets his stem cells, that were harvested from him 3 months ago, put back into his body. On the one hand, everyone tells us that it’s just like hanging another bag of medication, which runs in uneventfully. So now we wait for that to happen over the next two weeks. He woke happily and has spent all day in bed. They had done a stool culture and found something called VRE. To prevent passing it on to others however, he must now be put in ‘isolation’. Sometime during the first game, a child about Henry's age won and picked that train. Each time, she would say something like 'pass the phone' and Henry thought it was his newly chosen prize being taken again. They called 'G - Bottle' and that did it for us. He was very proud of his prize and showed all the nurses that came in and promised to call them on it. After all, this is his life and his struggle. He's being forged into such a champion each day. I fell very easily into the rhythm of our new home life and had put behind me the first phase of chemotherapy as difficult but over. This reflection was tossed among the daily rituals that have become normalized in our new view of reality. I felt like I'd come to a calm acceptance of day to day living within our new situation and withheld looking too far into the future for fear of becoming too attached to a positive outcome or too overwhelmed by a negative one. The several days immediately preceding Henry's most recent admission, began to weigh heavier and heavier upon me, a sense of dread mounting with each out patient visit to have him tested for his current functions so we could recognize what the chemotherapy had done to him. At some point during this time, I began to see the chemotherapy, not as medicine, but poison. We were planning to poison my son, because nothing else had any chance of preserving his life. The effects of this poison were to leave him, and those around him for that matter, scarred for life. Hopefully these scars would be minimal - small crosses to bear, the likes of which affect some at random anyhow - infertility or hearing loss for example. This knowledge and the pause before commencing the treatment, left me to stew on the possible outcomes, no longer able to preserve my shelter of ignorance. For the first time since Henry's diagnosis, I found myself angry at this situation. It wasn't a 'why us' kind of anger, but a frustrated, having-been-backed-into-a-corner kind of anger. There was nothing to do but accept it. No pleasure to be taken that would alleviate it. With full knowledge of it's effects, we would administer this poison to our son, hoping that it killed it's target before it ravaged him. I withdrew into myself, not really understanding my feelings well enough to talk about them to anyone. I exercised, meditated, ate better food, tried to relax; all attempts to calm myself about it. Nothing would change what was about to happen. It wasn't until I had my first turn in the hospital with him, seeing him doing well - laughing, playing and entertaining - that I was able to better accept our path. I woke up to a new level of realization and with it, a new wave of grief. Momentarily lifting my head out of my anxiety for our future, I found the effects of Henry's diagnosis rippling out to so many people, some very close and some at a distance. I realized that I've not been as attentive to those immediately around me - my daughters, what is this doing to them? I picture their sweet faces looking up at me with a sad, innocent and inquiring look, eyes welled with tears. I look at my wife and imagine us on our wedding day, never guessing what could lie ahead, wishing to avoid things like this. I see our parents being supportive but looking behind their eyes - I see their empathy for us and their own plight of having a grandchild with cancer, wanting so desperately to help or fix things and not being able to; our relatives, watching and being supportive where possible, going about their normal days only to be reminded suddenly of what's going on at odd moments throughout the day; circles of friends feeling helpless but offering such wonderful support despite it all; parents of our children's friends trying to give answers to their kids - knowing that no kid should have to worry about such things; barely beginning to appreciate the years and years of treatments those families we see in the clinic have endured and are to yet endure; watching kids during chemotherapy and seeing them colorful and playful one minute and ashen and sickly the next. Other days I feel capable, but wary because I know it's simply a function of time before that changes. In lieu of describing this whirlwind of emotions, my answers are brief and guarded when others ask how we're doing. When people marvel at how we're 'doing it all', I have to think, 'if you only knew'. Yes, there are opportunities for growth in all of this. Adversity does that. But it's difficult to take solace in that. It's a difficult pill to swallow that one's growth is coming at such an expense. But what are we to do? In the face of such a crisis, we pick ourselves up, arming ourselves with the comfort and support of family and friends and make the effort to take one step, one day, one moment at a time. He was, unbelievably, quite eager to come. Due to the immune suppression that he'll have, there are some nursing (and therefore parenting) issues that will be new to us this time. The degree of discomfort varies from patient to patient. It sounds like he handled the first three cycles better than a lot of kids do, so we're hopeful we'll continue to have the same luck. It's what they told us to expect, but with the insurance as the critical dependency, I was kind of hoping for one more weekend. I have this strange conflicting irritation with the kids' minute-by-minute demands whenever we are expecting the hospital. I get frustrated with myself for it, because I feel I should be more patient and appreciative of them at such a time. Having a child with cancer alters your dreams. It changes your perceptions of the world, the people you interact with and the long-held beliefs about everything from what one should expect from everyday life to the metaphysical questions of why we're here. Today we were given a glimpse of the road ahead and there are significant mountains to climb, the descent from which only a few make. Left alone, chances are extremely high that the cancer would return. Near term, Henry will likely face the loss of a significant enough portion of his hearing that he will require a hearing aid. One of the drugs used has already shown Henry's susceptibility to it and we will need to use a much higher dose to have the best chance at eradicating his cancer, but only for one cycle as its planned now. Whereas in the first three cycles, his system had its nadir for approximately 4 days, during this treatment, his system will be compromised for much longer during which he'll stay in the hospital as the risk of leaving is too high. We cannot hope for a better reading that that of late, the best result for Henry's type the transplant doctor said he's seen. I'm sure it won't be without its obstacles - some of which we've already climbed or skated past. Neither seemed too pleased to meet one another as the wind was howling and there was no predicting which would have the better of the day. It turned out to be sufficient for much of the time to hang out in the provided housing. Being removed from our home environment for a while, without all the usual distractions seemed welcome by everyone. We ended up forced to look at each other with little to do and we enjoyed it! The first night we were once again treated by the kindness of strangers. Some with toys, money for gas, and others with messages of hope. As much practice at accepting these as I think I've had, it's always a surprise and I never really know what to say, beside the obvious 'Thank You'. I feel forever inadequate trying to convey our gratitude. When going to dinner at 'La Hacienda' that first evening we were treated so well and they made a point of wishing us the best. I'm forever amazed at the sources of our community of support. In the meantime we've been able to hide from it for a couple of days and are preparing to face it together. I didn't really know what to think of it at first, but as with all things, I came to find out that the people doing this really had their hearts in it and once I saw some of the sample photos, I realized what a valuable gift this would be. He ate up all the attention they were giving him. There were clowns there to entertain those waiting and to draw smiles out of the children being photographed. Henry really pushed the clowns to their limits, \"Daddy, ask the clowns if they have any more cricks\". Apparently the drug can continue to affect hearing for up to 180 days after the treatment. The dosing to come is what is worrisome, but we'll deal with that as it comes. We keep reminding ourselves that Henry's type of medulloblastoma is anaplastic, a very aggressive subtype. All that it takes is one cancer cell to persist and we'll have major setbacks. Talk about a needle in a haystack. We arrived at the clinic before the receptionist and early enough that we got to feed the fish. Fortunately the anesthesiologist, whom we've had - and liked - before, offered to give his sedative in his stroller through his tubes of course. He awoke from these after about half an hour of rest and was very pleasant and didn't complain of any pain the rest of the day. After not eating all morning, Henry made up for it the rest of the day with pizza, chicken and gummy worms. A couple weekends ago, we had a relaxing, laze around the house kind of day, where despite all being cooped up inside we were laid back and didn't get on each others nerves. We attempted to interrupt the downward spiral with a trip to DC and the Air and Space Museum, but that was useful mostly for occupying the majority of the day and moving our family togetherness beyond the confines of the house. In the afternoon we took a trip up to Mechanicsburg to spend some time with close friends and their twin girls, who are roughly Sophie's age. Tara said to me as she was talking to the oncologist on our trip home from Baltimore for Henry's MRI. The relief was palpable. The day itself was not so stressful, in fact Henry was a trooper - hardly complaining about not being able to eat all morning - but the weeks and months leading up to this moment, knowing it was coming, afraid for the results, yet hopeful, but wary...We'd prepared for lukewarm news. Other conclusions washed over me as we continued the drive home. Sheaves of worry lifted from my shoulders as I considered it all. We were braced for harsh reality and got handed another chance. là, dis-moi, qu'on s'est battu?On ne s'est pas battu, l'on a tué.- La mine Prospérait.- Quel était son produit ? - La famine.Oui, je sais, le mineur vit sous terre, et n'a rien.Avec la nuit de plus, il est galérien.- Mais toi, faisais-tu donc ce travail, jeune fille ? - Avec tout mon village et toute ma famille,Oui.
