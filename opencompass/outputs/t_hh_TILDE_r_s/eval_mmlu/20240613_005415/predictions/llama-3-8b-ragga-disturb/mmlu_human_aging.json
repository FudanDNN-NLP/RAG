It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός iatros meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology. Scope\n\nDifferences between adult and geriatric medicine \nGeriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person. Geriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging. For example, renal impairment may be a part of aging, but kidney failure and urinary incontinence are not. Geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging. Geriatricians focus on achieving the patient's highest priorities in the context of multiple chronic conditions, and on preserving function. Increased complexity\nThe decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Geriatric giants \nThe so-called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people, especially as they begin to fail. Practical concerns\nFunctional abilities, independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refers people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate. Frail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Subspecialties and related services \n\nSome diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults, e.g., dementia, delirium, falls. As societies aged, many specialized geriatric- and geriatrics-related services emerged including:\n\nMedical \n Geriatric cardiology or cardiogeriatrics \n Geriatric dentistry\n Geriatric dermatology \n Geriatric diagnostic imaging\n Geriatric emergency medicine\n Geriatric nephrology \n Geriatric neurology \n Geriatric oncology \n Geriatric physical examination of interest especially to physicians & physician assistants. Geriatric psychiatry or psychogeriatrics (focus on dementia, delirium, depression and other psychiatric disorders)\n Geriatric public health or preventive geriatrics \n Geriatric rehabilitation \n Geriatric rheumatology (focus on joints and soft tissue disorders in elderly)\n Geriatric sexology (focus on sexuality in aged people)\n Geriatric subspeciality medical clinics (such as geriatric anticoagulation clinic, geriatric assessment clinic, falls and balance clinic, continence clinic, palliative care clinic, elderly pain clinic, cognition and memory disorders clinic)\n\nSurgical \n Geriatric orthopaedics or orthogeriatrics (close cooperation with orthopedic surgery and a focus on osteoporosis and rehabilitation). Geriatric cardiothoracic surgery\n Geriatric urology\n Geriatric otolaryngology\n Geriatric general surgery\n Geriatric trauma\n Geriatric gynecology\n Geriatric ophthalmology\n\nOther geriatrics subspecialties \n Geriatric anesthesia (focuses on anesthesia & perioperative care of elderly)\n Geriatric intensive-care unit: (a special type of intensive care unit dedicated to critically ill elderly)\n Geriatric nursing (focuses on nursing of elderly patients and the aged). Geriatric nutrition\n Geriatric occupational therapy\n Geriatric pain management\n Geriatric pharmacy\n Geriatric optometry\n Geriatric physical therapy\n Geriatric podiatry\n Geriatric psychology\n Geriatric speech-language pathology (focuses on neurological disorders such as dysphagia, stroke, aphasia, and traumatic brain injury)\n Geriatric mental health counselor/specialist (focuses on treatment more so than assessment)\n Geriatric audiology\n\nHistory\n\nOne of the eight branches of the traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, is jara or rasayana, similar to geriatrics. The term geriatrics was proposed in 1908 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, Laurate of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and later by 1909 by Dr. Ignatz Leo Nascher, former Chief of Clinic in the Mount Sinai Hospital Outpatient Department (New York City) and a \"father\" of geriatrics in the United States. Using her experiences as a physician in a London Workhouse infirmary, she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough; they needed diagnosis, treatment, care, and support. It values all the professions, not just medicine, for their contributions in optimizing the well-being and independence of older people. Another innovator of British geriatrics is Bernard Isaacs, who described the \"giants\" of geriatrics mentioned above: immobility and instability, incontinence, and impaired intellect. Geriatrician training\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, geriatricians are primary-care physicians (D.O. who are board-certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatric medicine. Geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process, the impact of aging on illness patterns, drug therapy in seniors, health maintenance, and rehabilitation. They are frequently involved in ethics consultations to represent the unique health and diseases patterns seen in seniors. The model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on working closely with other disciplines such as nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and social workers. United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, most geriatricians are hospital physicians, whereas others focus on community geriatrics in particular. Although originally a distinct clinical specialty, it has been integrated as a specialization of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most geriatricians are, therefore, accredited for both. Unlike in the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom and are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists. can complete a three-year core internal medicine residency program, followed by two years of specialized geriatrics residency training. Doctors of Medicine can opt for a two-year residency program in family medicine and complete a one-year enhanced skills program in care of the elderly. Many universities across Canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public, such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents. India\nIn India, Geriatrics is a relatively new speciality offering. Unfortunately, only eight major institutes provide M.D in Geriatric Medicine and subsequent training. Training in some institutes are exclusive in the Department of Geriatric Medicine, with rotations in Internal medicine, medical subspecialties etc. but in certain institutions, are limited to 2-year training in Internal medicine and subspecialities followed by one year of exclusive training in Geriatric Medicine. Minimum geriatric competencies\nIn July 2007, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the John A. Hartford Foundation hosted a National Consensus Conference on Competencies in Geriatric Education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies (learning outcomes) that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients. Twenty-six (26) Minimum Geriatric Competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP). The domains are: cognitive and behavioral disorders; medication management; self-care capacity; falls, balance, gait disorders; atypical presentation of disease; palliative care; hospital care for elders, and health care planning and promotion. Research\n\nHospital Elder Life Program\nA prominent clinical challenge in geriatric medicine is the treatment and prevention of delirium. To that end, HELP promotes interventions designed to maintain cognitive and physical functioning of older adults throughout the hospitalization, maximize patients' independence at discharge, assist with the transition from hospital to home and prevent unplanned hospital readmissions. Customized interventions include daily visitors; therapeutic activities to provide mental stimulation; daily exercise and walking assistance; sleep enhancement; nutritional support and hearing and vision protocols. Ethical and medico-legal issues \nElderly persons sometimes cannot make decisions for themselves. Geriatricians must respect the patients' privacy while seeing that they receive appropriate and necessary services. Adequate training, services, and support can reduce the likelihood of elder abuse, and proper attention can often identify it.

Geriatrics: Geriatrics is a medical specialty that focuses on the healthcare needs of older adults. Geriatricians are physicians who have specialized postgraduate education and experience in the medical care of older persons. They are trained to address the unique physiological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. Geriatric Nursing: Geriatric nursing is a specialization within nursing that focuses on providing comprehensive healthcare to elderly adults. Geriatric Nurse Practitioners (GNPs) are registered nurses who have pursued additional education through a master's degree program in nursing. They are trained to deliver primary healthcare to older adults and often work in various settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers. Geriatric Psychiatry: Geriatric psychiatry involves the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders in older adults. Geriatric psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in the mental health care of older adults. They are trained to address conditions such as dementia, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders that commonly affect the elderly population. Geriatric Pharmacy: Geriatric pharmacy focuses on the medication management and optimization for older adults. Pharmacists specializing in geriatrics are trained to understand the unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in older adults, as well as potential drug interactions and adverse effects that may disproportionately affect this population. Geriatric Rehabilitation: Geriatric rehabilitation aims to improve the physical and functional abilities of older adults who may have experienced age-related decline or have specific conditions such as stroke, arthritis, or hip fracture. This specialty involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and social workers, who work together to develop individualized treatment plans to enhance the quality of life and independence of older adults. These are just a few examples of medical specialties and educational programs that focus on the care of older adults. Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults.

Using her experiences as a physician in a London Workhouse infirmary, she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough; they needed diagnosis, treatment, care, and support. It values all the professions, not just medicine, for their contributions in optimizing the well-being and independence of older people. Another innovator of British geriatrics is Bernard Isaacs, who described the \"giants\" of geriatrics mentioned above: immobility and instability, incontinence, and impaired intellect. Geriatrician training\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, geriatricians are primary-care physicians (D.O. who are board-certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatric medicine. Geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process, the impact of aging on illness patterns, drug therapy in seniors, health maintenance, and rehabilitation. They are frequently involved in ethics consultations to represent the unique health and diseases patterns seen in seniors. The model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on working closely with other disciplines such as nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and social workers. United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, most geriatricians are hospital physicians, whereas others focus on community geriatrics in particular. Although originally a distinct clinical specialty, it has been integrated as a specialization of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most geriatricians are, therefore, accredited for both. Unlike in the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom and are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists. Canada\nIn Canada, there are two pathways that can be followed in order to work as a physician in a geriatric setting. can complete a three-year core internal medicine residency program, followed by two years of specialized geriatrics residency training. Doctors of Medicine can opt for a two-year residency program in family medicine and complete a one-year enhanced skills program in care of the elderly. Many universities across Canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public, such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents. India\nIn India, Geriatrics is a relatively new speciality offering. Unfortunately, only eight major institutes provide M.D in Geriatric Medicine and subsequent training. Training in some institutes are exclusive in the Department of Geriatric Medicine, with rotations in Internal medicine, medical subspecialties etc. but in certain institutions, are limited to 2-year training in Internal medicine and subspecialities followed by one year of exclusive training in Geriatric Medicine. Minimum geriatric competencies\nIn July 2007, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the John A. Hartford Foundation hosted a National Consensus Conference on Competencies in Geriatric Education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies (learning outcomes) that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients. Twenty-six (26) Minimum Geriatric Competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP). The domains are: cognitive and behavioral disorders; medication management; self-care capacity; falls, balance, gait disorders; atypical presentation of disease; palliative care; hospital care for elders, and health care planning and promotion. Research\n\nHospital Elder Life Program\nA prominent clinical challenge in geriatric medicine is the treatment and prevention of delirium. To that end, HELP promotes interventions designed to maintain cognitive and physical functioning of older adults throughout the hospitalization, maximize patients' independence at discharge, assist with the transition from hospital to home and prevent unplanned hospital readmissions. Customized interventions include daily visitors; therapeutic activities to provide mental stimulation; daily exercise and walking assistance; sleep enhancement; nutritional support and hearing and vision protocols. Ethical and medico-legal issues \nElderly persons sometimes cannot make decisions for themselves. Geriatricians must respect the patients' privacy while seeing that they receive appropriate and necessary services. Adequate training, services, and support can reduce the likelihood of elder abuse, and proper attention can often identify it.

        "context": "Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός iatros meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology. Scope\n\nDifferences between adult and geriatric medicine \nGeriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person. Geriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging. For example, renal impairment may be a part of aging, but kidney failure and urinary incontinence are not. Geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging. Geriatricians focus on achieving the patient's highest priorities in the context of multiple chronic conditions, and on preserving function. Increased complexity\nThe decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Geriatric giants \nThe so-called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people, especially as they begin to fail. Practical concerns\nFunctional abilities, independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refers people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate. Frail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes.

Geriatrics: Geriatrics is a medical specialty that focuses on the healthcare needs of older adults. Geriatricians are physicians who have specialized postgraduate education and experience in the medical care of older persons. They are trained to address the unique physiological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. Geriatric Nursing: Geriatric nursing is a specialization within nursing that focuses on providing comprehensive healthcare to elderly adults. Geriatric Nurse Practitioners (GNPs) are registered nurses who have pursued additional education through a master's degree program in nursing. They are trained to deliver primary healthcare to older adults and often work in various settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers. Geriatric Psychiatry: Geriatric psychiatry involves the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders in older adults. Geriatric psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in the mental health care of older adults. They are trained to address conditions such as dementia, depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders that commonly affect the elderly population. Geriatric Pharmacy: Geriatric pharmacy focuses on the medication management and optimization for older adults. Pharmacists specializing in geriatrics are trained to understand the unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in older adults, as well as potential drug interactions and adverse effects that may disproportionately affect this population. Geriatric Rehabilitation: Geriatric rehabilitation aims to improve the physical and functional abilities of older adults who may have experienced age-related decline or have specific conditions such as stroke, arthritis, or hip fracture. This specialty involves a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and social workers, who work together to develop individualized treatment plans to enhance the quality of life and independence of older adults. These are just a few examples of medical specialties and educational programs that focus on the care of older adults. Geriatrics, or geriatric medicine, is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults.

The model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on working closely with other disciplines such as nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and social workers. United Kingdom\nIn the United Kingdom, most geriatricians are hospital physicians, whereas others focus on community geriatrics in particular. Although originally a distinct clinical specialty, it has been integrated as a specialization of general medicine since the late 1970s. Most geriatricians are, therefore, accredited for both. Unlike in the United States, geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the United Kingdom and are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists. Canada\nIn Canada, there are two pathways that can be followed in order to work as a physician in a geriatric setting. can complete a three-year core internal medicine residency program, followed by two years of specialized geriatrics residency training. Doctors of Medicine can opt for a two-year residency program in family medicine and complete a one-year enhanced skills program in care of the elderly. Many universities across Canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public, such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents. India\nIn India, Geriatrics is a relatively new speciality offering. Unfortunately, only eight major institutes provide M.D in Geriatric Medicine and subsequent training. Training in some institutes are exclusive in the Department of Geriatric Medicine, with rotations in Internal medicine, medical subspecialties etc. but in certain institutions, are limited to 2-year training in Internal medicine and subspecialities followed by one year of exclusive training in Geriatric Medicine. Minimum geriatric competencies\nIn July 2007, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the John A. Hartford Foundation hosted a National Consensus Conference on Competencies in Geriatric Education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies (learning outcomes) that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients. Twenty-six (26) Minimum Geriatric Competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs (ADGAP). The domains are: cognitive and behavioral disorders; medication management; self-care capacity; falls, balance, gait disorders; atypical presentation of disease; palliative care; hospital care for elders, and health care planning and promotion.

It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician, or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning \"old man\", and ιατρός iatros meaning \"healer\". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology. Scope\n\nDifferences between adult and geriatric medicine \nGeriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person. Geriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging. For example, renal impairment may be a part of aging, but kidney failure and urinary incontinence are not. Geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging. Geriatricians focus on achieving the patient's highest priorities in the context of multiple chronic conditions, and on preserving function. Increased complexity\nThe decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems (such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis). Geriatric giants \nThe so-called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people, especially as they begin to fail. Practical concerns\nFunctional abilities, independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients. A geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options, and refers people to home care services, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospice as appropriate. Frail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care, because the risk-benefit ratio is different. For example, frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms, because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain, impairment, or loss of life before they would die of other causes. Assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Subspecialties and related services \n\nSome diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults, e.g., dementia, delirium, falls. As societies aged, many specialized geriatric- and geriatrics-related services emerged including:\n\nMedical \n Geriatric cardiology or cardiogeriatrics \n Geriatric dentistry\n Geriatric dermatology \n Geriatric diagnostic imaging\n Geriatric emergency medicine\n Geriatric nephrology \n Geriatric neurology \n Geriatric oncology \n Geriatric physical examination of interest especially to physicians & physician assistants. Geriatric psychiatry or psychogeriatrics (focus on dementia, delirium, depression and other psychiatric disorders)\n Geriatric public health or preventive geriatrics \n Geriatric rehabilitation \n Geriatric rheumatology (focus on joints and soft tissue disorders in elderly)\n Geriatric sexology (focus on sexuality in aged people)\n Geriatric subspeciality medical clinics (such as geriatric anticoagulation clinic, geriatric assessment clinic, falls and balance clinic, continence clinic, palliative care clinic, elderly pain clinic, cognition and memory disorders clinic)\n\nSurgical \n Geriatric orthopaedics or orthogeriatrics (close cooperation with orthopedic surgery and a focus on osteoporosis and rehabilitation). Geriatric cardiothoracic surgery\n Geriatric urology\n Geriatric otolaryngology\n Geriatric general surgery\n Geriatric trauma\n Geriatric gynecology\n Geriatric ophthalmology\n\nOther geriatrics subspecialties \n Geriatric anesthesia (focuses on anesthesia & perioperative care of elderly)\n Geriatric intensive-care unit: (a special type of intensive care unit dedicated to critically ill elderly)\n Geriatric nursing (focuses on nursing of elderly patients and the aged). Geriatric nutrition\n Geriatric occupational therapy\n Geriatric pain management\n Geriatric pharmacy\n Geriatric optometry\n Geriatric physical therapy\n Geriatric podiatry\n Geriatric psychology\n Geriatric speech-language pathology (focuses on neurological disorders such as dysphagia, stroke, aphasia, and traumatic brain injury)\n Geriatric mental health counselor/specialist (focuses on treatment more so than assessment)\n Geriatric audiology\n\nHistory\n\nOne of the eight branches of the traditional Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, is jara or rasayana, similar to geriatrics. The term geriatrics was proposed in 1908 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, Laurate of the Nobel Prize for Medicine and later by 1909 by Dr. Ignatz Leo Nascher, former Chief of Clinic in the Mount Sinai Hospital Outpatient Department (New York City) and a \"father\" of geriatrics in the United States. Using her experiences as a physician in a London Workhouse infirmary, she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough; they needed diagnosis, treatment, care, and support. It values all the professions, not just medicine, for their contributions in optimizing the well-being and independence of older people. Another innovator of British geriatrics is Bernard Isaacs, who described the \"giants\" of geriatrics mentioned above: immobility and instability, incontinence, and impaired intellect. Geriatrician training\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, geriatricians are primary-care physicians (D.O. who are board-certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatric medicine. Geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process, the impact of aging on illness patterns, drug therapy in seniors, health maintenance, and rehabilitation.

One theory that explains the trade-offs and variations in life history traits in different organisms is the life history theory. This theory suggests that evolution is influenced by the allocation of limited resources to various aspects of life, including development, sexual maturation, reproduction, number of offspring, and senescence and death. As a result, trade-offs occur between these phases of life. Another theory is the disposable soma theory of aging, proposed by Kirkwood and Holliday in 1979. This theory combines several ideas and suggests that an organism has finite resources to allocate between reproduction and maintenance of its body (\"soma\"). The theory argues that resources invested in reproduction reduce the resources available for maintaining the body, resulting in senescence and eventual death. The programmed death theory, proposed by Weissman in 1882, suggests that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to free up environmental resources for younger members of the species after reproduction is completed. For example, genes for sex hormones may be necessary for reproduction in early life but contribute to the risk of cancer in old age. Overall, these theories provide insights into the trade-offs and variations in life history traits among different organisms and help us understand the evolutionary processes that shape the development, reproduction, senescence, and death in living beings. This theory states that aging and death are programmed and have evolved to remove older animals from the population so that environmental resources such as food and water are freed up for younger members of the species.The first evolutionary theory of aging was proposed by Weissman in 1882.Programmed death.Aging is seen as the random degeneration resulting from the inability of evolution to prevent it, i.e., the nonadaptive consequence of evolutionary “neglect.” This conclusion is supported by studies that restricted reproduction to later life in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, thus permitting natural selection to operate on later life traits and leading to an increase in longevity. Conversely, there are some living things that undergo programmed death immediately after reproduction, such as annual plants and semelparous animals (Fig. Some of the major classical evolutionary theories of aging include the following:\n\nNegligible senescence Rapid death postreproduction (semelparous animals, annual plants) Rougheye rockfish Bristlecone pine Pacific salmon Sunflower\n\nFIGURE 94e-4 The typical features of aging (aging phenotype and exponential increase in risk of death) are not universal findings in liv-ing things.

The theory of aging and death as programmed phenomena in the context of evolution suggests that aging and death have evolved as a mechanism to remove older members of a species from the population. The concept of programmed death proposes that aging is the result of the nonadaptive consequence of evolutionary \"neglect,\" where evolution has been unable to prevent the random degeneration associated with aging. On the other hand, there are living organisms that experience programmed death immediately after reproduction, such as annual plants and semelparous animals.

Loneliness, untreated mental health problems, and chronic pain also put them at risk for developing substance abuse issues. Older adults are more vulnerable to prescription drug misuse, not specifically abuse; they do not adhere to their doctors’ recommendations for safe consumption, which is risky among a population that must manage multiple prescriptions. NCADD found that people who lost a spouse or long-term partner, who were over the age of 75, were the most likely to struggle with alcohol abuse problems. While older adults are at greater risk from problem drinking and prescription drugs, they are less likely than the general population to abuse other illicit substances; they are less likely to begin abusing heroin instead of prescription opioids, cocaine, or other illegal substances. In 2003, according to AARP, about 28 percent of retired adults had ever abused an illicit drug, like marijuana or LSD, but by 2008, that percentage increased to almost 36 percent. Circumstances around retirement, such as having adult children away from home, loss of a spouse or partner, and the death of friends, are unique circumstances among older adults, which can lead to psychological issues that can trigger addiction or substance abuse. they are more likely to need help with daily life from caregivers, which can affect their self-esteem. They may have financial issues due to retirement subsidies, and seeing people close to them pass away are all issues that can cause depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) found that 1.6 percent of older adults had thoughts of suicide in the past year; about 25 percent of older adults struggle with some form of mental health problem. Ageism is a severe problem that older adults face, not just in general culture, but among doctors and nurses in the medical field. Caregivers, family members, and medical professionals are more likely to have different standards for happiness, wellness, and quality of life for younger adults than older adults. This is a false belief, as intoxicating and addictive drugs shorten lifespan for anyone, at any age, and abuse of alcohol and drugs is likely to be a symptom that something is wrong with the person’s mental health, which contributes to a lower quality of life. The problem of ageism also makes it harder to recognize symptoms of mental illness and addiction in older adults. Physical challenges, memory issues, “crabbiness,” and lack of energy are associated with lower general health among older adults, but they are also symptoms of addiction. If an elderly person’s mental and physical health decline rapidly, it could be a sign of substance abuse, or it could be a sign of an underlying chronic condition. This will help to rule out other conditions, like depression, diabetes, or dementia, which could be affecting the senior citizen instead. As substance abuse is better understood as a disease, rehabilitation programs are integrating science-based information to help people with different needs, and this includes the needs of people ages 65 and up. People of different ages and gender tend to differ in many aspects, such as legal and social responsibilities, outlooks on life, and self-perceptions. Older people have different requirements from society and government, and frequently have differing values as well, such as for property and pension rights. Older people are also more likely to vote, and in many countries the young are forbidden from voting. For example, age may be measured starting from conception or from birth, and starting at either age zero or age one. Transitions such as reaching puberty, age of majority, or retirement are often socially significant. The concepts of successful aging and healthy aging refer to both social and physical aspects of the aging process. Psychologists have examined coping skills in the elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an internal locus of control have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with stressful life events in later life. Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. Retirement, a common transition faced by the elderly, may have both positive and negative consequences. Individuals in different wings in the same retirement home have demonstrated a lower risk of mortality and higher alertness and self-rated health in the wing where residents had greater control over their environment, though personal control may have less impact on specific measures of health. Social control, perceptions of how much influence one has over one's social relationships, shows support as a moderator variable for the relationship between social support and perceived health in the elderly and may positively influence coping in the elderly.
