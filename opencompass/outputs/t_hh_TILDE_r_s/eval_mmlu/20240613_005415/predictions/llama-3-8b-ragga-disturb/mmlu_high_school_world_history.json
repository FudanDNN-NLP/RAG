By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nC.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following best explains Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China?\nA.

Returning people to their life is an incredible experience I am privileged to share with my patients and entire team, every day. My central role in developing a program with a theme of excellence in the diagnosis and treatment of heart valve disease allows me to perform approximately 300 cardiac surgeries each year, spanning from transcatheter valve replacement and minimally invasive valve repair, to multi-valve reoperations and adult congenital cardiac surgery. In addition, for the past fifteen years, I have been dedicated to ensuring excellence in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and have trained hundreds of surgeons to address atrial fibrillation for their patients. I have the good fortune to participate in trials and research that have enhanced our ability to achieve these goals. I trained for seven years at Loyola Medical Center in Chicago and remain on staff. I have the luxury and my patients have the benefit, of being part of a process based on excellent communication and collaboration among some of the finest health care professionals working in cardiac care. As a founding member of ERAS Cardiac (Enhanced Recover After Surgery) I have merged many of our program initiatives with other progressive programs around the world, to share practice excellence. In addition to leading edge valve therapies, we have integrated an exceptional set of skills and practices to minimize discomfort and accelerate recover. By combining minimally invasive procedures with advance local nerve block and providing rigid fixation for all patients requiring sternotomy, we have dramatically diminished any early limitations on activity and hastened restoration to a full life. My team and I deliver the care we would want for our own family. In my opinion, he is a very talented surgeon. My motto is a “ton of gain with zero pain.” I would highly recommend Dr. Gerdisch and his team. \"I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Marc Gerdisch. I first met him in 2007 after my 1 and only afib experience. I was sent to talk to him again in early 2018 by my cardiologist Dr. Rao. We met and came to the conclusion that it was time to replace my aortic root which was now 5.0cm and repair my moderate to severe leaking aortic valve. He has a great way of making you feel comfortable. He did successfully repair and save my aortic valve as well as replacing my aortic root too. He has saved my life and I look forward to a long full life to enjoy with my wife and daughter. \"Surgery was actually for my 85 year old father, HAROLD R. DEMERLY. Hospital staff was friendly, we were greeted with smiles and personally escorted to the appropriate area of hospital, after registering. Dr. Gerdisch's staff was kind and made us feel like we have known them all for a long time, even though we were just meeting them. The team work between Dr. Shaikh & his staff and Dr. Gerdisch & his staff made my father and our family feel comfortable that we were where we should be. I bought Adam Pick's book (wow, he went through a lot of issues), fired up the web and talked with many acquaintances that had undergone heart surgery. However, I had plenty of time to research, and I did! Now I know that my choice of Dr. Marc Gerdisch as the surgeon for my severely stenotic aortic valve replacement was the right one. In my case, he was able to perform a minimally-invasive procedure (with a horizontal incision about three inches long) which is resulting in a shorter recovery period (eleven days now since operation, six of them in the hospital). Sure, Gerdisch has a number of \"firsts\" in the field and is, obviously, an intelligent researcher; but he's also a dedicated, hard-working guy! So, do the research necessary for your particular circumstance! But if Dr. Marc Gerdisch comes into your browser, give him a serious look. I feel that you will be glad you did!\" I had an ascending aortic aneurysm that needed repaired and needed an aortic mechanical onyx valve placed. He is so articulate, smart, professional and caring! You could not go wrong by picking Dr Gerdisch! I would reccomend him to anyone! I am truly blessed to have known to go to Dr Gerdisch! He is one in a million! \"I was diagnosed with aortic stenosis. Dr. Gerdisch took the time to explain to me everything that was going on and what he would be doing. He encouraged me to ask any questions that I might have. He even explained to me that my children had a chance of having the same defect. My daughter was with me and he took the time to listen to her heart and order a test for her. \"This was a very informed and good experience. His assistant, Tara was always very helpful giving me the confidence that my progress was on tract. I was able to use my arms right away, and I feel it reduced my recovery time by at least 2 weeks. \"Dr Gerdisch is Awesome and I owe him my life!!! Once I met him, I knew I was in great hands. I am a complicated case as I am told, I am dialysis patient, prior open heart - 7 bypass, double leg amputee, vascular disease, Gillian barre and cancer survivor with many drug allergies. Dr Gerdisch stated that he did something that he has not performed before. He did not want to open up my sternum because I need my arms to transfer since I am an amputee. The recovery time would be too long and rigorous. I would recommend him.\" \"Dr. Marc Gerdisch and associates provided top-notch care for my mother throughout the whole process. I did not want the open heart surgery if possible, but that was the only option in my mother's immediate area. I searched for a highly respected doctor within my mother's network who wasn't too far away. They not only do the job medically, but they really care for their patients as not just patients, but family whom they are helping get back on their feet!\" \"I could tell he was A-1......have been told not every surgeon could have fixed me. But I healed up fast and was able to use my arms right away. Unfortunately, I had Seratonin Syndrome, and it has affected much more than the surgery. The doctors at St Francis are wonderful.....but Dr. Gerdish is top level.\" \"I was diagnosed with an ascending aortic valve aneurism.I was born with a bicuspid aorta valve which started leaking. I was shocked after learning the diagnosis. I recieved an onyx valve and a new artery. This was a very good experience under very stressing times.\" His thorough analysis and surgical skill have restored my relative good health and dramatically improved my quality of life.\" I did extensive research using the incredible HeartValveSurgery.com website and selected Dr. Gerdisch because: (1) I wanted a minimally-invasive thoracotomy procedure; and (2) Dr. Gerdisch received superior ratings from his patients. I had high hopes for a smooth and quick recovery, but I have to say my aggressive expectations were exceeded! I'm still surprised that my recovery has been so rapid and smooth. \"Dr. Gerdisch repaired a >6 cm. ascending aortic aneurysm as well as replacing my failing bicuspid aortic valve with a new On-X mechanical valve. The surgery was flawless and I spent only four days in the hospital before being released. Dr. Gerdisch used titanium plates and screws to close and hold my sternum together, a vast improvement over wiring the sternum. My recovery has been remarkable with very little pain. I can, without qualification, recommend this renowned surgeon.\" \"The first time that Dr. Gerdisch saw me he told me in a confident, but humble manner that he was the best man to do the type of surgery that I required. My first thought was, \"Whether that is true or not, it had better be true when you step up to the table to work on me.\" It turns out that he is confident for a reason. He is the best. My case was complicated by the fact that I have Parkinsons Disease, also. Dr. Gerdisch didn't just blow her off as being unimportant as some other doctors may have. Upon release from the hospital, he took the time to explain the care plan with her. He gave an excellent explanation of what was going to happen, with confidence and a willingness to answer all my questions. Not having a sternotomy played a huge part in my quick recovery. He is also truly interested in patient outcome and progress. I had very little pain and the recovery time was extremely shorter than my first surgery. Have nothing but high regards and confidence in him.\" \"I am one of Jehovahs Witnesses and Dr. Gerdisch quickly assured me of his willingness to work with me regarding bloodless surgery to replace my aortic heart valve. I had complete confidence I had found the best surgeon and my date was set for June 1, 2016. I had no doubt he would honor my convictions regarding my faith and that was the most important quality to me. I have enough body aches and pains that I did not want to get the surgery done due to that they split your chest open. Let me tell you that I am really glad I did go talk to Dr. Marc Gerdisch. There are not enough nice and great things I can say about Dr. Gerdisch. He is down to Earth and was easy to talk to. It seems like everyone has heard of him and nothing but positive things to said about him. Whether you are from Indiana or Florida, California, Alaska, Maine or wherever don’t do it without seeing Dr Gerdisch. Google his name and read about him. It’s been seven weeks and I’m doing great just waiting to get clearance from D.O.T then I’m back to work. In a brief closing statement. During my operation, he performed several procedures including repairing the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, performed the maze procedure for A-fib and reduced the size of my enlarge atrial chambers back to the normal size. but with his thousands of successful surgeries as his experience, he performed them successfully. At 8 weeks, I am walking over 5000 steps per day, enrolled in a rehab program, and feel very good. I have every reason to believe that I will make a full recovery. I would recommend Dr, Gerdisch to anyone who knows they have one chance to get it right, so why not go to the best.\" I had done lot of research before my operation on who is the best at what he does and his name kept coming up. He is the best! That is why I came to him. Was back to jogging after my one month post-op with him.\" \"The manner in which Dr. Gerdisch operates his practice gives high confidence that one's particular case is receiving personal attention and that alleviates the natural anxiety of significant surgery. His intensity, attention, and clarity give one absolute confidence that one is in the right hands for a major life event. Nurse Practitioner, Tara Lowe, was also especially helpful at various stages of this lengthy process. The level of professionalism and empathy I experienced in every encounter was truly special. He predicts with high confidence that my heart will now outlast the rest of my body. I am recovering very well on a supervised exercise program.\" \"100% satisfied. He is very easy to talk with, answered all my questions and kept me informed. I can't imagine a better experience than I've enjoyed with Dr. Gerdisch. \"Outstanding! Made me feel like I was his only patient. He also found and repaired an aneurysm in my aorta that I didn't know I had. \"I highly recommend Dr. Gerdisch!\" \"Diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis. I had alot of anxiety about what i was about to undergo but after meeting with Dr. Gerdisch i found him to be very reassuring and thorough in his explanation of what i was about to experience. He is a very positive and pleasant physican who has outstanding credentials. \"Can't say enough about Dr. Gerdisch. Doesn't take much of an internet search to learn that he's a superstar. I would have definitely traveled to experience his gifts and talents.\" \"Couldn't of had a better experience with my surgeon, Dr. Marc Gerdisch, the hospital, St Francis Indianapolis and Indiana Heart Physicians where I had my initial appointment with Dr. Ryan Daly. \"Marc Gerdisch is outstanding. Marc is known nationally and goes all around speaking about his techniques, some of which he pioneered. He has great empathy for his patients. He is glib with a great sense of humor that cannot help but put you at ease. They are so supportive and are a real team. The other advantage that Dr. Gerdisch has and offers is Franciscan St. Francis hospital in Indianapolis. I had, by far, the best treatment of any place that I am familiar with. \"After thorough research, it was a no brainer to go with Dr Gerdisch for my AVR. His credentials and accomplishments are impressive. Dr Gerdisch is very competent and confident in his practice and leads his entire team to give their utmost best for the patient while expecting no less. During my journey of office visits, I noticed that anyone familiar with him spoke nothing but very highly in his regard. Furthermore, my entire family was astonished with the communication, care, compassion, and consideration given during my surgery. Adverse morphological changes in my heart that occurred due to my bad valve have already begun repairing. Dr. Gerdisch spent all the time necessary with me to explain and answer all questions. \"This man is a God-given blessing. His work is impeccable, and definitely shortens your recovery from start to finish. I came through with no pain, and home in 6 days. Oh did I mention he is no. You can reach him at: Cardiac Surgery Associates, S.C. 5255 East Stop 11 Road Ste. 46237 (317)851-2331 \"\n\"Dr. Gerdisch has excellent bedside manner, always dressed impeccably when he met patients, he showed a lot of respect for his patients and his position, He is very patient and gave expert answers to all my questions before and after the surgery. My mitral was in pretty bad shape judging by the severe back flow I had at the time, looking at the picture before surgery part of it already loose from its detachment. As an expert in \"aggressive heart valve repairment\" Marc was able to save and repair it instead of doing a valve replacement, I am very grateful for that. The surgery went smoothly ( include mitral valve repair and reinforcement, a single bypass) and took 4-5 hours. From my opinion Dr. Marc Gerdisch is a genius at what he does. Some nurses told me Marc is like a machine on surgical table because of his quickness, his precision and his many unique ways of doing things. The bovine tissue valve showed a rapid calcification and deteriorated quickly. In selecting a hospital and surgeon, I felt a strong appreciation of the Franciscan St. Francis Hospital surgical care model, their ranking as one of the top hospitals for cardiac care nationally, and the record of Dr. Marc Gerdisch's surgical accomplishments. Most impressively, he listened to my numerous concerns that were based on my previous experience and addressed each one, thereby minimizing the post-surgergical complications and distress. My progress toward recovery is significantly more rapid and less painful than the first surgery - note \"re-do\" surgeries are typically higher risk and often associated with more complications and longer recovery times. With confidence, I can definitely recommend Dr. Gerdisch based on my experience. \" Gerdisch.\" They made sure we understood all the procedures and treatments before and during and after the surgery. I have more energy now that the valves have been repaired. I can not say enought about Dr. Gerdisch and his team. I would recommend them to anyone facing heart susrgery. They are the best. \" \"Outstanding. From diagnosis to testing to surgery to recovery to rehab. Gerdisch.\" \"My cardiovascular surgeon is one of the finest surgeons you will find any where in the United States and he should be at the top of any one list seeking to have heart valve surgery!! Surgery was the morning of March 16th 2015 and by the 19th day of March, I was walking out of the hospital feeling great!! What do you offer a man that has given you another chance at life?? I could not have asked for better quicker and more caring service from the receptionist to the housekeepers to the kitchen service and great meals and service to the nurses and doctors!! My family was also impressed and we would highly recommend Doctor Gerdisch and his team to anyone any time! \"I cannot recommend Dr Gerdisch enough. He is so experienced and so professional. I was impressed from the first meeting and everything went so well. I am pleased that his skills allowed me to recover faster and have less of a scar.\" I felt great without pain or discomfort. \"Very compassionate but also very business like. \"I was very impressed with Dr. Gerdisch and everyone on his staff. A very high level of care. His NP Tara is excellent, and very helpful. I highly recomend him.\" \"Dr. Gerdisch is a pro at what he does. I felt like I was in the hands of the very best. I had excellent results and would not hesitate to recommend him very highly. The entire experience was nothing but exceptional, from surgery, to the hospital stay at St. Francis, to the follow-up care. If you desire a surgeon and entire medical team you can have confidence in, this is THE ONE! \" If they did not jump all over my case as quick as they did, I would not have made to this years Thanksgiving. My recovery, the surgery and everything leading up to and following the operation was also made smooth and easy by the Dr. Gerdisch staff. Do all the research you want, the more you read, the more impressed you will become. On day 5, I was able to go home and back to work. Dr. Gerdisch was a perfect match and is so kind, caring, and genuinely interested in me as a patient. The scar is the very minimal, and the surgery itself was literally pain free. They both saved my life!\" I was scared about all of this at my young age! He gave me a book to read on the surgery and gave assurance that I would do fine. Gerdisch!\" There was only a seven centimeter cut through the sternum, not through the length of the sternum. They all kept pain to a minimum. Their goal was to keep pain at or near 3 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst. Pain was manageable; they never allowed it to get bad. It would be impossible for me to recommend Dr. Gerdisch too highly.\" Thank you for my second chance at life.\" \"Unlike any other operation that I have had, Dr Gerdisch explained the operation in easy to understand English that I understood what he was going to do, answered all my questions and I had many. He took the time to put my mind at ease. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr Gerdisch. God blessed this man with a humble nature and incredible skills and wisdom.\" \"Dr. Marc Gerdisch... You can look up all the facts and statistics, but what you can't find online is what an amazing human being this man is. He and his entire staff made me feel comfortable the minute I met them. My mind was put at ease immediately. \"Great!, fantastic, super. Dr. Gerdisch was so good to explain what was going to happen. He made me feel like I was in good hands and I was. He is a human dynamo, while at the same time an humble and unassuming gentleman. He is eager to answer questions in understandable terms. He appears driven to treat his patients in the best possible manner. He has the admirable trait of giving credit for his success to his family, friends, patients and associates. He has a genuine smile which he uses often and effectively. From that moment on, I can say with no reservation, there was absolutely no trepidation. A calm peaceful feeling that remains with me to this day. I feel that God guides his every thought, diagnosis, decision, counsel with patients and his hands during surgery. And my recovery has been better than expected and the scar is minimal.\" \"Everything was perfect from the pre-surgery through the post-surgery. I also had a ascending aortic aneurysm and some other thing to be fixed. Now, here I was looking at open heart surgery and it was scary. I didn't just want a good doctor, I wanted the best. He answered all of our questions and explained what he would be doing. I'm confident he not only extended my life but also is giving me an opportunity to have a higher quality of life. Marc is straight forward with explanations and takes the time required for full understanding of what is going to happen. He was always honest about all aspects and expectations and provided all the answers to our questions and concerns with patience. They were also informative and helpful afterward -- which helped me prepare for my healing process and what to expect. \"Dr. Marc Gerdisch made such a difference in my life. I heard great things about Dr. Gerdisch and made an appointment to meet with him. \"I was amazed that this life and death situation went off so smoothly. Gerdisch!\" \"Dr. Gerdisch and St. Francis was excellent in every way.\" My surgery was extremely high risk. I had been declined surgery by two other surgeons. After meeting with Dr. Gerdisch and the confidence he exuded, my mind was put at ease that he was the man and that I had hope! Nine months later I feel better than I have felt in five or six years and am so appreciative of his expertise. I am a survivor due to his superior talent and confidence and that of his staff!\" \"I was very impressed with Dr Gerdisch's accomplishments and skills. My results are astounding.\" He was great in my pre-surgery consultation, while in the hospital and my 6 week check-up. I have complete confidence in his abilities. He was patient in answering my questions, and it was clear that he had the skills and experience to handle my case. The first is that I am blest with each new day and thankful to God for the ongoing enjoyment of life. Along the way however, from the very first realization that I had a problem, to the understanding of the extent of the damage to my valve, to replacing the valve, to today when I feel so blessed, there are many who have contributed to the success. The great surgical skill that was displayed during the surgery, further evidenced during my recovery and the manner which my incision has healed are evidence of the great care taken throughout the procedure. The healing of my incision has left me with essentially no lingering effects, neither physical nor cosmetic. The skill of Dr. Gerdisch was not relegated to surgery alone. The pre and post operative care was just that, concerned care. That trust was never violated and has only grown as my vitality has increased. This entire experience bodes well for an active life for many years. The caring spirit of Dr. Gerdisch would have been welcome anywhere. A totally curative environment and experience. \" I feel youthful and energetic. I feel like I have my life back but even better than before.\" I am doing super! Dr. Gerdisch evaluated me and immediately realized that unless I had immediate surgical intervention that my life was at great risk. I had no idea that I was in atrial fibrillation and heart failure. I know that Dr. Gerdisch through his training, expertise, talent, concern and compassion saved my life. \"I recently dropped off one of the first copies of a book that I have just written at Dr. Gerdisch’s office. In it I wrote a very simple yet heartfelt expression of appreciation: “Thank you for saving my life.” I had walked around for a few weeks wondering if my next step would be my last and learned later that in fact I would have died in a very short period of time had the surgery not been performed. He is at the absolute peak of his profession and has an exceptional ability to relate to his patients and to others. While I was in the hospital post surgery a great many persons expressed to me how talented they thought he was. I later learned that Dr. Gerdisch is a world renowned heart surgeon who in addition to performing surgeries travels extensively worldwide to lecture and train other heart surgeons. He has been in the forefront and a pioneer in developing new concepts and new techniques. Membership is limited to 65 surgeons. Following surgery I was restricted from playing for a period of 13 weeks. I was able to return quickly because of the condition I was in prior to surgery and the effort I had put into rehabilitation. I should also note that I was released from the hospital in four days, which my cardiologist described as “absolutely amazing.” I am commenting on this not to pat myself on the back but to give encouragement to others. The book that I have written is entitled “Racing the Wind; Seventy-seven and Still Playing Full-Court, Fast-Break Basketball: Achieving Athletic Longevity, A Gift That Keeps on Giving.” A vignette in the book describes my experience as an open heart surgery patient in more detail.

Returning people to their life is an incredible experience I am privileged to share with my patients and entire team, every day. My central role in developing a program with a theme of excellence in the diagnosis and treatment of heart valve disease allows me to perform approximately 300 cardiac surgeries each year, spanning from transcatheter valve replacement and minimally invasive valve repair, to multi-valve reoperations and adult congenital cardiac surgery. In addition, for the past fifteen years, I have been dedicated to ensuring excellence in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and have trained hundreds of surgeons to address atrial fibrillation for their patients. I have the good fortune to participate in trials and research that have enhanced our ability to achieve these goals. I trained for seven years at Loyola Medical Center in Chicago and remain on staff. I have the luxury and my patients have the benefit, of being part of a process based on excellent communication and collaboration among some of the finest health care professionals working in cardiac care. As a founding member of ERAS Cardiac (Enhanced Recover After Surgery) I have merged many of our program initiatives with other progressive programs around the world, to share practice excellence. In addition to leading edge valve therapies, we have integrated an exceptional set of skills and practices to minimize discomfort and accelerate recover. By combining minimally invasive procedures with advance local nerve block and providing rigid fixation for all patients requiring sternotomy, we have dramatically diminished any early limitations on activity and hastened restoration to a full life. My team and I deliver the care we would want for our own family. In my opinion, he is a very talented surgeon. My motto is a “ton of gain with zero pain.” I would highly recommend Dr. Gerdisch and his team. \"I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Marc Gerdisch. I first met him in 2007 after my 1 and only afib experience. I was sent to talk to him again in early 2018 by my cardiologist Dr. Rao. We met and came to the conclusion that it was time to replace my aortic root which was now 5.0cm and repair my moderate to severe leaking aortic valve. He has a great way of making you feel comfortable. He did successfully repair and save my aortic valve as well as replacing my aortic root too. He has saved my life and I look forward to a long full life to enjoy with my wife and daughter. \"Surgery was actually for my 85 year old father, HAROLD R. DEMERLY. Hospital staff was friendly, we were greeted with smiles and personally escorted to the appropriate area of hospital, after registering. Dr. Gerdisch's staff was kind and made us feel like we have known them all for a long time, even though we were just meeting them. The team work between Dr. Shaikh & his staff and Dr. Gerdisch & his staff made my father and our family feel comfortable that we were where we should be. I bought Adam Pick's book (wow, he went through a lot of issues), fired up the web and talked with many acquaintances that had undergone heart surgery. However, I had plenty of time to research, and I did! Now I know that my choice of Dr. Marc Gerdisch as the surgeon for my severely stenotic aortic valve replacement was the right one. In my case, he was able to perform a minimally-invasive procedure (with a horizontal incision about three inches long) which is resulting in a shorter recovery period (eleven days now since operation, six of them in the hospital). Sure, Gerdisch has a number of \"firsts\" in the field and is, obviously, an intelligent researcher; but he's also a dedicated, hard-working guy! So, do the research necessary for your particular circumstance! But if Dr. Marc Gerdisch comes into your browser, give him a serious look. I feel that you will be glad you did!\" I had an ascending aortic aneurysm that needed repaired and needed an aortic mechanical onyx valve placed. He is so articulate, smart, professional and caring! You could not go wrong by picking Dr Gerdisch! I would reccomend him to anyone! I am truly blessed to have known to go to Dr Gerdisch! He is one in a million! \"I was diagnosed with aortic stenosis. Dr. Gerdisch took the time to explain to me everything that was going on and what he would be doing. He encouraged me to ask any questions that I might have. He even explained to me that my children had a chance of having the same defect. My daughter was with me and he took the time to listen to her heart and order a test for her. \"This was a very informed and good experience. His assistant, Tara was always very helpful giving me the confidence that my progress was on tract. I was able to use my arms right away, and I feel it reduced my recovery time by at least 2 weeks. \"Dr Gerdisch is Awesome and I owe him my life!!! Once I met him, I knew I was in great hands. I am a complicated case as I am told, I am dialysis patient, prior open heart - 7 bypass, double leg amputee, vascular disease, Gillian barre and cancer survivor with many drug allergies. Dr Gerdisch stated that he did something that he has not performed before. He did not want to open up my sternum because I need my arms to transfer since I am an amputee. The recovery time would be too long and rigorous. I would recommend him.\" \"Dr. Marc Gerdisch and associates provided top-notch care for my mother throughout the whole process. I did not want the open heart surgery if possible, but that was the only option in my mother's immediate area. I searched for a highly respected doctor within my mother's network who wasn't too far away. They not only do the job medically, but they really care for their patients as not just patients, but family whom they are helping get back on their feet!\" \"I could tell he was A-1......have been told not every surgeon could have fixed me. But I healed up fast and was able to use my arms right away. Unfortunately, I had Seratonin Syndrome, and it has affected much more than the surgery. The doctors at St Francis are wonderful.....but Dr. Gerdish is top level.\" \"I was diagnosed with an ascending aortic valve aneurism.I was born with a bicuspid aorta valve which started leaking. I was shocked after learning the diagnosis. I recieved an onyx valve and a new artery. This was a very good experience under very stressing times.\" His thorough analysis and surgical skill have restored my relative good health and dramatically improved my quality of life.\" I did extensive research using the incredible HeartValveSurgery.com website and selected Dr. Gerdisch because: (1) I wanted a minimally-invasive thoracotomy procedure; and (2) Dr. Gerdisch received superior ratings from his patients. I had high hopes for a smooth and quick recovery, but I have to say my aggressive expectations were exceeded! I'm still surprised that my recovery has been so rapid and smooth. \"Dr. Gerdisch repaired a >6 cm. ascending aortic aneurysm as well as replacing my failing bicuspid aortic valve with a new On-X mechanical valve. The surgery was flawless and I spent only four days in the hospital before being released. Dr. Gerdisch used titanium plates and screws to close and hold my sternum together, a vast improvement over wiring the sternum. My recovery has been remarkable with very little pain. I can, without qualification, recommend this renowned surgeon.\" \"The first time that Dr. Gerdisch saw me he told me in a confident, but humble manner that he was the best man to do the type of surgery that I required. My first thought was, \"Whether that is true or not, it had better be true when you step up to the table to work on me.\" It turns out that he is confident for a reason. He is the best. My case was complicated by the fact that I have Parkinsons Disease, also. Dr. Gerdisch didn't just blow her off as being unimportant as some other doctors may have. Upon release from the hospital, he took the time to explain the care plan with her. He gave an excellent explanation of what was going to happen, with confidence and a willingness to answer all my questions. Not having a sternotomy played a huge part in my quick recovery. He is also truly interested in patient outcome and progress. I had very little pain and the recovery time was extremely shorter than my first surgery. Have nothing but high regards and confidence in him.\" \"I am one of Jehovahs Witnesses and Dr. Gerdisch quickly assured me of his willingness to work with me regarding bloodless surgery to replace my aortic heart valve. I had complete confidence I had found the best surgeon and my date was set for June 1, 2016. I had no doubt he would honor my convictions regarding my faith and that was the most important quality to me. I have enough body aches and pains that I did not want to get the surgery done due to that they split your chest open. Let me tell you that I am really glad I did go talk to Dr. Marc Gerdisch. There are not enough nice and great things I can say about Dr. Gerdisch. He is down to Earth and was easy to talk to. It seems like everyone has heard of him and nothing but positive things to said about him. Whether you are from Indiana or Florida, California, Alaska, Maine or wherever don’t do it without seeing Dr Gerdisch. Google his name and read about him. It’s been seven weeks and I’m doing great just waiting to get clearance from D.O.T then I’m back to work. In a brief closing statement. During my operation, he performed several procedures including repairing the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, performed the maze procedure for A-fib and reduced the size of my enlarge atrial chambers back to the normal size. but with his thousands of successful surgeries as his experience, he performed them successfully. At 8 weeks, I am walking over 5000 steps per day, enrolled in a rehab program, and feel very good. I have every reason to believe that I will make a full recovery. I would recommend Dr, Gerdisch to anyone who knows they have one chance to get it right, so why not go to the best.\" I had done lot of research before my operation on who is the best at what he does and his name kept coming up. He is the best! That is why I came to him. Was back to jogging after my one month post-op with him.\" \"The manner in which Dr. Gerdisch operates his practice gives high confidence that one's particular case is receiving personal attention and that alleviates the natural anxiety of significant surgery. His intensity, attention, and clarity give one absolute confidence that one is in the right hands for a major life event. Nurse Practitioner, Tara Lowe, was also especially helpful at various stages of this lengthy process. The level of professionalism and empathy I experienced in every encounter was truly special. He predicts with high confidence that my heart will now outlast the rest of my body. I am recovering very well on a supervised exercise program.\" \"100% satisfied. He is very easy to talk with, answered all my questions and kept me informed. I can't imagine a better experience than I've enjoyed with Dr. Gerdisch. \"Outstanding! Made me feel like I was his only patient. He also found and repaired an aneurysm in my aorta that I didn't know I had. \"I highly recommend Dr. Gerdisch!\" \"Diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis. I had alot of anxiety about what i was about to undergo but after meeting with Dr. Gerdisch i found him to be very reassuring and thorough in his explanation of what i was about to experience. He is a very positive and pleasant physican who has outstanding credentials. \"Can't say enough about Dr. Gerdisch. Doesn't take much of an internet search to learn that he's a superstar. I would have definitely traveled to experience his gifts and talents.\" \"Couldn't of had a better experience with my surgeon, Dr. Marc Gerdisch, the hospital, St Francis Indianapolis and Indiana Heart Physicians where I had my initial appointment with Dr. Ryan Daly. \"Marc Gerdisch is outstanding. Marc is known nationally and goes all around speaking about his techniques, some of which he pioneered. He has great empathy for his patients. He is glib with a great sense of humor that cannot help but put you at ease. They are so supportive and are a real team. The other advantage that Dr. Gerdisch has and offers is Franciscan St. Francis hospital in Indianapolis. I had, by far, the best treatment of any place that I am familiar with. \"After thorough research, it was a no brainer to go with Dr Gerdisch for my AVR. His credentials and accomplishments are impressive. Dr Gerdisch is very competent and confident in his practice and leads his entire team to give their utmost best for the patient while expecting no less. During my journey of office visits, I noticed that anyone familiar with him spoke nothing but very highly in his regard. Furthermore, my entire family was astonished with the communication, care, compassion, and consideration given during my surgery. Adverse morphological changes in my heart that occurred due to my bad valve have already begun repairing. Dr. Gerdisch spent all the time necessary with me to explain and answer all questions. \"This man is a God-given blessing. His work is impeccable, and definitely shortens your recovery from start to finish. I came through with no pain, and home in 6 days. Oh did I mention he is no. You can reach him at: Cardiac Surgery Associates, S.C. 5255 East Stop 11 Road Ste. 46237 (317)851-2331 \"\n\"Dr. Gerdisch has excellent bedside manner, always dressed impeccably when he met patients, he showed a lot of respect for his patients and his position, He is very patient and gave expert answers to all my questions before and after the surgery. My mitral was in pretty bad shape judging by the severe back flow I had at the time, looking at the picture before surgery part of it already loose from its detachment. As an expert in \"aggressive heart valve repairment\" Marc was able to save and repair it instead of doing a valve replacement, I am very grateful for that. The surgery went smoothly ( include mitral valve repair and reinforcement, a single bypass) and took 4-5 hours. From my opinion Dr. Marc Gerdisch is a genius at what he does. Some nurses told me Marc is like a machine on surgical table because of his quickness, his precision and his many unique ways of doing things. The bovine tissue valve showed a rapid calcification and deteriorated quickly. In selecting a hospital and surgeon, I felt a strong appreciation of the Franciscan St. Francis Hospital surgical care model, their ranking as one of the top hospitals for cardiac care nationally, and the record of Dr. Marc Gerdisch's surgical accomplishments. Most impressively, he listened to my numerous concerns that were based on my previous experience and addressed each one, thereby minimizing the post-surgergical complications and distress. My progress toward recovery is significantly more rapid and less painful than the first surgery - note \"re-do\" surgeries are typically higher risk and often associated with more complications and longer recovery times. With confidence, I can definitely recommend Dr. Gerdisch based on my experience. \" Gerdisch.\" They made sure we understood all the procedures and treatments before and during and after the surgery. I have more energy now that the valves have been repaired. I can not say enought about Dr. Gerdisch and his team. I would recommend them to anyone facing heart susrgery. They are the best. \" \"Outstanding. From diagnosis to testing to surgery to recovery to rehab. Gerdisch.\" \"My cardiovascular surgeon is one of the finest surgeons you will find any where in the United States and he should be at the top of any one list seeking to have heart valve surgery!! Surgery was the morning of March 16th 2015 and by the 19th day of March, I was walking out of the hospital feeling great!! What do you offer a man that has given you another chance at life?? I could not have asked for better quicker and more caring service from the receptionist to the housekeepers to the kitchen service and great meals and service to the nurses and doctors!! My family was also impressed and we would highly recommend Doctor Gerdisch and his team to anyone any time! \"I cannot recommend Dr Gerdisch enough. He is so experienced and so professional. I was impressed from the first meeting and everything went so well. I am pleased that his skills allowed me to recover faster and have less of a scar.\" I felt great without pain or discomfort. \"Very compassionate but also very business like. \"I was very impressed with Dr. Gerdisch and everyone on his staff. A very high level of care. His NP Tara is excellent, and very helpful. I highly recomend him.\" \"Dr. Gerdisch is a pro at what he does. I felt like I was in the hands of the very best. I had excellent results and would not hesitate to recommend him very highly. The entire experience was nothing but exceptional, from surgery, to the hospital stay at St. Francis, to the follow-up care. If you desire a surgeon and entire medical team you can have confidence in, this is THE ONE! \" If they did not jump all over my case as quick as they did, I would not have made to this years Thanksgiving. My recovery, the surgery and everything leading up to and following the operation was also made smooth and easy by the Dr. Gerdisch staff. Do all the research you want, the more you read, the more impressed you will become. On day 5, I was able to go home and back to work. Dr. Gerdisch was a perfect match and is so kind, caring, and genuinely interested in me as a patient. The scar is the very minimal, and the surgery itself was literally pain free. They both saved my life!\" I was scared about all of this at my young age! He gave me a book to read on the surgery and gave assurance that I would do fine. Gerdisch!\" There was only a seven centimeter cut through the sternum, not through the length of the sternum. They all kept pain to a minimum. Their goal was to keep pain at or near 3 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst. Pain was manageable; they never allowed it to get bad. It would be impossible for me to recommend Dr. Gerdisch too highly.\" Thank you for my second chance at life.\" \"Unlike any other operation that I have had, Dr Gerdisch explained the operation in easy to understand English that I understood what he was going to do, answered all my questions and I had many. He took the time to put my mind at ease. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr Gerdisch. God blessed this man with a humble nature and incredible skills and wisdom.\" \"Dr. Marc Gerdisch... You can look up all the facts and statistics, but what you can't find online is what an amazing human being this man is. He and his entire staff made me feel comfortable the minute I met them. My mind was put at ease immediately. \"Great!, fantastic, super. Dr. Gerdisch was so good to explain what was going to happen. He made me feel like I was in good hands and I was. He is a human dynamo, while at the same time an humble and unassuming gentleman. He is eager to answer questions in understandable terms. He appears driven to treat his patients in the best possible manner. He has the admirable trait of giving credit for his success to his family, friends, patients and associates. He has a genuine smile which he uses often and effectively. From that moment on, I can say with no reservation, there was absolutely no trepidation. A calm peaceful feeling that remains with me to this day. I feel that God guides his every thought, diagnosis, decision, counsel with patients and his hands during surgery. And my recovery has been better than expected and the scar is minimal.\" \"Everything was perfect from the pre-surgery through the post-surgery. I also had a ascending aortic aneurysm and some other thing to be fixed. Now, here I was looking at open heart surgery and it was scary. I didn't just want a good doctor, I wanted the best. He answered all of our questions and explained what he would be doing. I'm confident he not only extended my life but also is giving me an opportunity to have a higher quality of life. Marc is straight forward with explanations and takes the time required for full understanding of what is going to happen. He was always honest about all aspects and expectations and provided all the answers to our questions and concerns with patience. They were also informative and helpful afterward -- which helped me prepare for my healing process and what to expect. \"Dr. Marc Gerdisch made such a difference in my life. I heard great things about Dr. Gerdisch and made an appointment to meet with him. \"I was amazed that this life and death situation went off so smoothly. Gerdisch!\" \"Dr. Gerdisch and St. Francis was excellent in every way.\" My surgery was extremely high risk. I had been declined surgery by two other surgeons. After meeting with Dr. Gerdisch and the confidence he exuded, my mind was put at ease that he was the man and that I had hope! Nine months later I feel better than I have felt in five or six years and am so appreciative of his expertise. I am a survivor due to his superior talent and confidence and that of his staff!\" \"I was very impressed with Dr Gerdisch's accomplishments and skills. My results are astounding.\" He was great in my pre-surgery consultation, while in the hospital and my 6 week check-up. I have complete confidence in his abilities. He was patient in answering my questions, and it was clear that he had the skills and experience to handle my case. The first is that I am blest with each new day and thankful to God for the ongoing enjoyment of life. Along the way however, from the very first realization that I had a problem, to the understanding of the extent of the damage to my valve, to replacing the valve, to today when I feel so blessed, there are many who have contributed to the success. The great surgical skill that was displayed during the surgery, further evidenced during my recovery and the manner which my incision has healed are evidence of the great care taken throughout the procedure. The healing of my incision has left me with essentially no lingering effects, neither physical nor cosmetic. The skill of Dr. Gerdisch was not relegated to surgery alone. The pre and post operative care was just that, concerned care. That trust was never violated and has only grown as my vitality has increased. This entire experience bodes well for an active life for many years. The caring spirit of Dr. Gerdisch would have been welcome anywhere. A totally curative environment and experience. \" I feel youthful and energetic. I feel like I have my life back but even better than before.\" I am doing super! Dr. Gerdisch evaluated me and immediately realized that unless I had immediate surgical intervention that my life was at great risk. I had no idea that I was in atrial fibrillation and heart failure. I know that Dr. Gerdisch through his training, expertise, talent, concern and compassion saved my life. \"I recently dropped off one of the first copies of a book that I have just written at Dr. Gerdisch’s office. In it I wrote a very simple yet heartfelt expression of appreciation: “Thank you for saving my life.” I had walked around for a few weeks wondering if my next step would be my last and learned later that in fact I would have died in a very short period of time had the surgery not been performed.

Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area?\nA.
