It derives from the Latin strātum (plural '; parallel, horizontal layers) referring to a given society's categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers based on factors like wealth, income, social status, occupation and power. In modern Western societies, stratification is often broadly classified into three major divisions of social class: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Social may also be delineated on the basis of kinship ties or caste relations. Social mobility refers to the upward or downward movement in the social hierarchy. One key factor that can influence social mobility is education. Economic factors also play a crucial role in social mobility. In some societies, there may be more rigid social structures and barriers to upward mobility, while in others, there may be a greater emphasis on meritocracy and equal opportunities. It is important to note that social mobility is a complex process influenced by a combination of factors. In modern Western societies, social stratification is typically defined in terms of three social classes: the upper class, the middle class, and the lower class; in turn, each class can be subdivided into the upper-stratum, the middle-stratum, and the lower stratum.
