THE CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS MINDS\n\nThere is a section in Studies on Hysteria entitled \"Unconscious Ideas and Ideas Inadmissible to Consciousness—Splitting of the Mind,\" written by Breuer.It is clear that we are two different people—one of them conscious and the other unconscious.How did Breuer and Freud see the split mind?In Studies on Hysteria the unconscious is described as a shadowy place inhabited by ideas that were not strong enough to be conscious, but which, if circumstances warranted, could be retrieved and brought into consciousness. Sigmund Freud, now considered the founder of psychoanalysis, first proposed in 1905 that there are both conscious and unconscious aspects to the mind. He developed this theory over the next 20 years, and postulated that unconscious forces deriving from deeply ingrained value systems originating from parents or society (the superego), or instinctive drives (the id), could, together with pressures in one's external life, challenge and cause conflict with the conscious self (the ego). Freud proposed that the healthy child has to progress appropriately through oral, anal, phallic, latent and genital phases in order to mature as a healthy adult, and problems encountered in any of the stages could result in lasting psychological disorder. Freud's theories and their rigid distinctions are less accepted nowadays, but his beliefs that the psyche undergoes progressive development throughout childhood, and that unconscious material originating from episodes scattered along the course of that development can persist to lead to mental illness, still very much influence modern psychotherapeutic practice. The concept of defense mechanisms, proposed first by Freud and later developed by his daughter Anna Freud, is one that is still very much recognized in modern psychology. The proposal of repression as a defense mechanism in psychology is credited to Sigmund Freud. Freud, an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, developed the concept of repression as a way for the mind to unconsciously block or suppress distressing thoughts, memories, and desires. According to Freud, these repressed contents would remain in the unconscious mind, influencing our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors without our conscious awareness. His theory of repression played a significant role in understanding how the unconscious mind influences human behavior and continues to be influential in psychology today.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about formal logic.

These emergencies include severe infections, heart attacks, strokes, toxic ingestions, fractures and major trauma. Our department also has an established Extended Diagnostic and Treatment Unit (EDTU) with various clinical protocols to facilitate and expedite care for our patients. Being affiliated with the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and the MOHH National Residency Program, we are committed to the education of medical students and residents. We continually evaluate our teaching curriculum and have incorporated simulation training and small group discussions to enhance student education. Our Emergency Medicine Department (EMD) at NUH is staffed 24/7 by registered specialists, who work in conjunction with other in-house specialists to provide efficient and quality treatment for all medical and surgical emergencies. The intensified therapy and extended period for diagnostic testing allows illnesses to be accurately assessed and managed at our observational unit. As an Academic Medical Centre EMD, we are committed to deliver high quality clinical care. The EMD provides emergency care in the NUH tertiary Academic Medical Centre. In addition, it also partners Academy of Medicine, Singapore, in providing training for Diploma in Emergency Medicine for doctors working in Singapore who wish to pursue a non-EM specialist track. The EM Clinical Observer and EM Clinical Fellow programs add to the diversity of training opportunities for doctors interested in the specialty of Emergency Medicine.
