Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the point of regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and allosteric regulation. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation and activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus promoting the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while epinephrine and glucagon (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting lipogenesis in favor of fatty acid oxidation via beta-oxidation. Fatty acid metabolism consists of various metabolic processes involving or closely related to fatty acids, a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient category. In catabolism, fatty acids are metabolized to produce energy, mainly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis, when they are completely oxidized to CO2 and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids (mainly in the form of triglycerides) are therefore the foremost storage form of \n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) also known as carnitine acyltransferase I, CPTI, CAT1, CoA:carnitine acyl transferase (CCAT), or palmitoylCoA transferase I, is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the formation of acyl carnitines by catalyzing the transfer of the acyl group of a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA from coenzyme A to l-carnitine. The product is often Palmitoylcarnitine (thus the name), but other fatty acids may also be substrates. This \"preparation\" allows for subsequent movement of the acyl carnitine from the cytosol into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. This enzyme can be inhibited by malonyl CoA, the first committed intermediate produced during fatty acid synthesis. The \"A site\" or \"CoA site\" appears to bind both malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA, as well as other molecules containing coenzyme A, suggesting that the enzyme binds these molecules via interaction with the coenzyme A moiety. It has been suggested that malonyl-CoA may behave as a competitive inhibitor of CPT1A at this site. Unlike the A site, the O site binds to malonyl-CoA via the dicarbonyl group of the malonate moiety of malonyl-CoA. The binding of malonyl-CoA to either the A and O sites inhibits the action of CPT1A by excluding the binding of carnitine to CPT1A. This transfer system is necessary because, while fatty acids are activated (in the form of a thioester linkage to coenzyme A) on the outer mitochondrial membrane, the activated fatty acids must be oxidized within the mitochondrial matrix. Long chain fatty acids such as palmitoyl-CoA, unlike short- and medium-chain fatty acids, cannot freely diffuse through the mitochondrial inner membrane, and require a shuttle system to be transported to the mitochondrial matrix. A translocase then shuttles the acyl carnitine across the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is converted back into palmitoyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, is important in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. This is a result of decreased activity of ACC which causes a subsequent decrease in malonyl-CoA concentrations. These decreased malonyl-CoA levels in turn prevent inhibition of CPT1, causing an ultimate increase in fatty acid oxidation. This rare disorder confers risk for hepatic encephalopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, seizures, and sudden unexpected death in infancy. Such diseases, along with many other health problems, cause free fatty acid (FFA) levels in humans to become elevated, fat to accumulate in skeletal muscle, and decreases the ability of muscles to oxidize fatty acids. The increased levels of malonyl-CoA caused by hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia inhibit CPT1, which causes a subsequent decrease in the transport of long chain fatty acids into muscle and heart mitochondria, decreasing fatty acid oxidation in such cells. Its importance in fatty acid metabolism makes CPT1 a potentially useful enzyme to focus on in the development of treatments of many other metabolic disorders as well. See also \n\n Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A Deficiency\n\nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) is an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism and plays a significant role in metabolic disorders such as diabetes. The oxidation of fatty acids is essential for energy production in various tissues, including the liver, heart, and skeletal muscles. However, in conditions like diabetes, there is often a dysregulation in fatty acid metabolism. Malonyl CoA, which is an intermediate produced during fatty acid synthesis, can inhibit CPT1. In diabetes, there is an elevated concentration of malonyl CoA due to increased fatty acid synthesis and impaired insulin signaling. This elevated malonyl CoA inhibits CPT1, leading to reduced fatty acid oxidation and an accumulation of fatty acids in the cytosol. In the liver, therefore, oxaloacetate is unavailable for condensation with acetyl-CoA when significant gluconeogenesis has been stimulated by low (or absent) insulin and high glucagon concentrations in the blood. Under these circumstances acetyl-CoA is diverted to the formation of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. All cells with mitochondria can take ketones up from the blood and reconvert them into acetyl-CoA, which can\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional medicine.

Structure\n\nMuscles composing rotator cuff\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle spreads out in a horizontal band to insert on the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The subscapularis muscle origin is divided from the remainder of the rotator cuff origins as it is deep to the scapula. These tendinous insertions along with the articular capsule, the coracohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral ligament complex, blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities (i.e. The infraspinatus and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions, while the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon at the entrance of the bicipital groove. The supraspinatus is most commonly involved in a rotator cuff tear. These muscles arise from the scapula and connect to the head of the humerus, forming a cuff at the shoulder joint. They hold the head of the humerus in the small and shallow glenoid fossa of the scapula. The glenohumeral joint has been analogously described as a golf ball (head of the humerus) sitting on a golf tee (glenoid fossa). During abduction of the arm, moving it outward and away from the trunk (torso), the rotator cuff compresses the glenohumeral joint, an action known as concavity compression, in order to allow the large deltoid muscle to further elevate the arm. In addition to stabilizing the glenohumeral joint and controlling humeral head translation, the rotator cuff muscles also perform multiple functions, including abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation of the shoulder. The infraspinatus and subscapularis have significant roles in scapular plane shoulder abduction (scaption), generating forces that are two to three times greater than the force produced by the supraspinatus muscle. The anterior portion of the supraspinatus tendon is submitted to a significantly greater load and stress, and performs its main functional role. Clinical significance\n\nTear\n\nThe tendons at the ends of the rotator cuff muscles can become torn, leading to pain and restricted movement of the arm. A torn rotator cuff can occur following trauma to the shoulder or it can occur through the \"wear and tear\" on tendons, most commonly the supraspinatus tendon found under the acromion. Such injuries are frequently sustained by athletes whose actions include making repetitive throws, athletes such as baseball pitchers, softball pitchers, American football players (especially quarterbacks), firefighters, cheerleaders, weightlifters (especially powerlifters due to extreme weights used in the bench press), rugby players, volleyball players (due to their swinging motions), water polo players, rodeo team ropers, shot put throwers, swimmers, boxers, kayakers, western martial artists, fast bowlers in cricket, tennis players (due to their service motion) and tenpin bowlers due to the repetitive swinging motion of the arm with the weight of a bowling ball. As progression increases after 4–6 weeks, active exercises are now implemented into the rehabilitation process. The infraspinatus and supraspinatus tests have a specificity of 80% to 90%. A common cause of shoulder pain in rotator cuff impingement syndrome is tendinosis, which is an age-related and most often self-limiting condition. Studies show that there is moderate evidence that hypothermia (cold therapy) and exercise therapy used together are more effective than simply waiting for surgery and they suggest the best outcome for non-surgical treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome. Inflammation and fibrosis\nThe rotator interval is a triangular space in the shoulder that is functionally reinforced externally by the coracohumeral ligament and internally by the superior glenohumeral ligament, and traversed by the intra-articular biceps tendon. On imaging, it is defined by the coracoid process at its base, the supraspinatus tendon superiorly and the subscapularis tendon inferiorly. Changes of adhesive capsulitis can be seen at this interval as edema and fibrosis. Pathology at the interval is also associated with glenohumeral and biceps instability. Adhesive capsulitis or \"frozen shoulder\" is often secondary to rotator cuff injury due to post-surgical immobilization. Available treatment options include intra-articular corticosteroid injections to relieve pain in the short-term and electrotherapy, mobilizations, and home exercise programs for long-term pain relief. Pain management \nTreatment for a rotator cuff tear can include rest, ice, physical therapy, and/or surgery. A review of manual therapy and exercise treatments found inconclusive evidence as to whether these treatments were any better than placebo, however \"High quality evidence from one trial suggested that manual therapy and exercise improved function only slightly more than placebo at 22 weeks, was little or no different to placebo in terms of other patient-important outcomes (e.g. Manual therapy \nA systematic review and Meta-analysis study shows manual therapy may help to reduce pain for patient with Rotator cuff tendiopathy, based on low- to moderate-quality evidence. Surgery \nSurgical approaches include acromioplasty (a part of the bone is removed to decrease pressure placed on the rotator cuff tendons), removal of a bursa that is inflamed or swollen, and subacromial decompression (the removal of tissue or bone that is damaged in order to allow more space for the tendons). Surgery may be recommended for patients with an acute, traumatic rotator cuff tear resulting in substantial weakness. The shoulder that is injured is placed in a sling and shoulder flexion or abduction of the arm is avoided for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery (Brewster, 1993). Orthotherapy is an exercise program that aims to restore the motion and strength of the shoulder muscles.

Additional images\n\nSee also\nFrozen shoulder\n\nReferences\n\n \nShoulder\nUpper limb anatomy\n\nde:Oberarm#Rotatorenmanschette\n\nThe rotator cuff is another name for a cluster of 4 different muscles and their tendons that play an important role in providing strength and stability in the shoulder movement. SITS muscles is an abbreviation for this group of muscles with reference to the first letter of their names (Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor and Subscapularis). The muscles originate from the scapula and connect to the head of the humerus, forming a cuff at the glenohumeral joint. Supraspinatus is a small muscle which originates from medial two-thirds of the supraspinous fossa of the scapula and is inserted into the greater tubercle of the humerus. The Teres minor muscle originates from the upper two-thirds of the lateral border of the scapula and is inserted into the inferior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The subscapularis muscle is a bulky triangular muscle originates from medial two-thirds of the costal surface of the scapula and is inserted into the lesser tubercle of the humerus. External rotation, internal rotation, flexion and abduction are different types of upper extremity movements that are carried out by the rotator cuff muscles. They hold the head of the humerus into the small glenoid fossa of the scapula to facilitate the range of motion in the glenohumeral joint and avoid mechanical obstruction. Subscapularis: This muscle keeps the upper arm intact to your shoulder blade and assists in rotation of the arm, hold it straight out and lower it. Chronic overuse, acute injury or gradual aging can cause some serious damage to any one or all of the muscles as well as the ligaments that act as an attachment between the muscles and bone. The muscles find it difficult to carry out small adjustments within the joint that facilitates the humeral head to move smoothly. Collection of fluid within the joint due to inflammation causes the movements to limit. There are narrow bony spaces through which the tendons run, and any change in the movement of the humerus and scapula can cause these spaces to become even narrower. These calcifications may occur along the bony edges of the joint or within the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles. Pain develops slowly and gets worse with lifting the arm to the side or turning it inward. Some nonsurgical treatments can also be used rotator cuff injuries, including steroid injections to decrease inflammation in the tight spaces where the muscle tendons run across the shoulder joint, therapeutic ultrasound, shockwave therapy, and dry needling. The deltoid is responsible for elevating the arm in the scapular plane and its contraction in doing this also elevates the humeral head. To stop this compressing against the undersurface of the acromion the humeral head and injuring the supraspinatus tendon, there is a simultaneous contraction of some of the muscles of the rotator cuff: the infraspinatus and subscapularis primarily perform this role. In spite of this there may be still a 1–3 mm upward movement of the head of the humerus during the first 30° to 60° of arm elevation. The four muscles are the supraspinatus muscle, the infraspinatus muscle, teres minor muscle, and the subscapularis muscle. Structure\n\nMuscles composing rotator cuff\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle spreads out in a horizontal band to insert on the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus.

Cutaneous stimulation of the superficial fibular nerve (SF) would typically occur when the top of the foot encounters an obstacle. The pose has been linked to damage to the common fibular nerve resulting in foot drop, where dorsiflexion of the foot is compromised and the foot drags (the toe points) during walking; and in sensory loss to the surface of the foot and portions of the anterior, lower-lateral leg. Musculoskeletal Dysfunction and Drop Foot: Diagnosis and Management Using Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine. J Am Osteopath Assoc 2009;109(12):648–650. Drop foot arises from dysfunction within the anatomic, muscular, or neurologic aspects of the lower extremity. The authors describe a patient with drop foot who had a compressed common peroneal nerve caused by posterior fibular head dysfunction. It is important for physicians to use osteopathic manipulative medicine to diagnosis and manage this condition, particularly when it results from fibular head dysfunction. As noted by Pritchett,6 “Peroneal neuropathy caused by compression at the fibular head is the most common compressive neuropathy in the lower extremity. Footdrop is its most notable symptom.” In the present report, we describe a patient who developed drop foot secondary to posterior fibular head dysfunction. However, unlike many published reports of drop foot,1,2,7 the condition was diagnosed and managed using osteopathic manipulative medicine. A 47-year-old white man presented to the primary care office noticeably dragging his left foot. He had no trauma to his left leg. He ambulated with a steppage gait. On musculoskeletal examination of the extremities, the patient had normal pulse on palpation (2+ pulses) bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities. Manual testing revealed 5/5 muscle strength throughout the right lower extremity and 1/5 muscle strength in the left lower extremity with ankle dorsiflexion and eversion. Deep tendon reflexes were 1/4 at the Achilles and patellar tendons on the left lower extremity and 2/4 on the right lower extremity. On osteopathic musculoskeletal examination, the patient had left posterior fibular head dysfunction with tenderness on palpation of the left common peroneal nerve. The patient had tight biceps femoris muscle with lateral hamstring Jones' tender points,8 bilaterally. The patient also had hypertonic psoas major and minor muscles bilaterally. The patient was diagnosed as having drop foot secondary to common peroneal nerve impingement from posterior fibular head dysfunction. With the patient in a prone position, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) was applied using muscle energy for the psoas and hamstring muscles and deep articulation for the posterior fibular head. While the fibular head was articulated, the patient noted discomfort but then stated that his foot was getting “warm and tingly.” Articulation was continued for about 1 minute. On re-evaluation, the patient had improved sensation along the dorsum of his foot and demonstrated left foot dorsiflexion with 4/5 motor function. The patient was directed to use exercise band routines to strengthen the dorsiflexors and evertors of his left ankle. The next day, he telephoned the office and stated that he had complete range of motion, strength, and sensation in his left foot. The sciatic nerve develops at the lumbrosacral plexus and travels through the greater sciatic foramen, located 80% of the time beneath the piriformis muscle, and continues along the posterior aspect of the thigh. It divides to form the common peroneal and tibial nerves above the popliteal fossa of the knee. The common peroneal nerve runs a superficial course, close to the periosteum of the fibular neck for approximately 6 cm, covered by only skin and subcutaneous tissue, making it vulnerable to direct insult.1,6,10 For example, it could become compressed at the fibular neck after prolonged squatting.11 Although the patient in the present report was not squatting and denied leaning his left leg against the car door, we believe that the prolonged bent position of his left leg may have caused drop foot. When the fibular head translates posteriorly, the stylus of the fibula translates anteriorly. This motion occurs when the foot is in plantar flexion. If the fibular head was maintained in a posterior position, then the ankle would be restricted in dorsiflexion.12,13 As described in the present report, the patient was unable to dorsiflex his foot, providing evidence that he had a posterior fibular head dysfunction. The biceps femoris muscle has a long head, which originates from the ischial tuberosity and sacrotuberous ligament, and a short head, which originates from the linea aspera and the lateral supra condyle of the femur.14 Insertion of this muscle is on the head of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the tibia. In normal functioning, the biceps femoris muscle provides flexion and lateral rotation of the leg at the knee.14 However, hypertonicity of this muscle could place a posterior draw on the fibular head, causing the common peroneal nerve to be compressed,15 as described in our patient. In the present report, muscle energy to the psoas and hamstring muscles and deep articulation to the fibular head resolved the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the cause of this patient's symptoms was likely secondary to his tight bicep femoris muscle, causing the fibular head to be pulled posteriorly. The posterior fibular head then caused compression of the common peroneal nerve, leading to drop foot. In the present report, proper musculoskeletal examination identified areas of dysfunction, therefore avoiding the use of unnecessary diagnostic studies such as laboratory tests, radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, nerve conduction studies, and electrophysiologic tests.16 The patient had immediate relief of symptoms and normalization of his gait from a simple yet precise OMT technique without the need of more expensive treatment modalities, such as ankle foot orthosis, medications, or invasive treatments (eg, nerve root blocks, spinal decompression, tendon transposition).1,3 Osteopathic physicians with a strong knowledge of anatomy will be able to optimize osteopathic diagnosis and OMT, which can provide cost-effective patient care.

Increased tibialis anterior activity to cause dorsiflexion and inversion (turning the foot inward) of the foot. ; Increased biceps femoris activity will cause knee flexion to raise the foot higher and away from the obstacle. ; Decreased vastus lateralis activity will increase the ability for the biceps femoris to flex the knee to pull it up. Increased gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior activity will provide stiffness to the ankle joint, helping to prevent the spraining of the ankle. Decreased activity of the gastrocnemius will allow for a more complete dorsiflexion and inversion by the tibialis anterior pulling the foot both up and inward, preventing the foot from staying in contact with the potentially damaging surface. The sural nerve innervates the lateral (outside) portion of the foot and could be activated during either the swing or \n\nThis nerve runs lateral to the fibular neck, coming from just posterior to the fibular head and coursing anterior to the fibular neck, where it divides into the deep and superficial fibular nerves.The common fibular (or peroneal) nerve is injured.## 4 Nikolai's clinical picture suggests injury to what structure?In addition, he has reduced sensation over the dorsum of his right foot. (From Browner BD, Jupiter JB, Levine AM, et al: Skeletal Trauma: Basic Science, Management, and Reconstruction, 3rd ed. ## 3 Explain why Nikolai's medial collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament tears led to the tear in his lateral meniscus\n\nIn Nikolai's case, he was hit in the knee from the lateral aspect with his foot planted. The force of the hit abducted his knee joint, rupturing the MCL, and propelled his tibia forward in relation to the femur, rupturing his ACL. Because of the knee abduction, the medial condyle of his femur was essentially lifted off of the medial meniscus, putting the burden of the impact onto the lateral meniscus, which tore in response to shear forces within the joint allowed by his ruptured ACL. It should be noted that the MCL fibers intertwine with those of the medial meniscus, making it possible for chronic damage to the MCL to extend to the medial meniscus. However, in acute injuries, such as Nikolai's, medial meniscus injuries occur only in combination with lateral meniscus injuries. This past season, he suffered a right fibular neck fracture, and the leg was immobilized for several weeks. Since his cast was removed, he has noticed that his right foot \"hangs\" and that he must step higher than he did before in order to prevent his toes from dragging on the ground. On physical examination, testing his foot dorsiflexion reveals 5/5 strength on the left and 2/5 strength on the right. In addition, he has reduced sensation over the dorsum of his right foot. ## 4 Nikolai's clinical picture suggests injury to what structure? The common fibular (or peroneal) nerve is injured. This nerve runs lateral to the fibular neck, coming from just posterior to the fibular head and coursing anterior to the fibular neck, where it divides into the deep and superficial fibular nerves.## 5 How does injury to the common fibular nerve result in footdrop, as seen in Nikolai?Footdrop is characterized by difficulty with or an inability to perform dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, leading to passive plantar flexion and inversion of the foot, especially when walking.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional medicine.
