Significant disputes in which Crawford sat as arbitrator include Larsen v Hawaiian Kingdom, Newfoundland/Nova Scotia Maritime Boundary Arbitration, Vivendi Universal v Argentina, Mondev International v United States of America, Yaung Chi Oo v Myanmar, SGS v Philippines, and the MOX Plant arbitration. In November 2014, he was elected as an ICJ judge with an absolute majority of votes from the UN General Assembly and Security Council, and commenced his term in 2015. He has served as Arbitrator on the Claims Resolution Tribunal for Dormant Accounts in Switzerland and the Appeals Tribunal of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, and currently sits on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Chapter 14 Financial Services Roster. The International Moot Competition on Maritime Arbitration is a simulation of the work of London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) and is designed on the basis of the London Maritime Arbitrators Association Terms. ICC International Court of Arbitration is an institution for the resolution of international commercial disputes. Contrary to what its name suggests, the ICC does not issue formal judgements. Instead, it provides \"judicial supervision of arbitration proceedings.\" However, cases can be administered in any language. In January 2013, the Philippines formally initiated arbitration proceedings against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) across a range of issues, including the latter's historic rights claim over parts or all of the Spratly Islands inside the nine-dash line, which it said was \"without lawful effect\". On 12 July 2016, the tribunal unanimously ruled in favor of the Philippines on most of its submissions. While it would not \"rule on any question of sovereignty over land territory and would not delimit any maritime boundary between the Parties\", it concluded there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters within\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about international law.

Therefore, for a rule of international custom to be established, two elements are required: “an objective one, the repeated behaviour of States ... and a subjective one, the belief that such behaviour depends on a legal obligation (opinio juris sive necessitatis)”. Derived from the consistent practice of (originally) Western states accompanied by opinio juris (the conviction of States that the consistent practice is required by a legal obligation), customary international law is differentiated from acts of comity (mutual recognition of government acts) by the presence of opinio juris (although in some instances, acts of comity have developed into customary international law, i.e. This development is similar to the replacement of customary or common law by codified law in municipal legal settings, but customary international law continues to play a significant role in international law. “Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it.” In cases where practice (of which evidence is given) comprises abstentions from acting, consistency of conduct might not establish the existence of a rule of customary international law. Although the ICJ has frequently referred to opinio juris as being an equal footing with state practice, the role of the psychological element in the creation of customary law is uncertain. Rather, Canadian courts treat the two issues covered by the doctrine—namely, judicial restraint on foreign law matters and the conflict of laws—separately. First, the claims were based on legal principles against forced labour that constitute jus cogens—broadly recognized principles of customary international law. Second, Canadian domestic law incorporates international law, via \n\n(a) it is in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned; ; (b) there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or ; (c) if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, Arguably, res judicata is a general principle of international law under Article 38 (1)(c) of the International Court of Justice Statute. \"The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: ... c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about international law.

It is a unique process that is undertaken by the Human Rights Council, which allows each State to recognise key areas of human rights issue that has had progress in the country, and also to identify further steps and efforts that will be taken to meet their international obligations.

Some but not all provisions in the Convention regarding this immunity reflect customary international law. Consular officers and consular employees have \"functional immunity\" (i.e., immunity from the jurisdiction of the receiving state \"in respect of acts performed in exercise of consular function\"), but do not enjoy the broader \"personal immunity\" accorded to diplomats. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) was first enacted in 1976, generally treating foreign nations as having sovereign immunity from lawsuits within the United States but establishing conditions when a foreign state can be subject to judicial actions within the courts. FSIA has been amended over time to specify such conditions; relevant to this case, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and the Flatow Amendment allowed lawsuits to be taken against those countries that enabled acts of state-sponsored terrorism as designated by the State Department. On August 7, 1998, more than 200 people were killed in simultaneous truck bombings of United States embassies in \n\n Witness immunity from prosecution occurs when a prosecutor grants immunity to a witness in exchange for testimony or production of other evidence. However, if the prosecutor acquires evidence substantiating the crime independently of the witness's testimony, the witness may then be prosecuted. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) was passed in 1976 and generally grants foreign countries sovereign immunity from lawsuits from private American individuals with limited exceptions. The present case was initiated by Joe Cicippio, one of the hostages taken during the Lebanon hostage crisis by Hezbollah and held from 1986 to 1991. Cicippio sued Iran in 1996 under terms of both FSIA and the Flatow Amendment, and as Iran did not send any counsel to defend themselves, the trial was held ex parte for Iran.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about international law.
