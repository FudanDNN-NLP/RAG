The marginal revenue is positive, but it is lower than the price associated with it because lowering the price will: Samuelson indicates this point on the consumer demand curve is where the price is equal to one over one plus the reciprocal of the price elasticity of demand. This rule does not apply to competitive firms \n\n In economics and business, specifically cost accounting, the break-even point (BEP) is the point at which cost or expenses and revenue are equal: there is no net loss or gain, and one has \"broken even\".

Mathematically, we derive the general rule a monopoly uses to maximize monopoly profit through simple calculus. We first depict the basic equation for economic profit, in which the total economic cost varies directly with the quantity produced:\n\nTC = Total costs ; TFC = Total fixed costs ; V = Unit variable cost (variable cost per unit) ; X = Number of units ; TR = S = Total revenue = Sales ; P = (Unit) sales price The assumptions of the CVP model yield the following linear equations for total costs and total revenue (sales):  Total costs = fixed costs + (unit variable cost &times; number of units)  Total revenue = sales price &times; number of unit These are linear because of the assumptions of constant costs and prices, and there is no distinction between units produced and units sold, as these are assumed to be equal. It is only profitable for a firm to keep adding capital when the marginal revenue product of capital, MRPK (the change in total revenue, when there is a unit change of capital input, ∆TR/∆K) is higher than the marginal cost of capital, MCK (marginal cost of obtaining and utilizing a machine, for example).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

In a game process, regardless of the opponent's strategy choice, one of the parties will choose a certain strategy, which is called dominant strategy. If any participant chooses the optimal strategy when the strategies of all other participants are determined, then this combination is defined as a Nash equilibrium. For instance, in rock paper scissors an equilibrium in beliefs would have each player believing the other was equally likely to play each strategy. This interpretation weakens the descriptive power of Nash equilibrium, however, since it is possible in such an equilibrium for each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock in each play of the game, even though over time the probabilities are those of the mixed strategy. Nash won the Nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von Neumann's theory of zero-sum games. In his famous paper, John Forbes Nash proved that there is an equilibrium for every finite game. Pure strategy Nash equilibria are Nash equilibria where all players are playing pure strategies. Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are equilibria where at least one player is playing a mixed strategy. While Nash proved that every finite game has a Nash equilibrium, not all have pure strategy Nash equilibria. For an example of a game that does not have a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, see Matching pennies. the Coordination game, the Prisoner's dilemma, the Stag hunt). ; Number of pure strategy Nash equilibria: A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies which represents mutual best responses to the other strategies. In other words, if every player is playing their part of a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change his or her strategy. Considering only situations where players play a single strategy without randomizing (a pure strategy) a game can have any number of Nash equilibria.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (Ex,y) is calculated with the following formula: Ex,y = Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded for Good X  /   Percentage Change in Price of Good Y The cross-price elasticity may be positive or negative, depending on whether the goods are complements or substitutes. Furthermore, perfect substitutes have a higher cross elasticity of demand than imperfect substitutes do. goods price&mdash;their effective supply of goods&mdash;will be less than their notional supply. The presence of excess demand in one market influences effective demand or supply in another market, which may influence the degree of disequilibrium in the latter market; in turn, the constraints imposed on participants in that market influence their effective demand or supply in the former market. Evidently, the consumer will choose the cheapest bundle. If the prices of the goods differed, there would be no demand for the more expensive good. Producers and sellers of perfect substitute goods directly compete with each other, that is, they are known to be in direct price competition. ; A positive income elasticity of demand is associated with normal goods; an increase in income will lead to a rise in quantity demanded. The most commonly used elasticity in economics, the price elasticity of demand, is almost always negative, but many goods have positive income elasticities, many have negative. Cross-price elasticity helps us understand the degree of substitutability of the two products.

As a result, some economists have suggested that pecuniary externalities are not really externalities and should not be called such. However, when markets are incomplete or constrained, then \n\n  In economics, an externality is an indirect cost or benefit to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's (or parties') activity. Externalities can be considered as unpriced goods involved in either consumer or producer market transactions. A positive externality is when an individual's consumption in a market increases the well-being of others, \n\n A pecuniary externality occurs when the actions of an economic agent cause an increase or decrease in market prices. This is in contrast with technological or real externalities that have a direct resource effect on a third party. As with real externalities, pecuniary externalities can be either positive (favorable, as when consumers face a lower price) or negative (unfavorable, as when they face a higher price). Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause. Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality \n\n externalities are relevant for Pareto efficiency. This inefficiency is particularly relevant in financial economics. When some agents are subject to financial constraints, then changes in their net worth or collateral that result from pecuniary externalities may have first order welfare implications.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

Firms operating in a market of low product differentiation might not coordinate with others, which increases the incentive to cheat the collusion agreement. If price wars can be avoided, it will prove to be vital success for any business. While monopolies, for example, can be considered a market failure as prices rise and output falls, monopoly creation is not always a strict market phenomena. This may occur because of incentives facing voters, government officials, and government employees, because of actions by special interest groups that can impose costs on the general public, or because social goals other than economic efficiency are being pursued. Government granted monopolies comprise a fair portion of monopolized industries. There is a substantial body of research showing that under some circumstances price ceilings can, paradoxically, lead to higher prices. More precisely, firms forming a cartel becomes profitable by enabling nominally competing firms to act like a monopoly, limiting quantities and raising prices. However, forming a cartel is difficult because it is necessary to agree on quantities and prices, and because each firm will have an incentive to \"cheat\" by lowering prices to sell more than it agreed to. Such price points do not necessarily result from collusion, but as an emergent property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will most likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

The changes in total revenue are based on the price elasticity of demand, and there are general rules for them: The above movements along the demand curve result from changes in supply: Rational people and firms are assumed to make the most profitable decision, and total revenue helps firms to make these decisions because the profit that a firm can earn depends on the total revenue and the total cost. Such price points do not necessarily result from collusion, but as an emergent property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will most likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market). It is effective only when the firm is facing an inelastic demand curve. If the long run demand curve is elastic (as in the adjacent diagram), market equilibrium will be achieved by quantity changes rather than price changes. ; A price skimmer must be careful with the law. Price skimming can be considered either \n\n As a solution to the Bertrand paradox in economics, it has been suggested that each firm produces a somewhat differentiated product, and consequently faces a demand curve that is downward-sloping for all levels of the firm's price. An increase in a competitor's price is represented as an increase (for example, an upward shift) of the firm's demand curve. As a result, when a competitor raises price, generally a firm can also raise its own price and increase its profits.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

When workers are offered higher wages, they are more motivated and satisfied with their job, which can lead to increased productivity. Higher wages can also attract and retain skilled workers, reducing turnover and allowing for a more stable and experienced workforce. In the context of the supply chain network, increasing wages can help address labor shortages by making the job more attractive to potential workers. Furthermore, higher wages can incentivize workers to put in extra effort and be more committed to their work. For example, when workers are paid higher wages, they have more purchasing power, which can stimulate consumer demand for the products being supplied. However, it is important to consider the bounds on wage increases and conduct sensitivity analysis. While paying higher wages can have positive effects, there is a limit to the extent of wage increases that can be sustained by the firms in the supply chain network. In summary, increasing wages in the supply chain network can enhance labor productivity by motivating workers, attracting skilled employees, and reducing turnover. However, careful analysis of wage bounds is necessary to determine the sustainable range of wage increases. In other words, if the employee produces more, they should be paid accordingly. If pay lags behind productivity, income inequality grows, as labor's share of the output is falling, while capital's share (generally higher-income owners) is rising. BLS refers to this as the \"productivity-compensation gap\", an issue \n\nGlobalization: Income that might have gone to domestic workers is going to foreign workers due to offshoring (i.e., production and service activities in other countries). BLS explained the decline in labor share as likely driven by three factors that vary by industry:\n\nWage taxes can have a significant impact on the competition between firms for highly skilled CEOs in an international labor market. According to a study on the impact of taxes on competition for CEOs, it is shown that wage taxes can greatly influence the outcome of such a competition, especially when marginal tax rates differ across countries. If a country has higher wage tax rates compared to another country, it creates an imbalance in the attractiveness of job offers for highly skilled CEOs. However, the impact of increasing wage tax rates unilaterally can have an ambiguous effect on observed gross compensation levels. It means that while increasing wage taxes may reduce the net compensation for CEOs, it doesn't necessarily guarantee a proportional decrease in the gross compensation offered by firms. In a local labor market for CEOs, where tax rates are consistent within the same country, observed gross fixed salaries are expected to decline as the wage tax rate increases. Understanding the impact of tax differentials and incentives is essential for analyzing the dynamics of this competition and for designing effective compensation strategies for attracting top talent.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

However the low cost of mass amounts of unpainted plastic figures, the increasing cost of the price of metal and scares of the dangers of metal toys lead to the demise of the dimestore soldier. It has been increasingly replacing traditional materials like wood, concrete, and clay. To make PVC softer and more flexible, plasticizers are added to the material. The most widely used plasticizers for PVC are phthalates. However, advancements are being made to address these concerns through the development of alternative materials or improved production processes. Overall, PVC finds extensive use across different industries due to its properties as a thermoplastic polymer. Its ability to be made softer and more flexible with the addition of plasticizers further expands its range of applications in various products.

Suppose that the exchange rate between an \"apple\" country where consumers prefer apples, and an \"orange\" country where consumers prefer valuable oranges, is currently 1:1, but will change next year to 2:1 or 1:2 with equal probability. Suppose an apple consumer trades an apple to an orange consumer in exchange for an orange. The apple consumer now has given up an apple for an orange, which next year has an expected value of 1.25 apples. Thus both appear to have benefited from the exchange on average. The new equilibrium (with higher price and lower quantity than initial equilibrium) represents the price that consumers will pay for a given quantity of good extended by the part of the tax that producers will receive at given quantity. For example, if the initial price of the good is $2, and the tax levied on the production is $.40, consumers will be able to buy the good for $2.20, \n\n supply curve (red line, upward sloping) shows the quantity supplied depending positively on the price, while the demand curve (black lines, downward sloping) shows quantity depending negatively on the price and also on some additional variable Z, which affects the location of the demand curve in quantity-price space. With the quantities supplied and demanded being equal, the observations on quantity and price are the three white points in the graph: they reveal the supply curve. Hence the effect of Z on demand makes it possible to identify the (positive) slope of the \n\n  Competitive equilibrium is a state of balance between buyers and suppliers, in which the quantity demanded of a good is the quantity supplied at a specified price. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

Orange juice consumption has been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol levels. These flavonoids, along with other compounds present in orange juice, have also been shown to delay the development of mammary tumors in animal studies. It is important to note that while orange juice has potential health benefits, it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Excessive consumption of orange juice, due to its natural sugar content, can contribute to weight gain or difficulty in maintaining a healthy weight. Orange juice, because of its high acid levels, may bother you if you have ulcers or colitis. Therefore, you may want to drop orange juice from your diet. All fruits contain some acid, but citrus fruits fall on the very acidic side of the scale; oranges have a pH of about 2 to 3, making them potentially very irritating to someone with gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. Several orange juice manufacturers have developed versions of their products that are lower in acid, which might irritate ulcers and colitis less than the regular products. The fruits \n\n Economist Fischer Black gave the following illustration in 1995. Suppose that the exchange rate between an \"apple\" country where consumers prefer apples, and an \"orange\" country where consumers prefer valuable oranges, is currently 1:1, but will change next year to 2:1 or 1:2 with equal probability. Suppose an apple consumer trades an apple to an orange consumer in exchange for an orange. The apple consumer now has given up an apple for an orange, which next year has an expected value of 1.25 apples. The orange consumer now has given up an orange for an apple, which next year has an expected value of 1.25 oranges. Thus both appear to have benefited from the exchange on average. Mathematically, the apparent surplus is related to Jensen's inequality. Its initial operations included canning juice and grapefruit sections for its members, and in 1938 began extracting juice with automated machines. During World War II, the company produced concentrated orange juice for the military; after the war, 80% of the juice the company produced was in frozen concentrate form to meet consumer demand for the relatively new, convenient form. In the 1960s, consumer demand shifted to fresh-squeezed orange juice, and frozen concentrate sales declined while demand for chilled juices increased.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

It refers to machines, roads, factories, schools, infrastructure, and office buildings which humans have produced to create goods and services. ; Fixed capital — this includes machinery, factories, equipment, new technology, buildings, computers, and other goods that are designed to increase the productive potential of the economy for future years.

In Section 83, Turgot outlines the various ways that capital can be employed:  Although the various methods of employing capital have different returns, Turgot suggests that there is a relationship between these various uses of capital that influence the interest rate in the economy and return on these investments. Similarly, while financial economists use the word capital to refer to funds used by entrepreneurs and businesses to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services, macroeconomists and microeconomists use the term capital to mean productive equipment, buildings or other productive physical assets.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

In the context of cardinal utility, economists postulate a law of diminishing marginal utility, which describes how the first unit of consumption of a particular good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Thus, the construction company would spend an amount c×$1 i.e. $c. ; In round 2, the construction company incurs expenditure ($c) by procuring raw materials, say cement, steel, gravel, mortar, etc. from respective companies and thus, this amount $c becomes income for these companies.

A related government intervention, which is also a price control, is the price ceiling; it sets the maximum price that can legally be charged for a good or service, with a common example being rent control. Two common price floors are minimum wage laws and supply management in Canadian agriculture. Other price floors \n\n distinction between pecuniary and technological externalities was originally introduced by Jacob Viner, who did not use the term externalities explicitly but distinguished between economies (positive externalities) and diseconomies (negative externalities). For example, if someone buys whiskey and this raises the price of whiskey, the other consumers of whiskey will be worse off and the producers of whiskey will be better off. The presence of excess demand in one market influences effective demand or supply in another market, which may influence the degree of disequilibrium in the latter market; in turn, the constraints imposed on participants in that market influence their effective demand or supply in the former market. A pecuniary externality occurs when the actions of an economic agent cause an increase or decrease in market prices. This is in contrast with technological or real externalities that have a direct resource effect on a third party. For example, pollution from a factory directly harms the environment. As with real externalities, pecuniary externalities can be either positive (favorable, as when consumers face a lower price) or negative (unfavorable, as when they face a higher price).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school microeconomics.

There are three principal cost functions \n\n In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a metric that quantifies induced consumption, the concept that the increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. The short run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve. The long run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve. To find the shutdown point in the long run, first take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q. The marginal cost of public funds (MCF) is a concept in public finance which measures the loss incurred by society in raising additional revenues to finance government spending due to the distortion of resource allocation caused by taxation. The applications of the marginal cost of public funds include the Samuelson condition for the optimal provision of public goods and the optimal corrective taxation of externalities in public economic theory, the determination of tax-smoothing policy rules in normative public debt analysis and social cost-benefit analysis common in practical policy analysis. The rules are equivalent&mdash;if one divides both sides of inequality TR > VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P > AVC (price exceeds average variable cost). If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization (or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization).
