Beyond this \"critical mass\", they reignite and in some cases trigger a supernova explosion; this critical mass is often referred to as the Chandrasekhar mass, but is marginally different from the absolute Chandrasekhar limit, where electron degeneracy pressure is unable to prevent catastrophic collapse. If a white dwarf gradually accretes mass from a binary companion, or merges with a second \n\n Ia supernovae, it is unlikely that the same mechanism is at play for both. Binary systems of high-velocity stars, such as two white dwarfs or a white dwarf and a neutron star, that have been ejected from their galaxy either due to a neutron star kick or interaction with the supermassive black hole in their galaxy  could produce explosions when they eventually merge (due to gravitational wave radiation) that would preferentially occur far from galaxies. Type Ia supernovae, caused by a runaway nuclear fusion reaction in a white dwarf star, are thought to account for roughly one-third of all supernovae. SNEWS began operation prior to 2004, with three members \n\n SN 2010bj, a Type II-P supernova, was detected in February 2010, and SN 2015I, a Type Ia supernova was detected in May 2015. White dwarfs are the remnants of low-mass stars and, if they form a binary system with another star, they can cause large stellar explosions known as type Ia supernovae. The normal route by which this happens involves a white dwarf drawing material off a main sequence or red giant star to form an accretion disc. Much more rarely, a type Ia supernova occurs when two white dwarfs orbit each other closely. Because of this, runaway fusion reactions rapidly heat up the interior of the combined star and spread, causing a supernova explosion.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

The measurement of apparent magnitude is called \n\n apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in photometry over various wavelength bands. With the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). For comparison, Sirius has an absolute magnitude of only 1.4, which is still brighter than the Sun, whose absolute visual magnitude is 4.83. The Solar System and all of the visible stars are in different orbits about the core of the Milky Way galaxy. Thus, their relative positions change over time, and for the nearer stars this movement can be measured. As a star moves toward or away from us, its apparent brightness changes. Working out exactly which stars were or will be the \n\n  Apparent magnitude (m) is a measure of the brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from Earth.

On a sunny day, Rayleigh scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, where it is darkest around the zenith and bright near the horizon. Hence, fewer particles scatter the zenithal sunbeam, and thus the light remains a darker blue. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black. Other colors occur naturally in clouds. In the visible spectrum, blue and green are at the short end of light's visible wavelengths, while red and yellow are at the long end. The bluish color is evidence that such scattering is being produced by rain-sized droplets in \n\nThe blue appearance of the sun and moon on rare occasions, as well as the blue sunsets on Mars, can be explained by the selective extinction of light by atmospheric gas molecules and small aerosols. This is caused by the scattering and absorption of blue light by the Earth's atmosphere. However, on rare occasions, dust or smoke aerosols in the atmosphere can cause the extinction of red light to exceed that of blue light. This is because the dust particles in the Martian atmosphere primarily scatter blue light in a near-forward direction, resulting in the blue coloration of the sunset. This phenomenon cannot be solely explained by Rayleigh scattering, as observed on Earth. In summary, the blue appearance of the sun and moon on rare occasions is a result of the selective extinction of light, with blue light being scattered and absorbed differently by atmospheric particles. Similarly, the blue sunsets on Mars are caused by the scattering of blue light in the Martian atmosphere by dust aerosols. Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. On Mars, Rayleigh scattering is usually a very weak effect; the red color of the sky is caused by the presence of iron(III) oxide in the airborne dust particles.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

This work was furthered by ancient Indian and medieval Islamic physicists, before gaining great strides during the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, culminating in the formulation of Newton's law of gravity. Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner gravitas (heaviness). In the 6th century CE, Byzantine Alexandrian scholar John Philoponus modified the Aristotelian concept of gravity with the theory of impetus. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. - The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to emphasize how special relativity (and later general relativity) uses the principle of rela\n\n In mathematics and mathematical physics, potential theory is the study of harmonic functions. The term \"potential theory\" was coined in 19th-century physics when it was realized that two fundamental forces of nature known at the time, namely gravity and the electrostatic force, could be modeled using functions called the gravitational potential and electrostatic potential, both of which satisfy Poisson's equation—or in the vacuum, Laplace's equation. The difference is more one of emphasis than subject matter and rests on the following distinction: potential theory focuses on the properties of the functions as opposed to the properties of the equation. For example, a result about the singularities of harmonic functions would be said to belong \n\n Newton's classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a Euclidean geometry.) From a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other \n\n relativity (GR) he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

It is the only thick atmosphere of a natural satellite in the Solar System. Titan's lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (94.2%), methane (5.65%), and hydrogen (0.099%). Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only known moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt to the surface of the moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be \"as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea\". ; Titan, at 5,149 km diameter, is the second largest moon in the Solar System and Saturn's largest.

The flyby was able to show that the comet is 2.25 km long, and \"peanut shaped\". Some jets of material are being ejected from the dark side \n\n It was the first active comet observed to be orbiting a planet, and had probably been captured by Jupiter around 20–30 years earlier. The comet was later observed, as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 km in diameter. The prominent scars from the impacts were more easily visible than the Great Red Spot and persisted for many months. \"When warmed by the Sun, dry ice [frozen carbon dioxide] deep in the comet's body turns to gas jetting off the comet and dragging water ice with it.\" It is now believed that some of the dust, icy chunks, and other material coming off the ends of the comet are moving slowly enough to be captured by even the weak gravity of the comet. Observation by the Spitzer Space Telescope in August 2008 showed the comet nucleus to have a radius of 0.57 +/- and a low albedo of 0.028. The mass of the comet is estimated to be about 300 Mt. Barring a catastrophic breakup or major splitting event, the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700 years) at its current rate of mass loss. Radar observations by the Arecibo Observatory during the comet's 2010 apparition revealed that the nucleus is highly elongated and rotates over an 18-hour period. In 2011 Herschel Space Observatory detected the signature of vaporized water in the comet's coma.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

A study of dust storms with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter suggested that 10 percent of the water loss from Mars may have been caused by dust storms. Instruments on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected observed water vapor at very high altitudes during global dust storms. The most recent loss of atomic hydrogen from water was found to be largely driven by seasonal processes and dust storms that transport water directly to the upper atmosphere. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. The volume of water ice in the region were based on measurements from the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, called SHARAD. ,\n\nRecent findings about Martian water, methane, and organics have had a significant impact on the case for the existence of life on Mars. The Viking Labeled Release (LR) experiment conducted in 1976 yielded positive responses for extant microbial life on the Martian surface. Evidence suggests that liquid water existed on the Martian surface in the past and may still exist in the form of briny water today. In terms of methane, which is another important factor in the search for life, recent observations have detected the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere. The detection of methane on Mars has sparked interest and debate as to its origin, with one possibility being the existence of microbial life beneath the Martian surface. Furthermore, the discovery of organic compounds on Mars has also contributed to the discussion. It is important to note that the existence of water, methane, and organics on Mars does not confirm the presence of life conclusively. Overall, recent findings regarding Martian water, methane, and organics provide strong indications that life on Mars is a possibility. While the Viking LR experiment remains controversial and its results are debated, the presence of these key elements necessary for life increases the likelihood of extant or past life on Mars. Also, in some places dust is blown out of in geyser-like eruptions that are sometimes called \"spiders.\" It freezes out directly onto the surface of the permanent polar cap, which is made of water ice covered with layers of dust and sand. The deposit begins as a layer of dusty CO2 frost. By the time temperatures \n\n Much of the Martian surface is covered with a thick ice-rich, mantle layer that has fallen from the sky a number of times in the past. High levels of hydrogen (probably from water) have been found with Mars Odyssey.

This cracking of ice-rich ground is predicted based on physical processes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

At the time the first meteorite from the Moon was discovered in 1982, there was speculation that some other unusual meteorites that had been found previously originated from Mars. This would be very interesting because in this case stones from Earth older than 3.9 billion years, which are destroyed on Earth by various geological processes, may have survived on the Moon. Thus some scientists propose new missions to the Moon to search for ancient rocks from Earth. The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (Mercury and Venus), or only relatively tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids (Mars). The Moon is also the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, being 27% the size of Earth. The smaller moon may have remained in orbit for tens of millions of years. As the two moons migrated outward from Earth, solar tidal effects would have made the Lagrange orbit unstable, resulting in a slow-velocity collision that \"pancaked\" the smaller moon onto what is now the far side of the Moon, adding material to its crust. Lunar magma cannot pierce through the thick crust of the far side, causing fewer lunar maria, while the near side has a thin crust displaying the large maria visible from Earth. In many cases, on Earth, the impact crater has been destroyed by erosion, leaving only the deformed rock or sediment of the impact structure behind. This is the fate of almost all old impact craters on Earth, unlike the ancient pristine craters preserved on the Moon and other geologically inactive rocky bodies with old surfaces in the Solar System. Meteoroid collisions with solid Solar System objects, including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede, and most small moons and asteroids, create impact craters, which are the dominant geographic features of many of those objects. On other planets and moons with active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io, and Titan, visible impact craters may become eroded, buried, or transformed by tectonics over time.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

If Earth's orbit sends it through that trail of debris, which is composed mostly of fine grains of rocky material, there is likely to be a meteor shower as Earth passes through. Denser trails of debris produce quick but intense meteor showers and less dense trails create longer but less intense showers. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. The outburst was caused by Earth crossing the 1995 dust ejecta ; CAMS Texas and CAMS California detected an outburst of Perseids. This encounter with the dust trails or Filament of 109P/Swift-Tuttle was not anticipated 2020: ; 1) CAMS detected a new shower now called the gamma Piscis Austrinids ; 2) CAMS detected rho Phoenicids, a shower previously known only from radar observations. ; 2017: ; 1) On December 13, CAMS captured 3003 Geminids \n\n The brightest meteors known as bolides are long lasting fireballs that leave a trail in the sky which can be visible for up to an hour after passing.

Meteoroid sizes can be calculated from their mass and density which, in turn, can be estimated from the observed meteor trajectory in the upper atmosphere. Meteors may occur in showers, which arise when Earth passes through a stream of debris left by a comet, or as \"random\" or \"sporadic\" meteors, not associated with a specific stream of space debris.

At the same time, the ion or type I tail, made of gases, always points directly away from the Sun because this gas is more strongly affected by the solar wind than is dust, following magnetic field lines rather than an orbital trajectory. The ion tail is formed as a result of the ionization by solar ultra-violet radiation \n\n The observation of antitails contributed significantly to the discovery of solar wind. The ion tail is the result of ultraviolet radiation ejecting electrons off particles in the coma. Once the particles have been ionised, they form a plasma which in turn induces a magnetosphere around the comet. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called \"pick-up ions\") congregate and act to \"load\" the solar magnetic field with plasma. Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an \"induced magnetosphere\" around the comet. Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a bow shock is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind.

The close-up exploration would take place before the coma and tail begin to build, it would observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails. The tail of dust is left behind in the comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the antitail, only when it seems that it is directed towards the Sun. At the same time, the ion tail, made of gases, always points along the streamlines of the solar wind as it is strongly affected by the magnetic field of the plasma of the solar wind.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

The length that Eratosthenes intended for a 'stade' is not known, but his figure only has an error of around one to fifteen percent. Eratosthenes could only measure the circumference of Earth by assuming that the distance to the Sun is so great that the rays of sunlight are practically parallel. 1,700 years after Eratosthenes, Christopher Columbus studied Eratosthenes's findings before sailing west for the Indies.

It is also part of an area commonly known as the Bean Nebula. The evidence supporting the existence of the collective response and local wake caused by the gravitational interactions between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Milky Way comes from a study based on 1,301 stars at Galactocentric distances between 60 and 100 kiloparsecs. The location of the wake observed in the study is consistent with an N-body simulation that includes the dynamical effect of the LMC on the Milky Way halo. This detection of a strong local wake provides independent evidence that the Magellanic clouds, including the LMC, are on their first orbit around the Milky Way. These findings indicate that the outer halo of the Milky Way is not in dynamical equilibrium, challenging the assumption that is often made. PLCKESZ G286.6-31.3 is a galaxy cluster that is seen through the outer fringes of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it has 530 trillion times the Sun's mass, it can host up to 100 galaxies and hosts more than 700 star clusters inside the galaxy cluster, along with additions from hundreds to thousands of supergiant stars, and is invisible to the naked eye. In 2008, a team of astronomers found a match between the star's chemical composition and the characteristics of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Later observations using the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the star originated from the Milky Way's galactic center. NGC 1755 (also known as ESO 56-SC28) is an open star cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud in the Dorado constellation, It is about 120 light years across and due to its size could be a globular cluster.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

In 2012, The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has found that the permanently shadowed regions have a porous, powdery surface, that indicates the presence of water ice. Mars has ice caps at its north pole and south pole, which consist mainly of water ice; however, there is frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) present on their surfaces. Dry ice accumulates in the north polar region (Planum Boreum) in winter only, subliming completely in summer, while the south polar region additionally has a permanent dry ice cover up to eight meters (25 feet) thick. This approach is similar to what NASA is doing at the Moon under the Artemis program – sending astronauts to lunar South Pole, where ice is trapped in the permanently shadowed regions of the pole. Such explorers may one day core, sample, and analyze the ice to better understand the \n\n Vonnegut is a crater on Mercury, near the north pole. The crater was referred to as e5 in scientific literature prior to naming. S band radar data from the Arecibo Observatory collected between 1999 and 2005 indicates a radar-bright area along the southern interior of Vonnegut, which is probably indicative of a water ice deposit, and lies within the permanently shadowed part of the crater. MESSENGERs Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) was used to measure surface reflectance of the surface of the planet, and the radar-bright material is covered by low-reflectance material.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from \n\n Voids are affected by the way gravity causes matter in the universe to \"clump together\", herding galaxies into clusters and chains, which are separated by regions mostly devoid of galaxies, yet the exact mechanisms are subject to scientific debate. The bigger and emptier the void, the weaker its gravity, and \n\n NeVe 1's location in the sky behind the plane of the Milky Way makes it very difficult to study in the optical wavelengths. Observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2010 revealed that NeVe 1 sits at the center of a comet-like structure of its host cluster, indicative of ram-pressure stripping and the merger of at least two smaller subclusters. This enormous structure may have slowed down the velocity of NeVe 1 via the interaction of its stars and dark matter. The head of the structure sits about 4 kiloparsecs (13,000 light-years) from NeVe 1 and the galaxy itself is classified as a cooling core with high X-ray emission in contrast to the hot, intracluster medium of the Ophiuchus Cluster.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.
