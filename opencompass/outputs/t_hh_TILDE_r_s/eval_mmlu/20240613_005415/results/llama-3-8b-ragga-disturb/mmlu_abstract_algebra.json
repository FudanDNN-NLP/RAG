If d < 0, then the class number of Q(√d) is equal to 1 if and only if In number theory, the Baker–Heegner–Stark theorem states precisely which quadratic imaginary number fields admit unique factorisation in their ring of integers.

The class number of Q(√d) is the number of equivalence \n\n In abstract algebra, a field extension L/K is called algebraic if every element of L is algebraic over K, i.e. For example, the field extension R/Q, that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers, is transcendental, while the field extensions C/R and Q(√2)/Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers. Let E \n\n an extension field of K, and a ∈ E. If a is algebraic over K, then K(a), the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K, is not only a ring but a field: K(a) is an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K. The converse is not true. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice. An extension L/K is algebraic if and only if every sub K-algebra of L is a field.

However, while this is true for third degree polynomials (cubics) and fourth degree polynomials (quartics), the Abel–Ruffini theorem (1824) shows that this is not true in general when the degree is 5 or greater. quintic equation)\n\n Let Fq = GF(q) be the finite field of characteristic p, that is, the field having q elements where q = pe for some prime p. A polynomial f with coefficients in Fq (symbolically written as f ∈ Fq[x] ) is a permutation polynomial of Fq if the function from Fq to itself defined by, the reduction of f(x)t mod (xq − x) has degree ≤ q − 2 . If f(x) is a permutation polynomial defined over the finite field GF(q) , then so is g(x) = a f(x + b) + c for all a ≠ 0, b and c in GF(q) . The permutation polynomial g(x) is in normalized form if a, b and c are chosen so that g(x) is monic, g(0) = 0 and (provided the characteristic p does not divide the degree n of the polynomial) the coefficient of xn&minus;1 is 0. As mentioned above, it suffices to check the statement \"every non-constant polynomial p(z) with real coefficients has a complex root\".

More precisely, the following conditions are equivalent:\n\n Given a group G, a subgroup H ≤ G, and a set X, we say a function f : G → X hides the subgroup H if for all g1, g2 ∈ G, f(g1) = f(g2) if and only if g1H = g2H. Equivalently, the function f is constant on the cosets of H, while it is different between the different cosets of H. Hidden subgroup problem: Let G be a group, X a finite set, and f : G → X a function that hides a subgroup H ≤ G. The function f is given via an oracle, which uses O(log |G|+log|X|) bits. Using information gained from evaluations of f via its oracle, determine a generating set for H. A special case is when X is a group and f is a group homomorphism in which case H corresponds to the kernel of f.\n\n If A is a subgroup of G and B is a subgroup of H , then the direct product A × B is a subgroup of G × H . Given a group G and a subgroup H, and an element a ∈ G, one can consider the corresponding left coset: aH := { ah : h ∈ H }. Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group G of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup H of even integers. For a general subgroup H, it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { aH : a ∈ G }. A subgroup N of a group G is normal if and only if the coset equality aN = Na holds for all a ∈ G. A normal subgroup of G is denoted N ◁ G.\n\n As mentioned above, the subgroups G and H are normal in G × H . Then πG and πH are homomorphisms, known as projection homomorphisms, whose kernels are H and G , respectively. In the case where G × H is a finite group, it follows that the composition factors of G × H are precisely the union of the composition factors of G and the composition factors of H .\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra.

For this presentation a typical polynomial is expressed as: The field Zq has its representative elements in the set { -(q-1)/2, ...-1, 0, 1, ... (q-1)/2 }. When n is a power of 2, the polynomial Φ(x) will be the cyclotomic polynomial xn + 1. the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the Abel–Ruffini theorem: f(X) = X5 − 4X + 2 (and E = Q ), f(X) = Xn + an−1Xn−1 + ⋯ + a0 (where f is regarded as a polynomial in E(a0, ..., an−1) , for some indeterminates ai , E is any field, and n ≥ 5 ). For example, a finite extension F / E of degree n is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of F -algebras F ⊗E F ≅ Fn .This fact is the beginning of Grothendieck's Galois theory, a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra.

But the order of G is only 30, so a simple group of order \n\n order n, gn is the identity element for any element g. This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since kn ≡ 0 (mod n) for every integer k. (This is also true for a general group of order n, due to Lagrange's theorem.)

If d is a \n\n  For any element g in any group G, one can form a subgroup of all integer powers ⟨g⟩ = {gk | k ∈ Z}, called a cyclic subgroup of g. The order of g is the number of elements in ⟨g⟩; that is, the order of an element is equal to the order of its cyclic subgroup. A cyclic group is a group which is equal to one of its cyclic subgroups: G = ⟨g⟩ for some element g, called a generator.

If G is a finite group in which, for each n > 0, G contains at most n elements of order dividing n, then G must be cyclic. The theory of finite groups is the set of first-order statements in the language of groups that are true in all finite groups (there are plenty of infinite models of this theory).

Specifically, the image of G under a homomorphism φ: G → H is isomorphic to G / ker(φ) where ker(φ) denotes the kernel of φ. In category theory, quotient groups are examples of quotient objects, which are dual to subobjects. Equivalently, the function f is constant on the cosets of H, while it is different between the different cosets of H. Hidden subgroup problem: Let G be a group, X a finite set, and f : G → X a function that hides a subgroup H ≤ G. The function f is given via an oracle, which uses O(log |G|+log|X|) bits. If K is a subset of ker(f) then there exists a unique homomorphism h: G/K → H such that. In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on G that map K to the identity element. Therefore, by setting we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem. We can write the statement of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms of groups as \"every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a quotient group\". 1) Any group G is the homomorphic image of some free group F(S). Let S be a set of generators of G. The natural map f: F(S) → G is an epimorphism, which proves the claim.

The kernel of σ is an ideal of E which cannot be the whole field E, because of the condition σ(1) = 1. An associative algebra amounts to a ring homomorphism whose image lies in the center. Indeed, starting with a ring A and a ring homomorphism. See also: generic matrix ring. A ring homomorphism : A function f : R → S between rings (R, +, ∗) and (S, ⊕, ×) is a ring homomorphism if it satisfies ring isomorphism : A ring homomorphism that is bijective is a ring isomorphism. The inverse of a ring isomorphism is also a ring isomorphism. Two rings are isomorphic if there exists a ring isomorphism between them. Let P be the set consisting of all (two-sided) ideals in R except R itself. The ideal R was excluded because maximal ideals by definition are not equal to R.

Let E \n\n By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there exists a subextension L of K/R such that Gal(K/L) = H. As [L:R] = [G:H] is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have L = R, thus [K:R] and [K:C] are powers of 2. However, C has no extension of degree 2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extension. If F has no proper algebraic extension, let p(x) be some irreducible polynomial in F[x]. Then the quotient of F[x] modulo the ideal generated by p(x) is an algebraic extension of F whose degree is equal to the degree of p(x).
