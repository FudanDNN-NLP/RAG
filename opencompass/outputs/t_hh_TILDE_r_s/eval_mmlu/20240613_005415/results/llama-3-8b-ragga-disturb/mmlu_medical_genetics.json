On the other hand, Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes become attached together, resulting in the fusion of one part of each chromosome. Reciprocal translocations are usually harmless and can be detected through prenatal diagnosis. It is important to note that most carriers of balanced translocations are healthy and do not experience any symptoms. Robertsonian translocations, on the other hand, involve the fusion of two chromosomes. A gene fusion may result from this translocation, joining two separate genes. Robertsonian translocations are also detected through cytogenetics or a karyotype of affected cells. It is crucial to differentiate between chromosomal translocations that occur during gametogenesis (errors in meiosis) and those that happen in cellular division of somatic cells (errors in mitosis). Translocations in gametogenesis result in a chromosomal abnormality present in all cells of the offspring, such as translocation carriers. Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes get attached, meaning that given two healthy pairs of chromosomes, one of each pair \"sticks\" and blends together homogeneously. Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes get attached, meaning that given two healthy pairs of chromosomes, one of each pair \"sticks\" and blends together homogeneously. A gene fusion may be created when the translocation joins two otherwise-separated genes. Translocations can be balanced (in an even exchange of material with no genetic information extra or missing, and ideally full functionality) or unbalanced (where the exchange of chromosome material is unequal resulting in extra or missing genes). Reciprocal translocations\nReciprocal translocations are usually an exchange of material between non-homologous chromosomes and occur in about 1 in 491 live births. Such translocations are usually harmless and may be found through prenatal diagnosis. It is important to distinguish between chromosomal translocations occurring in gametogenesis, due to errors in meiosis, and translocations that occur in cellular division of somatic cells, due to errors in mitosis. The former results in a chromosomal abnormality featured in all cells of the offspring, as in translocation carriers. Somatic translocations, on the other hand, result in abnormalities featured only in the affected cell line, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Robertsonian translocations\nRobertsonian translocation is a type of translocation caused by breaks at or near the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes. The most common translocation in humans involves chromosomes 13 and 14 and is seen in about 0.97 / 1000 newborns. Carriers of Robertsonian translocations are not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but there is a risk of unbalanced gametes that lead to miscarriages or abnormal offspring. For example, carriers of Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 21 have a higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome. Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 14 also carry a slight risk of uniparental disomy 14 due to trisomy rescue. Role in disease\nSome human diseases caused by translocations are:\n Cancer: Several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations (as opposed to those present from conception); this has been described mainly in leukemia (acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia). of Robertsonian translocations are generally not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but do have an increased risk of generating meiotically unbalanced.

On the other hand, Robertsonian translocation involves the attachment of two non-homologous chromosomes, where one pair \"sticks\" and blends together homogeneously. This type of translocation can be detected through cytogenetics or a karyotype analysis of affected cells. In contrast, Robertsonian translocation does not involve the exchange of genetic material between chromosomes but rather the fusion of two entire chromosomes. This type of translocation typically occurs between acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes with centromeres located near one end) and may result in no extra or missing genetic information if it is balanced.

Since females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), the inheritance of X-linked recessive diseases differs between males and females. For males, since they only have one X chromosome, if they inherit the mutated gene, they will develop the disease because they do not have another normal copy of the gene to compensate. Thus, if a male inherits the mutated gene from his carrier mother, he will be affected by the disease. If a carrier female passes on her mutated X chromosome to her offspring (regardless of the child's sex), there is a 50% chance that her son will inherit the mutated gene and be affected by the disease. To summarize, the inheritance pattern of an X-linked recessive disease involves a 50% chance of a male being affected if the female parent is a carrier, while females can be carriers themselves but are generally not affected by the disease due to the presence of a second X chromosome. However, if an infant or child has only one copy, he or she are a carrier of the mutation. If both parents are carriers of the recessive gene mutation, each child have a 25% chance of inheriting the gene. ; X-linked: When a trait or disease happens in a person who has inherited a mutated gene on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosome). Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected while daughters who inherit the mutation are carriers. Therefore, with each pregnancy, a carrier female has a 25% chance of having a male that is affected, a 25% chance of having a female that is a carrier, and a 50% chance of having a normal male or female. However, if a male with a less severe phenotype reproduces, all of his daughters are carriers, and none of his sons will be affected. A number of genetic disorders are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are hemizygous), they are more frequent in males than in females.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.

Specifically, they are formed between the nitrogenous bases cytosine (C) and guanine (G). These nitrogenous bases are two of the four bases found in the DNA and RNA molecules, with the other two being adenine (A) and thymine (T) in DNA, and adenine (A) and uracil (U) in RNA. In the case of DNA, the base pairing pattern follows the Watson-Crick model, where adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G) through three hydrogen bonds. The relationship between base pairs in a DNA molecule is crucial for understanding the structure and function of DNA. The base pairs in DNA consist of four different nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The base pairs in DNA adhere to a specific pattern referred to as the Watson-Crick base pairing rules. These rules dictate that adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C). This pairing is based on hydrogen bonding, where adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds, and guanine and cytosine form three hydrogen bonds. This notation signifies that adenine and thymine are complementary to each other, meaning they always pair up, and guanine and cytosine are also complementary and form base pairs together. This arrangement of base pairs creates a double-helix structure in DNA, where the two strands are held together by the hydrogen bonds formed between the complementary bases. In summary, the relationship between base pairs in a DNA molecule is a complementary pairing, with adenine (A) always pairing with thymine (T) and guanine (G) always pairing with cytosine (C). The answer is D.\n\nThe relationship between base pairs in a DNA molecule is crucial for understanding the structure and function of DNA.

A causative mutated allele, ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RyR1) at nucleotide C7360G, generating a R2454G amino acid substitution. has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry, inherited as an autosomal dominant It can be caused by overwork, anesthesia, or stress. ; Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal Asthenia (HERDA), also known as hyperelastosis cutis (HC). This is caused by an autosomal recessive gene, and thus, unlike HYPP, HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a type of severe reaction that occurs in response to particular medications used during general anesthesia, among those who are susceptible. Symptoms include muscle rigidity, high fever, and a fast heart rate. Susceptibility can occur due to at least six genetic mutations, with the most common one being of the RYR1 gene. These genetic variations are often inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner. The condition may also occur as a new mutation or be associated with a number of inherited muscle diseases, such as central core disease. Family members may be tested to see if they are susceptible by muscle biopsy or genetic testing. While cases that appear similar to MH have been documented since the early 20th century, the condition was only formally recognized in 1960. Signs and symptoms\nThe typical signs of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hypercatabolic state, which presents as a very high temperature, an increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis. Causes\nMalignant hyperthermia is a disorder that can be considered a gene–environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. In fact, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), predisposed by mutations in the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1), is one of the most severe heat-related illnesses. The MHS-associated heat susceptibilities predominantly affect children and metabolically active young adults, often leading to life- threatening hypermetabolic responses to heat. Other anesthetic drugs do not trigger malignant hyperthermia. The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants pancuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium, vecuronium and rocuronium also do not cause MH. There is mounting evidence that some individuals with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility may develop MH with exercise and/or on exposure to hot environments. Genetics\nMalignant hyperthermia's inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. The defect is typically located on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.2) involving the ryanodine receptor. More than 25 different mutations in this gene are linked with malignant hyperthermia. These mutations tend to cluster in one of three domains within the protein, designated MH1-3. It has also been postulated that MH and central core disease may be allelic and thus can be co-inherited. Pathophysiology\n\nDisease mechanism\nIn a large proportion (50–70%) of cases, the propensity for malignant hyperthermia is due to a mutation of the ryanodine receptor (type 1), located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the organelle within skeletal muscle cells that stores calcium. RYR1 opens in response to increases in intracellular  level mediated by L-type calcium channels, thereby resulting in a drastic increase in intracellular calcium levels and muscle contraction. Caffeine, halothane, and other triggering agents act by drastically increasing the affinity of the A-site for  and concomitantly decreasing the affinity of the I-site in mutant proteins. The process of sequestering this excess  consumes large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main cellular energy carrier, and generates the excessive heat (hyperthermia) that is the hallmark of the disease. The other known causative gene for MH is CACNA1S, which encodes an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel α-subunit. When these mutant channels are expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293)  cells, the resulting channels are five times more sensitive to activation by caffeine (and presumably halothane) and activate at 5–10mV more hyperpolarized. As these channels interact with and activate RYR1, these alterations result in a drastic increase of intracellular , and, thereby, muscle excitability. Animal model\nResearch into malignant hyperthermia was limited until the discovery of \"porcine stress syndrome\" (PSS) in Danish Landrace and other pig breeds selected for muscling, a condition in which stressed pigs develop \"pale, soft, exudative\" flesh (a manifestation of the effects of malignant hyperthermia) rendering their meat less marketable at slaughter. Horses also suffer from malignant hyperthermia. A causative mutated allele, ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RyR1) at nucleotide C7360G, generating a R2454G amino acid substitution. has been identified in the American Quarter Horse and breeds with Quarter Horse ancestry, inherited as an autosomal dominant. These mice display signs similar to human MH patients, including sensitivity to halothane (increased respiration, body temperature, and death). Blockade of RYR1 by dantrolene prevents adverse reaction to halothane in these mice, as with humans. Despite the name, elevation of body temperature is often a late sign, but may appear early in severe cases. Malignant hyperthermia is diagnosed on clinical grounds, but various laboratory investigations may prove confirmatory. Susceptibility testing\n\nMuscle testing\nThe main candidates for testing are those with a close relative who has suffered an episode of MH or have been shown to be susceptible. The standard procedure is the \"caffeine-halothane contracture test\", CHCT. The fresh biopsy is bathed in solutions containing caffeine or halothane and observed for contraction; under good conditions, the sensitivity is 97% and the specificity 78%. Intramuscular injection of halothane 6 vol% has been shown to result in higher than normal increases in local  among patients with known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Genetic testing\nGenetic testing is being performed in a limited fashion to determine susceptibility to MH. In people with a family history of MH, analysis for RYR1 mutations may be useful. The higher the score (above 6), the more likely a reaction constituted MH:\n Respiratory acidosis (end-tidal  above 55 mmHg/7.32 kPa or arterial  above 60 mmHg/7.98 kPa)\n Heart involvement (unexplained sinus tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)\n Metabolic acidosis (base excess lower than -8, pH <7.25)\n Muscle rigidity (generalized rigidity including severe masseter muscle rigidity)\n Muscle breakdown (CK >20,000/L units, cola colored urine or excess myoglobin in urine or serum, potassium above 6 mmol/l)\n Temperature increase (rapidly increasing temperature, T >38.8 °C)\n Other (rapid reversal of MH signs with dantrolene, elevated resting serum CK levels)\n Family history (autosomal dominant pattern)\n\nPrevention\nIn the past, the prophylactic use of dantrolene was recommended for MH-susceptible patients undergoing general anesthesia. Only five of these patients exhibited signs consistent with MH, four of which were treated successfully with parenteral dantrolene, and the remaining one recovered with only symptomatic therapy. After weighing its questionable benefits against its possible adverse effects (including nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and prolonged duration of action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents), experts no longer recommend the use of prophylactic dantrolene prior to trigger-free general anesthesia in MH-susceptible patients. These filters prevent residual anesthetic from triggering malignant hyperthermia for up to 12 hours, even at low fresh gas flows. Treatment\n\nThe current treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of dantrolene, the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia. After the widespread introduction of treatment with dantrolene, the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80% in the 1960s to less than 5%. Prognosis\nPrognosis is poor if this condition is not aggressively treated. History\nThe syndrome was first recognized in Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia in an affected family by Denborough et al. In 1981, the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS) hotline was established to provide telephone support to clinical teams treating patients with suspected malignant hyperthermia. Other animals\nOther animals, including certain pig breeds, dogs, and horses, are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. In dogs its inheritance is autosomal dominant. The syndrome has been reported in  Pointers, Greyhounds, Labrador Retrievers, Saint Bernards, Springer Spaniels, Bichon Frises, Golden Retrievers, and Border Collies. In horses its inheritance is autosomal dominant, and most associated with the American Quarter Horse although it can occur in other breeds. Research\nAzumolene is a 30-fold more water-soluble analog of dantrolene that also works to decrease the release of intracellular calcium by its action on the ryanodine receptor.

The presentation of HMSN-P is quite similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and has common neuropathological findings. Two large families in Japan have been identified with the disease locus to chromosome 3q. Through clinical studies, researchers identified that TFG mutations on chromosome 3q13.2 causes HMSN-P. \"The presence of TFG/ubiquitin- and/or TDP-43-immunopositive cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons and cytosolic aggregation composed of TDP-43 in cultured cells expressing mutant TFG indicate a novel pathway of motor neuron death\"\n\nMalignant hyperthermia (MH) is indeed a genetic disorder characterized by a hypermetabolic response in skeletal muscle. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to develop the condition. However, with prompt recognition and appropriate management, the prognosis is generally good. The underlying cause of MH is a mutation in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene. The specific mutation in the RYR1 gene leads to an abnormal release of calcium, which triggers an excessive release of calcium from the muscle's storage compartments. This dysregulation results in the hypermetabolic response seen in MH. Diagnosis of MH typically involves a combination of clinical signs and specific diagnostic testing, such as the caffeine-halothane contracture test or genetic testing to identify the RYR1 mutation. In conclusion, malignant hyperthermia is a genetically inherited disorder characterized by hypermetabolism in skeletal muscle. Understanding the underlying genetic mutation and avoiding triggering factors is crucial for the proper management and prevention of MH episodes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.

Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma, especially in the case of parental incest. The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males. For instance, they may have behavioral problems and might be antisocial. The stress that the mother experiences affects the fetus and the fetus' growth which can include the fetus' nervous system (Reilly, 2017). Stress can also lead to low birth weight. Similar to stress, Reilly stated that in recent studies, researchers have found that pregnant women who show depressive symptoms are not as attached and bonded to their child while it is in the womb (2017). Childhood trauma is often described as serious adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Children may go through a range of experiences that classify as psychological trauma; these might include neglect, abandonment, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and physical abuse, witnessing abuse of a sibling or parent, or having a mentally ill parent. These events have profound psychological, physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being such as unsocial behaviors, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and sleep disturbances. Similarly, children with mothers who have experienced traumatic or stressful events during pregnancy can increase the child's risk of mental health disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998 study on adverse childhood experiences determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy self-destructive behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises. Health \n\nTraumatic experiences during childhood causes stress that increases an individual's allostatic load and thus affects the immune system, nervous system, and endocrine system. Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes including depression, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, and premature mortality. Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior. Recent research has found that physical and sexual abuse are associated with mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood, while personality disorders and schizophrenia are linked with emotional abuse as adults. In addition, research has proposed that mental health outcomes from childhood trauma may be better understood through a dimensional framework (internalizing and externalizing) as opposed to specific disorders. Psychological impact\n\nChildhood trauma can increase the risk of mental disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attachment issues, depression, and substance abuse. Sensitive and critical stages of child development can result in altered neurological functioning, adaptive to a malevolent environment but difficult for more benign environments. The conclusion of the study shows that there is a correlation between the effects of childhood trauma and the being at high risk for psychosis. Survivors of childhood trauma are also at higher risk of developing asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes or having a stroke. Epigenetics \n\nChildhood trauma can leave epigenetic marks on a child's genes, which chemically modify gene expression by silencing or activating genes. Another recent study in rhesus macaques showed that DNA methylation changes related to early-life adversity persisted into adulthood. Survivors of war trauma or childhood maltreatment are at increased risk for trauma-spectrum disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Traumatic experiences might even affect psychological as well as biological parameters in the next generation, i.e. traumatic stress might have trans generational effects. Parental trauma exposure was found to be associated with greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood and anxiety disorders in offspring since biological alterations associated with PTSD and/or other stress-related disorders have also been observed in offspring of trauma survivors who do not themselves report trauma exposure or psychiatric disorder. Animal models have demonstrated that stress exposure can result in epigenetic alterations in the next generation, and such mechanisms have been hypothesized to underpin vulnerability to symptoms in offspring of trauma survivors. Enduring behavioral responses to stress and epigenetic alterations in adult offspring have been demonstrated to be mediated by changes in gametes in utero effects, variations in early postnatal care, and/or other early life experiences that are influenced by parental exposure (Yehuda, Daskalakis, Bierer, Bader, Klengel, Holsboer, and Binder, 2015). Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline. Socioeconomic costs \nThe social and economic costs of child abuse and neglect are difficult to calculate. Transgenerational effects\n\nPeople can pass their epigenetic marks including de-myelinated neurons to their children. This is known as transgenerational trauma or intergenerational trauma, and can manifest in parenting behaviors as well as epigenetically. Exposure to childhood trauma, along with environmental stress, can also cause alterations in genes and gene expressions. A growing body of literature suggests that children's experiences of trauma and abuse within close relationships not only jeopardize their well-being in childhood, but can also have long-lasting consequences that extend well into adulthood. These long-lasting consequences can include emotion regulation issues, which can then be passed onto subsequent generations through child-parent interactions and learned behaviors. (see also behavioral epigenetics, epigenetics, historical trauma, and cycle of violence)\n\nResilience\n\nExposure to maltreatment in childhood significantly predicts a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood. Therefore, there are factors that reduce the impact of potentially traumatic events and protect an individual from developing mental health problems after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Research regarding children who showed adaptive development while facing adversity began in the 1970s and continues to this day. Furthermore, that same individual may recover more quickly and successfully from a potentially traumatic experience than an individual who could be said to be less resilient. In children, level of functioning is operationalized as the child continuing to behave in a manner that is considered developmentally appropriate for a child of that age. One factor that does not affect resilience is gender, with both males and females being equally sensitive to risk and protective factors. Attachment has been shown to be one of the most important factors to consider when it comes to evaluating the relative resilience of an individual. Children with secure attachments to an adult with effective coping strategies were most likely to endure adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in an adaptive manner. Secure attachment to one's peers throughout adolescence is a particularly strong predictor of resilience. Within the context of abuse, it is thought that these secure attachments decrease the extent to which children who are abused perceive others as being untrustworthy. In other words, while some children who are abused might begin to view other people as being unsafe and unable to be trusted, children who are able to develop and maintain healthy relationships are less likely to hold these views. Children who experience trauma but also experience healthy attachment with multiple groups of people (in essence, adults, peers, romantic partners, etc.) throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are particularly resilient. Personality also affects the development (or lack of development) of adult psychopathology as a result of childhood abuse. Furthermore, individuals with higher scores on openness to experience, conscientiousness, and extraversion have been found to be more resilient to the effects of childhood trauma. Successful adaptation, or resilience, is quite common among children. This is due in part to the naturally adaptive nature of childhood development. Therefore, resilience is enhanced by protecting against factors that might undermine a child's inborn resilience. Therefore, interventions that promote strong parent-child bonds are particularly effective at buffering against the potential negative effects of trauma. Furthermore, researchers of resilience argue that successful adaptation is not merely an end result but rather a developmental process that is ongoing throughout a person's lifetime. Prognosis\nTrauma affects all children differently (see stress in early childhood). Types of trauma\n\nBullying \nBullying is any unprovoked action with the intention of harming, either physically or psychologically, someone who is considered to have less power, either physically or socially. For example, cognitive complications (dissociation), affective, somatic, behavioral, relational, and self-attributional problems have been seen in individuals who have experienced complex trauma. Exposure to natural disaster constitutes a risk factor for poor psychological health in children and adolescents. Outcomes for children include psychological distress, behavioral disorders, disturbances in self-regulation, difficulties with social interaction, and disorganized attachment. Younger children are completely dependent on their caregivers than older children not only for physical care but also emotional care. This is needed for them to develop normal neurological, psychological, and social development. This dependence can contribute to their vulnerability to witnessing violence against their caregivers. Children may experience disruptions in their attachment with their caregivers due to their traumatic medical experience. For example, a young child may feel betrayed by their parents if they have had to participate in activities that have cause and contributed to the child's pain such as administering medications or taking them to the doctor. At the same time, the parent-child relationship is strained due to parents feeling powerless, guilt, or inadequacy. Refugee trauma \nRefugee-related childhood trauma can take place in the child's country of origin due to war, persecution, or violence, but can also be a result of the process of displacement or even the disruptions and transitions of resettlement into the destination country. Some outcomes from experiencing trauma in refugee children are behavioral problems, mood and anxiety disorders, PTSD, and adjustment difficulty. Separation trauma \nSeparation trauma is a disruption in an attachment relationship that disrupts neurological development and can lead to death. Theoretically grounded in attachment, trauma, and developmental theories and specifically addresses three core domains impacted by exposure to chronic, interpersonal trauma: attachment, self-regulation, and developmental competencies.

One of the most significant risks is the potential for mental retardation. Phenylketonuria is an inherited disorder that affects the body's ability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. When a pregnant woman with PKU doesn't manage her condition properly, high levels of phenylalanine in her blood can cross the placenta and negatively impact the developing fetus. The severity of mental retardation can vary from mild to severe, depending on the level of phenylalanine and the duration of exposure during pregnancy. It is crucial for women with PKU who are planning to become pregnant, or are already pregnant, to strictly adhere to a low-phenylalanine diet. In addition to mental retardation, there are other potential health risks associated with children born to mothers with PKU. These may include developmental delays, growth abnormalities, microcephaly (a smaller head size), congenital heart defects, and behavioral problems. Each case is unique, and the severity of these risks can vary, depending on several factors such as the mother's phenylalanine level control and the duration of exposure during pregnancy. Regular prenatal care and ongoing monitoring are essential to reduce the risks associated with PKU and optimize the health outcomes for both the mother and the child. Untreated, PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Phenylketonuria is a genetic disorder inherited from a person's parents. It is due to mutations in the PAH gene, which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms. Treatment is with a diet that (1) is low in foods that contain phenylalanine, and which (2) includes special supplements. Effectiveness is monitored through periodic blood tests. The medication sapropterin dihydrochloride may be useful in some. Phenylketonuria affects about 1 in 12,000 babies. Signs and symptoms\n\nUntreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight. Because the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick, typically performed 2–7 days after birth. This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding. If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. The disease may present clinically with seizures,  hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a \"musty odor\" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed. Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. It is critical to control the diet of infants with PKU very carefully so that the brain has an opportunity to develop normally. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability (though such clinical disorders are still possible including asthma, eczema, anemia, weight gain, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, gastritis, esophagus and kidney deficiencies, kidney stones, and hypertension). In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good. Treated people may have no detectable physical, neurological, or developmental problems at all. If both parents are carriers for PKU, there is a 25% chance any child they have will be born with the disorder, a 50% chance the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance the child will neither develop nor be a carrier for the disease. PKU is characterized by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), rendering it nonfunctional. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr). Carriers of a single PKU allele do not exhibit symptoms of the disease but  appear to be protected to some extent against the fungal toxin ochratoxin A. Pathophysiology\nWhen phenylalanine (Phe) cannot be metabolized by the body, a typical diet that would be healthy for people without PKU causes abnormally high levels of Phe to accumulate in the blood, which is toxic to the brain. If left untreated (and often even in treatment), complications of PKU include severe intellectual disability, brain function abnormalities, microcephaly, mood disorders, irregular motor functioning, and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as physical symptoms such as a \"musty\" odor, eczema, and unusually light skin and hair coloration. Classical PKU\nClassical PKU, and its less severe forms \"mild PKU\" and \"mild hyperphenylalaninemia\" are caused by a mutated gene for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which converts the amino acid phenylalanine (\"Phe\") to other essential compounds in the body, in particular tyrosine. Tyrosine is a conditionally essential amino acid for PKU patients because without PAH it cannot be produced in the body through the breakdown of phenylalanine. Compared to classic PKU patients, patients with \"hyperphe\" have greater PAH enzyme activity and are able to tolerate larger amounts of phenylalanine in their diets. Excessive levels of phenylalanine tend to decrease the levels of other LNAAs in the brain. Classic PKU affects myelination and white matter tracts in untreated infants; this may be one major cause of neurological problems associated with phenylketonuria. Those who suffer from this form of hyperphenylalaninemia may have a deficiency of tyrosine (which is created from phenylalanine by PAH), in which case treatment is supplementation of tyrosine to account for this deficiency. Levels of dopamine can be used to distinguish between these two types. Metabolic pathways\n\nThe enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. If this reaction does not take place, phenylalanine accumulates and tyrosine is deficient. Elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and detection of phenylketones in the urine is diagnostic, however most patients are diagnosed via newborn screening. Treatment\nPKU is not curable. However, if PKU is diagnosed early enough, an affected newborn can grow up with normal brain development by managing and controlling phenylalanine (\"Phe\") levels through diet, or a combination of diet and medication. People must adhere to a special diet low in Phe for optimal brain development. For people who do not have phenylketonuria, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set recommended at least 33 mg/kg body weight/day phenylalanine plus tyrosine for adults 19 years and older. For people with PKU, a recommendation for children up to age 10 years is 200 to 500 mg/d; for older children and adults below 600  mg/day . Lower-protein \"medical food\" substitutes are often used in place of normal bread, pasta, and other grain-based foods, which contain a significant amount of Phe. A diet that is low in phenylalanine but does not include protein substitutes may also fail to lower blood Phe levels, since a nutritionally insufficient diet may also trigger catabolism. For all these reasons, the prescription formula is an important part of the treatment for patients with classic PKU. leu, tyr, trp, met, his, ile, val, thr) may compete with phe for specific carrier proteins that transport LNAAs across the intestinal mucosa into the blood and across the blood–brain barrier into the brain. Enzyme substitutes\nIn 2018, the FDA approved an enzyme substitute called pegvaliase which metabolizes phenylalanine. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (a cofactor for the oxidation of phenylalanine) when taken by mouth can reduce blood levels of this amino acid in some people. Mothers\nFor women with PKU, it is important for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. In most countries, women with PKU who wish to have children are advised to lower their blood Phe levels (typically to between 2 and 6 mg/dL) before they become pregnant, and carefully control their levels throughout the pregnancy. This is achieved by performing regular blood tests and adhering very strictly to a diet, in general monitored on a day-to-day basis by a specialist metabolic dietitian. In many cases, as the fetus' liver begins to develop and produce PAH normally, the mother's blood Phe levels will drop, requiring an increased intake to remain within the safe range of 2–6 mg/dL. The mother's daily Phe intake may double or even triple by the end of the pregnancy, as a result. When maternal blood Phe levels fall below 2 mg/dL, anecdotal reports indicate that the mothers may suffer adverse effects, including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and general malaise. When low phenylalanine levels are maintained for the duration of pregnancy, there are no elevated levels of risk of birth defects compared with a baby born to a non-PKU mother. It is the most common amino acid metabolic problem in the United Kingdom. History\n\nBefore the causes of PKU were understood, PKU caused severe disability in most people who inherited the relevant mutations. Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winning author Pearl S. Buck had a daughter named Carol who lived with PKU before treatment was available, and wrote an account of its effects in a book called The Child Who Never Grew. Phenylketonuria was discovered by the Norwegian physician Ivar Asbjørn Følling in 1934 when he noticed hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) was associated with intellectual disability. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called phenylketonuria (PKU). In 1954, Horst Bickel, Evelyn Hickmans and John Gerrard published a paper that described how they created a diet that was low in phenylalanine and the patient recovered. They were called for by the patient organizations such as the European Society for Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders Treated as Phenylketonuria. Individuals suffering from phenylketonuria lack the enzyme to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine so low levels of this amino acid need to be \n\nThe potential consequences of leaving phenylketonuria (PKU) untreated can be severe. PKU is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is needed to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. Without proper treatment, phenylalanine levels can accumulate and lead to various complications. One of the main consequences of untreated PKU is problems with brain development. Additionally, individuals with untreated PKU are at an increased risk of developing seizures. A low-phenylalanine diet and a high-tyrosine diet are recommended for individuals with PKU. This involves avoiding foods that are high in phenylalanine, such as certain meats, dairy products, and some fruits and vegetables. Instead, individuals with PKU consume specially formulated medical foods that provide adequate nutrition while limiting their intake of phenylalanine. Strict adherence to this dietary management plan can bring about significant improvement in PKU symptoms and prevent long-term complications. It allows for normal growth and development while minimizing the risk of intellectual disability and seizures associated with untreated PKU. Healthcare professionals will work closely with individuals with PKU to ensure they receive appropriate nutritional support and ongoing care. Overall, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of a low-phenylalanine diet are essential for effectively managing PKU and preventing its potential consequences on brain development and overall health.

Skipping exon 51 changes the downstream reading frame of dystrophin; giving eteplirsen to a healthy person would result in production of dystrophin mRNA which would not code for functional dystrophin protein but, for DMD patients with particular nonsense mutations, giving eteplirsen can restore the reading frame of the dystrophin mRNA and result in production of functional (although modified by having an internal deletion consisting of both the patient's original defect, as well as the therapeutically skipped exon) dystrophin. Exon skipping is \n\nExonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are short regions of an exon that function as cis-regulatory elements to inhibit or silence the splicing of pre-mRNA. This inhibition can result in exon skipping or regulate the usage of alternative splice sites. They can inhibit exon inclusion, a process in which an exon is skipped during splicing, leading to the exclusion of the exon from the final mRNA transcript. For example, in myotonic dystrophy (MD), an unstable CTG triplet expansion in the DMPK gene leads to the increased transcription of the IR-A isoform of the insulin receptor mRNA. This upregulation is caused by the ESS nucleotide sequence within intron 10, which silences the splicing of exon 11. As a result, the disease phenotype is manifested. To elicit the silencing affect, ESSs recruit proteins that will negatively affect the core splicing machinery. Mechanism of action \nExonic splicing silencers work by inhibiting the splicing of pre-mRNA strands or promoting exon skipping. ESSs have four general roles:\n inhibiting exon inclusion\n inhibiting intron retention\n regulating alternative 5' splice site usage\n regulating alternative 3' splice site usage\n\nRole in genetic diseases\n\nMyotonic dystrophy \nMyotonic dystrophy (MD) is most noticeably caused by inheriting an unstable CTG triplet expansion in the DMPK gene. Silencing exon 11 splicing leads to the increased transcription of the IR-A isoform. A particular mutation occurs in the CFTR pre-mRNA and leads to the exclusion of exon 9, mRNA lacking this exon folds a truncated protein (a protein shortened by a mutation). Exclusion of exon 9 is mediated by a polymorphic locus with variable TG repeats and stretches of T nucleotides – this is abbreviated as (TG)mT(n). The silencing is related to the high number of TG repeats and decreased stretches of T repeats (T tracts). A combination of both these factors is shown to increase levels of exon skipping. Humans have two isoforms of the SMN (survival motor neuron) gene, SMN1 and SMN2. The SMN1 gene produces a complete transcript, while SMN2 produces a transcript without exon 7 which results in a truncated protein. This sequence arises when a C-to-T mutation occurs at position +6 in exon 7 of the SMN2 gene. This transition point mutation leads to the exclusion of exon 7 from the mRNA transcript, it is also the only difference between the SMN2 and SMN1 gene. Ataxia telangiecstasia \nMutations in the ATM gene are responsible for Ataxia telangiecstasia. These mutations are generally single base pair substitutions, deletions, or micro-insertions. The inclusion of the cryptic exon results in protein truncation and atypical splicing patterns. References \n\nGenetics\n\n A cryptic transcript located at the promoter of PHO5 that is detectable in Δrrp6 mutants is responsible for increasing the speed of promoter remodeling. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused when a mutation in the DMD gene changes the DMD mRNA so that it no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein, usually due to a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon into the mRNA. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, by removing the defective exon the downstream reading frame can be corrected and production of partially functional dystrophin can be restored. This is the general strategy used for designing exon-skipping oligos for DMD; as there are 79 exons transcribed in the longest splice form of the dystrophin transcript, many different oligos are needed to address the range of mutations present in the\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about medical genetics.
