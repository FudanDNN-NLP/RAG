Breaking this assumption means that the Gauss–Markov theorem does not apply, meaning that OLS estimators are not the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) and their variance is not the lowest of all other unbiased estimators. Heteroscedasticity does not cause ordinary least squares coefficient estimates to be biased, although it can cause ordinary least squares estimates of the variance (and, thus, standard errors) of the coefficients to be biased, possibly above or below the true of population variance. Thus, regression analysis using heteroscedastic data will still provide an unbiased estimate for the relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome, \n\n electromechanical desk \"calculators\" to calculate regressions. Before 1970, it sometimes took up to 24 hours to receive the result from one regression. In recent decades, new methods have been developed for robust regression, regression involving correlated responses such as time series and growth curves, regression in which the predictor (independent variable) or response variables are curves, images, graphs, or other complex data objects, regression methods accommodating various types of missing data, nonparametric regression, Bayesian methods for regression, regression in which the predictor variables are measured with error, regression with more predictor variables than observations, and causal inference with regression. It is often useful to compare the measure being validated to relevant outcomes of interest.With regression, different variances may be observed depending on the assignment of measures to independent and dependent variables.Correlation coefficients suggest a relationship between the two measures, and do not necessarily infer that the measures capture the same parameter.In aging research, reclassification methods have been used to test the validity of biomarkers [62] and risk models for predicting cardiovascular disease risk, such as the Framingham Risk Score, [61, 63, 75] and risk of osteoporotic fracture, such as FRAX model [64]. [57] used multiple linear regression to estimate the amount of variance of the SPPB summary score that was accounted for by an alternative method of measurement, self-reported function, adjusting for age and sex. They found that self-reported function alone accounted for 42% of the variance and that adding age and sex to the model accounted for an additional 4%, which illustrates that while the proportion of variance explained by self-reported function was high, there was still a considerable proportion of variance that remained unexplained. With regression, different variances may be observed depending on the assignment of measures to independent and dependent variables. It is often useful to compare the measure being validated to relevant outcomes of interest.Using Cox proportional hazards regression, Guralnik et al. For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis ) or estimate the conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression). First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has \n\nAccording to the Gauss-Markov theorem, for the least-squares estimator to be the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the coefficients in a linear model, several conditions need to be satisfied. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables should be linear. It's important to note that while these conditions are necessary for achieving BLUE estimators, they do not require assumptions about normal distribution, independence, or identical distribution of errors.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

The effectiveness of this methodology has been verified through theoretical and experimental analysis. In terms of convergence speed, precision, and generalization across different network models, datasets, optimization strategies, and recognition tasks, the proposed methodology has shown promising results. Experimental analysis has been conducted using various network models including AlexNet, VggNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Different datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, PASCAL VOC, and COCO have been utilized for evaluation. The methodology has also been tested with different optimization strategies (such as SGD, Momentum, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, and ADAM) and recognition tasks, including classification and detection, further confirming its validity and suitability across various scenarios. To program the simulated robot also the programming language NEPO may be used. The commissural fibers or transverse fibers are axons that connect the two hemispheres of the brain. In contrast to commissural fibers, association fibers connect regions within the same hemisphere of the brain, and projection fibers connect each region to other parts of the brain or to the spinal cord. Structure\nThe commissural fibers make up tracts that include the corpus callosum, the anterior commissure, and the posterior commissure. A recent study of individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum suggests that the corpus callosum plays a vital role in problem solving strategies, verbal processing speed, and executive performance. Specifically, the absence of a fully developed corpus callosum is shown to have a significant relationship with impaired verbal processing speed and problem solving. Using diffusion tensor imaging, researchers have been able to produce a visualization of this network of fibers, which shows the corpus callosum has an anteroposterior topographical organization that is uniform with the cerebral cortex. The great majority of fibers connecting the two hemispheres travel through the corpus callosum, which is over 10 times larger than the anterior commissure, and other routes of communication pass through the hippocampal commissure or, indirectly, via subcortical connections. Through diffusion tensor imaging results, the anterior commissure was categorized into two fiber systems: 1) the olfactory fibers and 2) the non-olfactory fibers. This study explains how visual information from the left side of the visual field is received by the right visual cortex and then transferred to the word form system in the left hemisphere though the posterior commissure and the splenium. Other\nThe lyra or hippocampal commissure. Specifically, the posterior fibers of the corpus callosum are associated with episodic memory. As fiber tract connectivity in the corpus callosum declines due to aging, compensatory mechanisms are found in other areas of the corpus callosum and frontal lobe. Other animals \nThe corpus callosum allows for communication between the two hemispheres and is found only in placental mammals. The anterior commissure  serves as the primary mode of interhemispheric communication in marsupials, and which carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex (also known as the neopallium), whereas in placental mammals the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers).

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. (2007) compared different methods, such as Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) and Kernel Logistic Regression, for multi-class probabilities in medical decision making. (2014, 2015) developed automated classification systems using machine learning techniques like support vector machines and image processing with a local binary pattern operator. (2003) developed least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) models to predict the malignancy of ovarian tumors. In the case of backpropagation based artificial neural networks or perceptrons, the type of decision boundary that the network can learn is determined by the number of hidden layers the network has. If it has no hidden layers, then it can only learn linear problems. If it has one hidden layer, then it can learn any continuous function on compact subsets of Rn as shown by the Universal approximation theorem, thus it can have an arbitrary decision boundary. In particular, support vector machines find a hyperplane that separates the feature space into two classes with the maximum margin. If the problem is not originally linearly separable, the kernel trick can be used to turn it into a linearly separable one, by increasing the number of dimensions. Thus a general hypersurface in a small dimension space is turned into a hyperplane in a space with much larger dimensions. Neural networks try to learn the decision boundary which minimizes the empirical error, while support vector machines try to learn the decision boundary which maximizes the empirical margin between the decision boundary and data points. However, these algorithms often produce classifiers with weaknesses in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces fuzzy support vector machine which is a learning algorithm based on combination of fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines for microarray classification. Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the interpretable rule-base inferred from fuzzy support vector machine helps extracting biological knowledge from microarray data. Fuzzy support vector machine as a new classification model with high generalization power, robustness, and good interpretability seems to be a promising tool for gene expression microarray classification. Many machine learning algorithms are designed and applied for microarray classification problem which some of them provided fruitful results but due to the challenges of dealing with microarrays researchers are still working on designing more accurate, robust, and interpretable models for microarray classification. Furthermore, feature selection decreases the chance of overfitting and increases the chance of producing more understandable results. On the other hand, the multivariate filter methods like multiple hypothesis testing models [5, 6] consider the interconnection between features and are slower than univariate approaches. It is important to note that univariate filter methods are usually faster than the multivariate filter methods as they ignore interconnection of genes and the multivariate filter methods are usually faster than wrapper methods as they ignore interactions with the classifier, but wrapper methods and multivariate filter methods consider interconnection of genes and have the chance of finding the best subset that work together in determination of the class label of the given problem. Supervised learning is a process in which the class labels of a set of instances are given and by applying a learning method, we build a classifier which can be used later in determining the class label of new instances. Various classification models have been applied on microarrays like support vector machine (SVM) [11, 12], artificial neural network (ANN) , decision trees [10, 14], k nearest neighbors (KNN) , diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) . SVM in a binary classification problem finds maximum margin classifier among many different classifiers that can separate instances of two classes. The points that lie closest to this max-margin hyperplane are called the support vectors. The hyperplane can be defined using these points alone and the classifier only makes use of these support vectors to classify test samples. In the case that data points are not linearly separable in the input space, one solution is to map the input space into a higher dimensional feature space called kernel space . The reasons of its good performance are its ability in dealing with high dimensional problems, ability in dealing with noisy features, scalability, and its high generalization power. The internal nodes are associated with a splitting criterion which consists of a splitting attribute and one or more splitting predicates defined on this attribute. The leaf nodes are labelled with a single class label. In the first phase, the growing phase, an overgrown decision tree is built from the training data. The splitting criterion at each internal node is chosen to split the data sets into subsets that have better class separability, thus minimizing the misclassification error. They have many advantages that make them a suitable choice for microarray classification like scalability, fast setup, independence of input parameters, and generating rule-based models. Disadvantage of decision trees that appears in high dimensional problems like microarray classification is that they become overfitted easily [10, 14]. In KNN classifier, class label of an unseen instance is determined by a majority voting on the class label of its k nearest neighbors and correlation or Euclidean distance is usually used to calculate distance of two samples. The basic idea of LDA is to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space such that the data points are reshaped to maximize the class separability. The optimal projection of classical LDA is obtained by maximizing the between-class distance while minimizing the within-class distance . In high dimensional problems with few samples like the case of microarrays a great challenge to classical LDA is the singularity and instability of the within-group sum of squares matrix or the sample covariance matrix. Therefore, the covariance matrix will be singular if the total number of observations in the training data (N) is less than the number of features (P) or might be very unstable and noisy if N is not significantly larger than P. It has been shown that the performance of LDA in high-dimensional situations is far from optimal. But, as more features are added to a given model, the complexity of the model is increased and as a consequence the overfitting chance and the misclassification rate of new samples increases . To do so we apply an additive fuzzy system to kernel machines, and demonstrate that, under a general assumption on membership functions, an additive fuzzy rule-based classification system can be constructed directly from the given training samples using the support vector learning approach. Here, we explain the feature selection methods, the supervised learning method, and the model evaluation strategy used in this study. Here, we use a common filter feature selection technique (signal to noise ratio (SNR) ) and a common wrapper feature selection technique (support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE)) [20, 21]. SNR was used in the first reported study of application of machine learning in microarray classification domain conducted by Golub et al. In this formula, µi(+) and σi(+) respectively represent mean and standard deviation of positively labeled samples and µi(-) and σi(-) respectively represent mean and standard deviation of negatively labeled samples. The second step in microarray classification is taken in order to build a reliable model on training samples which can correctly predict class label of test samples. Here, we apply fuzzy support vector machine algorithm for supervised learning [22, 23]. This method has combined the good generalization performance and ability to work in high dimensional spaces of support vector machine algorithm with high interpretability of fuzzy rule based models. A model with these properties is expected to overcome the challenges of dealing with microarrays very well. One particular kind of kernel, Mercer kernel, has received considerable attention in the machine learning literature  because it is an efficient way of extending linear learning machines to nonlinear ones. Fuzzy support vector machine is a fuzzy rule-based model in which membership functions are reference functions with location transformation and given input x → determines output class label by equation (9) in which K ( x → , z J ⃗ ) is a Mercer kernel defined by equation (8). Steps of setting up fuzzy support vector machine classification model and rule extraction are as shown in Figure 1. In order to assess the performance of the proposed model and compare the accuracy of this classifier with the accuracy of the state-of-the-art classifiers, 10-fold cross validation strategy is used. The following is a brief introduction about these datasets, while more detailed information can be found from, respectively, the indicated data resources. In this section we review the four hypotheses that we defined to explore power of fuzzy support vector machine model in microarray studies. Hypothesis 1: how is the performance of fuzzy support vector machine model in comparison with the performance of common classification models used on microarrays like SVM, ANN, decision trees like CART, KNN, and DLDA? Experiment 1: we train all these classifiers on the original microarray datasets without doing any kind of feature selection and compare the accuracy of these models. Hypothesis 2: does fuzzy support vector machine model benefit from feature selection? Experiment 3: we first set up fuzzy support vector machine classifier without taking the feature selection step and then we set up fuzzy support vector machine classifier with taking the feature selection step by use of both SNR and SVM-RFE methods and then compare the accuracy of these models. Hypothesis 3: is the output rule-base generated by fuzzy support vector machine model useful for extracting meaningful information for biomedical researchers? Experiment 4: as an instance of the rule-base generated by fuzzy support vector machine, we first apply SNR feature selection method on leukemia dataset and select three genes and then we set up fuzzy support vector machine classifier on those genes. We explore some characteristics of the model by taking a deeper look at the rule-base. Hypothesis 4: is fuzzy support vector machine model a robust one for microarray classification? We have two parameters in fuzzy support vector machine classification model: (1) C which is the misclassification cost of support vector machine classifier and (2) the number of selected features. Experiment 6: we select features by applying both SNR and SVM-RFE feature selection methods and after that we set up fuzzy support vector machine models on selected features. Experiment 1: the result of running the first experiment is presented in table 2. Fuzzy support vector machine classifier is sensitive to noisy and irrelevant features more than SVM, KNN, and DLDA classifiers but is not as sensitive as ANN and CART classifiers. Accuracy of fuzzy support vector machine model versus accuracy of common classification models used on microarrays when no feature selection step is taken. As you see in this table the performance of fuzzy support vector machine classifier is better than SVM, ANN, KNN, CART, and DLDA classifiers when we use a feature selection method as simple as SNR before setting up the classification model. As you see in this table the performance of fuzzy support vector machine model when SNR or SVM-RFE feature selection methods applied is better than the performance of fuzzy support vector machine model in case no feature selection step is taken. Rule-base of fuzzy support vector machine on leukemia dataset. It is important to emphasize that fuzzy support vector machine is not the only interpretable model suggested for microarray classification and there are other interpretable models like the iGEC proposed by Ho, Hsieh, Chen, and Huang  for microarray classification. But as you notice the fuzzy support vector machine model is not too much sensitive to the value of misclassification cost (C) parameter. Accuracy of fuzzy support vector machine for different values of C.\nExperiment 6: the result of running the sixth experiment is shown in Figure 4, 5, and 6. As you see, models built on features selected by both techniques are not sensitive to the changes of number of genes. Comparison of feature selection methods on colon cancer dataset. In this paper, we have analyzed the prediction power of fuzzy support vector machine classifier on three different microarray classification problems. The experimental results show that fuzzy support vector machine has several advantages for microarray classification. First, fuzzy support vector machine combined with a feature selection method has higher generalization ability than common classification models for microarrays like support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbor, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Second, this model is robust in terms of the value of the parameter C and is not sensitive to the changes of the number of selected features. The authors believe that an accurate and interpretable model like fuzzy support vector machine finds high interest among biologist, physicians, and bioinformaticians who work on microarray classification problem. MH designed the experiments, participated in the implementation of the FSVM technique, and drafted the manuscript. The role of the bit-based support vector machine (SVM) in mitigating distortions in millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber (RoF) mobile fronthaul systems is to serve as a non-parameter nonlinear mitigation approach. Overall, the bit-based support vector machine plays a crucial role in mitigating distortions in millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber mobile fronthaul systems by effectively handling nonlinear noise through its nonlinear decision boundaries and adaptability to specific system characteristics.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

CNNs excel in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation due to their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data. Additionally, CNNs have fewer parameters compared to fully connected neural networks, making them computationally efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting. This distinct architecture and feature extraction capability contribute to their superior performance in image and video processing tasks. We propose a deep learning architecture, based on VGG-16 network for learning high-level image representation to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image binary classification tasks by dividing whole-slide images on 50x50 pixel histology image patches. We aim to learn discriminant compact features at beginning of our deep convolutional neural network. Key words: breast cancer, biopsy, deep learning, machine learning, VGG16, convolutional neural network. This success has prompted a surge of interest in applying deep convolutional networks (DCN) to medical imaging. Many recent studies have shown the potential of applying such networks to medical imaging, including breast screening mammography; however, without investigating the fundamental differences between medical and natural images and their impact on the design choices and performance of proposed models. For instance, many recent works have either significantly downscaled a whole image or focused on classifying a small region of interest. Furthermore, the potential of DCNs has only been assessed in limited settings of small data sets often consisting of less than 1000 images, while the success of such networks in natural object recognition is largely attributed to the availability of more than 1M annotated images. 2278–2324] is a classifier that takes an image x as input, often with multiple channels corresponding to different colors (e.g., RGB), and outputs the conditional probability distribution over the categories. This is done by a series of nonlinear functions that gradually transform the input pixel-level image. A major property of the deep convolutional network, which distinguishes it from a multi-layer perceptron, is that it heavily relies on convolutional and pooling layers, which make the network invariant to local translation of visual features in the input. Slides from the 1-st and 2-d sources was also divided on 50x50 pixel patches. In situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma (label 1) – 397632 patches. In situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma (label 1) – 79526 patches. We using Keras for model training (currently transfer learning by fine-tuning a modified Vgg16 model). Our model takes as input the pixel values of the individual samples and is trained to predict the probability is this sample from the malignant tumor or from normal tissue. We chose a VGG-16 network to classify the 50×50 histology image patches in order to explore the scale and organization features of nuclei and the scale features of the overall structure. Because they do not have complicated high-level semantic information, a 16-layer structure suffices. To leverage contextual information from the cropped images, we added global context to the last convolutional layer of the VGG networks. The input images are passed to two independent branches, our VGG network and a global average pooling layer. The transformed output of the global pooling layer is unpooled to the same shape as that of the feature maps after the last convolutional layer of the VGG network and is then concatenated with the feature maps. These two feature maps are then fused by another 1×1 convolutional layer and then passed through three fully-connected (FC) layers for classification. The most informative magnification level is still debatable, so we’ve included two possible scales in our work for comparison. The AWS g3 instance has NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs, each with 2048 parallel processing cores and 8 GiB of video memory which enables to run a complicated network structure. The reason that we can do so is because the ImageNet has very large amount of dataset and is trained quite well. We can make full use of the pre-trained model and get the feature based on the ImageNet dataset. where TN(true negative) is the number of non-cancer patches(normal tissue or benign lesions) which have been successfully classified, and FP(false positive) is the number of non-cancer patches which have been wrongly classified as cancer. In the data science competitions(like Kaggle competitions),the competitors were evaluated their results using the log-loss metric. To assess overall classification relevance, we therefore compute the F1-score, too. In this paper, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network architecture for binary classification of breast tissue biopsies that had aimed to learn high-order convolutional features at the initial layers of the model. - Access mode: NationalBreastCancerFoundation.

The edge map can then be used to guide a deformable model, sometimes called anactive contour or a snake, so that it passes through the edge map in a smooth way, therefore defining the object itself. A common way to encourage a deformable model to move toward the edge map is to take the spatial gradient of the edge map, yielding a vector field. Since the edge map has its highest intensities directly on the edge and drops \n\nHuman papilloma virus detection in oropharyngeal carcinomas with in situ hybridisation using hand crafted morphological features and deep central attention residual networks. This paper proposes an intelligent image analysis framework to determine HPV status in digitized samples of oropharyngeal cancer tissue micro-arrays (TMA). We then extract relevant morphological measurements from those regions which are then input into a supervised learning model for the identification of HPV status. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on 2009 TMA images of oropharyngeal carcinoma tissues captured with a ×20 objective. We also tested the performance of end-to-end deep learning classification methods to assess HPV status by learning directly from the original ISH processed images, rather than from the handcrafted features extracted from the segmented images. We examined the performance of sequential convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures including three popular image recognition networks (VGG-16, ResNet and Inception V3) in their pre-trained and trained from scratch versions, however their highest classification accuracy was inferior (78%) to the hybrid pipeline presented here. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces. Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification and others.

The EM algorithm addresses the challenges in estimating the Copas selection model by maximizing the observed likelihood based on the full likelihood. This is necessary because the observed data contain very little information on the latent variable. The EM algorithm iteratively maximizes the likelihood by estimating the latent variable and then updating the parameters based on the expectation of the complete data. The EM algorithm performs well in terms of avoiding the non-convergence problem that can occur when maximizing the observed likelihood under the Copas selection model. The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples. ; Pseudo-marginal Metropolis–Hastings: This method replaces the evaluation of the density of the target distribution with an unbiased estimate and is useful when the target density is not available analytically, e.g. It alternates uniform sampling \n\n into account is a reason why Bayesian inference has been put forward as a theoretical justification for and generalisation of Occam's razor, reducing Type I errors. On the other hand, the modern method of relative likelihood takes into account the number of free parameters in the models, unlike the classical likelihood ratio. The relative likelihood method could be applied as follows. We want to compare a model M1 where the probability of success is q = ½, and another model M2 where q is unknown and we take a prior distribution for q that is uniform on [0,1]. The likelihood can be calculated according to the binomial distribution: (rather than averaging over all possible q). That gives a likelihood ratio of 0.1 and points towards M2.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Each iteration takes one step in the negative gradient of the point with controlled step size\n\nThe training strategy used in the broad learning system (BLS) differs significantly from the mainstream neural network training strategy based on the gradient descent algorithm. Traditionally, neural networks are trained using the gradient descent algorithm, which involves updating the network's parameters based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to those parameters. This requires going through multiple iterations or epochs to iteratively adjust the parameters in order to minimize the error. It achieves this by utilizing dynamic update algorithms that perform update iterations on existing parameters. By applying pseudoinversion to the weight updating process, BLS can effectively update its parameters without going through a complete training cycle or relying solely on gradient-based optimization. (In theory, these methods terminate in a finite number of steps with quadratic objective functions, but \n\n better convergence properties than the Nelder–Mead heuristic (with simplices), which is listed below. While evaluating Hessians (H) and gradients (G) improves the rate of convergence, for functions for which these quantities exist and vary sufficiently smoothly, such evaluations increase the computational complexity (or computational cost) of each iteration. In some cases, the computational complexity may be excessively high. One major criterion for optimizers is just the number of required function evaluations as this often is already a large computational effort, usually much more effort than within the optimizer itself, which \n\n finite termination is not observed in practice on finite–precision computers.) ; Gradient descent (alternatively, \"steepest descent\" or \"steepest ascent\"): A (slow) method of historical and theoretical interest, which has had renewed interest for finding approximate solutions of enormous problems. ; Subgradient methods: An iterative method for large locally Lipschitz functions using generalized gradients.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams. Bayesian hierarchical modelling is a statistical model written in multiple levels (hierarchical form) that estimates the parameters of the posterior distribution using the Bayesian method. The sub-models combine to form the hierarchical model, and Bayes' theorem is used to integrate them with the observed data and account for all the uncertainty that is present. The result of this integration is the posterior distribution, also known as the updated probability estimate, as additional evidence on the prior distribution is acquired. Frequentist statistics may yield conclusions seemingly incompatible with those offered by Bayesian statistics due to the Bayesian treatment of the parameters as random variables and \n\nCopyright © 2013 Benjamin W. Y. The approach of Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences was applied to data from five trials of Tirilazad for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (3551 patients). Bayesian meta-analyses of observational studies on aSAH prognostic factors gave generalizable posterior distributions of population mean log odd ratios (ORs). Similar trends were noted in Bayesian and linear regression ORs. Heteroscedasticity was present in the nontransformed dataset. Artificial neural networks found nonlinear relationships with 11 hidden variables in 1 layer, using the multilayer perceptron model. Three of these include artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and bayesian analysis [1–3]. These techniques complement classical or frequentist approaches, such as regression analysis. Examples of biological neural networks include the human brain and the human retina. Analogous to the biological system, artificial neural networks are made up of a group of input variables which converge on a number of nodes. Hidden or latent variables can exist in one or two layers. artificial neural networks assume all or none logic, that is, subjects are regarded as having or not having a diagnosis. Nodes in the neural nets are connected with each other via connection links. In addition, they also take into account unobservable variables that the researcher is not aware of while designing the neural net. Figure 1: Artificial Neural Network with 3 inputs, 2 hidden nodes and 2 outputs. Here, existing knowledge is expressed in the form of distributions (such as the normal bell-shaped distribution). The “prior” distribution is then combined with its likelihood of occurrence, forming a posterior probability. If there is a lack of existing knowledge on the subject of interest, the researcher can still rely on Bayesian techniques. In the Bayesian approach to artificial neural networks , the goal is to find the predictive distribution for target values in the new test case/model, given inputs for that case and inputs/targets in training cases. Here, represents the probability of data according to a particular model. It is an integral, representing the summation of all possible parameter values weighted by the strength of belief (as assigned by the researcher) in these parameter values, or The probability of a new case/model given existing cases and associated parameters (, incorporating both weights and biases) is expressed as In general, Bayesian neural networks can be expressed as: Posterior probability density is proportional to product of prior probability density and its associated likelihood. Likelihood, as explained above, is the product of probabilities of data given parameters (weights and biases) as Fuzzy logic is an extension of neural nets, but with the distinct advantage that it can assume functions with any value from 0 to 1, accounting for the entire spectrum of certainty of diagnoses and spectrum of severity of diseases studied. On the other hand, some regard this strength of fuzzy logic as a limitation. Unlike neural nets, where learning is done by the nets themselves as they gain experience from datasets, fuzzy logic systems cannot train themselves. The designer has to derive all action commands (in the form of “if-then” rules) manually, which is labour intensive with large datasets. Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences can be represented as follows: where defuzz can be max-min, centroid, left of mean, right of mean, or another defuzzification crisp control action rule. We explore novel methods that account for existing states of knowledge (Bayesian meta-analysis and regression), complex nonlinear relationships between independent, latent, and dependent variables (artificial neural networks), and grey zones in prognoses (fuzzy Logic decision rules). Derivation of prognostic decision rules comprised of the following investigations: multivariable linear regression (IBM SPSS version 19.0 (Armonk, NY, USA)), artificial neural networks (IBM SPSS), Bayesian regression with uninformed and informed prior likelihoods (WinBUGS 1.4.3), neural networks with Bayesian regularization (MATLAB R2012a (Natick, MA, USA); version R 2.15.2), and creation of fuzzy logic decision rules, with clinical case application. Included in the analysis were predictor variables from the Tirilazad database, without recoding, renaming, reclassification, or data transformation. As heteroscedasticity is present, we cannot be confident that the strength of prediction of the linear regression equation from this multiple linear regression model is equally strong across all levels of the included independent variables. Beta coefficients of prognostic variables generated with Bayesian regression (WinBUGS version 1.4.3) using uninformed priors are similar in magnitude to those generated from frequentist multiple regression analysis, as demonstrated in Table 2. Table 2: Results of Bayesian regression analysis of predictors of neurologic outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage using uninformed priors. Bayesian meta-analysis synthesizes research evidence from multiple independent studies. It has a hierarchical structure, placing one layer of sampling above another, with each study population having an observed odds ratio estimated from its sample of subjects. Bayesian meta-analysis models created using WinBUGS version 1.4.3 for this study gave generalizable posterior distributions of consensus odds ratios with representative medians, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals, for the prognostic variables age [15–21], neurological grade [16–20, 22, 23], and aneurysmal size [17, 19, 23–27]. Results of hierarchical meta-analysis are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Results of Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis using WinBUGS version 1.4.3 generate posterior distributions of consensus odds ratios with representative medians, standard deviations, and 95% credible intervals, for predictor variables age, neurological grade, and aneurysm size. They also represent the informed priors for Bayesian regression models. Because of this database’s very large sample size (), beta coefficients generated with Bayesian regression (uninformed priors) are similar in magnitude to those generated from Bayesian regression (informed priors). Table 4: Results of Artificial Neural Networks reveal normalized importance values of predictor variables in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Interrelationships between input nodes (predictor variables), hidden variables (11 of them in one hidden layer), and output nodes (Glasgow outcome score) are illustrated in Figure 2. In this case, our three linguistic variables are (1) demographic risk factor cluster, (2) systemic risk factor cluster, and (3) neurologic risk factor cluster. The techniques of bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences were applied to the Tirilazad database. In addition, Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences will be applied to the SAHIT database. These popular techniques produce interpretable coefficients for explanatory variables and are easily estimated using commercially available statistical programs. Greater deviations from linearity point to the need for exploratory analyses with complex nonlinear systems. Typical artificial neural networks can fit training data with high precision and detect nonlinear relationships among predictor variables, with the overall aim of predicting yet to be seen observations. Neural networks also incorporate latent (unobserved variables) in one or two hidden layers. Interrelationships between independent, latent, and outcome variables are assigned synaptic weights, or connection strengths. The sum of all relative importance values of input variables (representing influences of predictor variables on clinical outcome in relation to the rest of the independent variables) equals 100 percent. Over- and underfitting can occur in these cases, which, in turn, can affect model generalization. Neural networks with Bayesian regularization technique have been devised to overcome the above problem, whereby weights are assigned probability density distributions, incorporating Bayesian statistics to estimate weight uncertainty, or the relative degree of belief in the different values for synaptic weights. Typical artificial neural networks give fixed structures, whereas Bayesian neural networks give flexible structures. Bayesian neural networks are ones that assign probability distributions to all elements of the network, including inputs, hidden nodes, outputs, as well as their associated weights. Prior likelihoods for probability distributions can be generated using Bayesian meta-analysis. Bayesian regularization terms are included, which prevent model over- and underfitting. In addition, Bayesian Neural Networks give generalizable posterior distributions without compromising nonlinearity properties. Bayesian Neural Networks are trained by sampling from joint posterior likelihoods of network structure and weights by Monte Carlo sampling methods. The larger the sample size, the smaller the Bayesian posterior probability distribution ranges. If data points fall into a linear relationship, typical artificial neural networks and Bayesian neural networks can detect this relationship. Hence, linear regression can be viewed as a special case of neural networks. Typical artificial neural network and Bayesian neural network error can be due to network weight uncertainty (model uncertainty due to imperfections in data, nonoptimum network structure, and nonoptimum learning algorithms), and error from remaining sources, including intrinsic noise that includes random error due to measurement noise, and error due to finite resolution of observation system. If posterior distributions of weights are very narrow in relation to noise distribution, then the width of distribution of networks outputs can be influenced by noise. On the other hand, if the posterior distributions of weights are larger than noise distribution, then, the width of network outputs is dominated by distribution of network weights. Results generated from Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inferences will, then, slightly differ from case to case, accounting for the special characteristics of that certain case. In other words, one should allow the Bayesian neural network learning machine to do its own learning before applying fuzzy logic rules, so that all probability distributions are explored. Bayesian neural networks with fuzzy logic inference can be conceptually interpreted as follows. If it falls outside the spectrum in real life, then, one has to check whether there are still unknown elements influencing the outcome variable in question. D. Spiegelhalter, K. Abrams, and J. Myles, Bayesian Approaches To Clinical Trials and Health-Care Evaluation, Wiley, Chichester, UK, 2002.\n\n into account is a reason why Bayesian inference has been put forward as a theoretical justification for and generalisation of Occam's razor, reducing Type I errors.

High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data. It is an often made fallacy to assume that complex models must have high variance; High variance models are 'complex' in some sense, but the reverse needs not be true. Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. More generally it is only in restricted classes of problems that there will be an estimator that minimises the MSE independently of the parameter values. ; Equality (or \"homogeneity\") of variances, called homoscedasticity — the variance of data in groups should be the same.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.
