Due to manufacturing differences between the two detectors, their respective detection windows will be shifted by some finite amount. The only way to eliminate this vulnerability is to eliminate differences in photodetector efficiency, which is difficult to do given finite manufacturing tolerances that cause optical path length differences, wire length differences, and other defects. The variance of the photon number distribution is \n\nThe advantages of using GaAsP hybrid detectors in fluorescence lifetime microscopy, compared to photon counting detectors currently in use, are as follows:\n\n1. Improved quantum efficiency: GaAsP hybrid detectors have a detection quantum efficiency that reaches or even surpasses the efficiency of fast single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). This means that they are able to detect a higher percentage of photons, resulting in a better signal-to-noise ratio and more accurate measurement of lifetimes. Larger active area: GaAsP hybrid detectors have an active area that is on the order of 5 mm², compared to the significantly smaller active area of about 2.5 × 10⁻³ mm² for a SPAD. The larger active area allows for the detection of more photons, thereby increasing the overall sensitivity of the detector. Clean temporal response: GaAsP hybrid detectors have a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) response that is clean, without the presence of \"bumps\" and diffusion tails that are typical in conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and SPADs. Photo detection efficiency (PDE) ranges from 20 to 50%, depending on device and wavelength, being similar to a traditional PMT ; Gain (G) is also similar to a PMT, being about 106 ; G vs. Vb dependence is linear and does not follow a power law like in the case of PMTs ; Timing jitter is optimized to have a photon arrival time resolution of about 100-300 ps ; Signal decay time is inversely proportional to square root of photoelectrons number within an excitation event ; The signal parameters are practically independent of external magnetic fields, in contrast to vacuum PMTs ; Afterpulsing probability (3-30%), defined as probability of spurious second pulses after single photon arrival ; Dark count density is frequency of \n\n In order to ensure a small virtual mass of the target photon one uses the so-called anti-tagging.

This effect, known as thin-film interference, is observable in soap bubbles and oil slicks. Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such \n\n Dichroic filters use the principle of thin-film interference, and produce colors in the same way as oil films on water. When light strikes an oil film at an angle, some of the light is reflected from the top surface of the oil, and some is reflected from the bottom surface where it is in contact with the water. Because the light reflecting from the bottom travels a slightly longer path, some light wavelengths are reinforced by this delay, while others tend to be canceled, producing the colors seen. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. The refractive index of air is 1.00, while the refractive index of water is approximately 1.33. When light passes from air into water, it undergoes refraction, causing the light rays to bend. Oil has a refractive index of approximately 1.51, closer to that of glass (1.51) used in lenses. By using an oil immersion lens underwater, the refractive index of the lens material aligns more closely with that of water, reducing the refractive mismatch and minimizing the distortion of light rays. This medium, typically an immersion oil with a refractive index close to that of glass, eliminates the refractive barrier between the lens and the water. As a result, there is less bending and scattering of light as it passes from water to the oil to the lens, leading to enhanced resolution.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the process is also lost. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state; thus the total entropy change may still be zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. An irreversible process increases the total entropy of system and surroundings. Throughout an entire reversible process, a system in the process is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. Entropy predicts the direction of spontaneous processes, and determines whether they are irreversible or impossible despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. If all processes in the system are reversible, the entropy is constant. An increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to in the concept of the arrow of time. For example, an infinitesimal compression of a gas in a cylinder where there exists friction between the piston and the cylinder is a quasistatic, but not reversible process. Such phenomena are accounted for in terms of entropy. If an isolated system is held initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium by internal partitioning impermeable walls, and then some operation makes the walls more permeable, then the system spontaneously evolves to reach a final new internal thermodynamic\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

Compared to gases and most solid state lasing media, a dye can usually be used for a much wider range of wavelengths, often spanning 50 to 100 nanometers or more. The wide bandwidth makes them particularly suitable for tunable lasers and pulsed lasers. The dye rhodamine 6G, for example, can be tuned from 635 nm (orangish-red) to 560 nm (greenish-yellow), and produce pulses as short as 16 femtoseconds. The dyes used in these lasers contain rather large, organic molecules which fluoresce. Most dyes have a very short time between the absorption and emission of light, referred to as the fluorescence lifetime, which is often on the order of a few nanoseconds. Under standard laser-pumping conditions, the molecules emit their energy before a population inversion can properly build up, so dyes require rather specialized means of pumping. Liquid dyes have an extremely high lasing threshold. In spectroscopy, dye lasers can be used to study the absorption and emission spectra of various materials. Their tunability, (from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet), narrow bandwidth, and high intensity allows a much greater diversity than other light sources. The variety \n\n  A dye laser uses a gain medium consisting of an organic dye, which is a carbon-based, soluble stain that is often fluorescent, such as the dye in a highlighter pen.

The equilibrium ratio of ortho- to para-hydrogen depends on temperature. At room temperature or warmer, equilibrium hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form. The ortho form is an excited state, having higher energy than the para form by 1.455 kJ/mol, and it converts to the para form over the course of several \n\n a number of electrons determined by the Pauli exclusion principle. Thus the n = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the n = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all n = 1 states are fully occupied; the same is true for n = 1 and n = 2 in neon. In argon, the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty. At room temperature, gaseous hydrogen is mostly in the ortho isomeric form due to thermal energy, but an ortho-enriched mixture is only metastable when liquified at low temperature. It slowly undergoes an exothermic reaction to become the para isomer, with enough energy released as heat to cause some of the liquid to boil. To prevent loss of the liquid during long-term storage, it is therefore intentionally converted to the para isomer as part of the production process, typically using a catalyst such as iron(III) oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromium(III) oxide, or some nickel compounds. The observed frequency perturbations in the ortho-rotational and para states of thioformaldehyde are caused by vibronic spin-orbit coupling. As a result, approximately 100 Doppler-limited rovibronic transitions were detected, leading into fine structure states.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

One may think of the electric charge as analogous to the \"charge\" of a gas in a cylinder, with the resulting mechanical force exerted on a piston. The energy stored in a capacitor of capacitance C(x) and charge Q is  The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the linearity of the capacitance—except now Q is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same \"pull\" between a capacitor's plates.

But new research being developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which could reduce the size of proton accelerator machines from that of a football field to that of a traditional X-ray machine, could soon make proton therapy more easily accessible to all. Better-known X-ray radiation goes all the way through the body and can cause healthy cell death, which could be potentially catastrophic depending on where the tumor is located, like near the spinal cord, neck, or in McLaughlin’s case, the sacrum. Proton therapy is different because the proton beam can be controlled to go only as deep as the tumor, precisely targeting it without damaging the surrounding healthy cells and, therefore, causing fewer side effects. McLaughlin’s proton treatment didn’t physically hurt her at all; she was treated 10 minutes a day, five days a week for two and a half months without any side effects. Not only did McLaughlin beat cancer, but she avoided surgery and the painful and potentially very serious side effects of traditional X-ray radiation therapy. Proton-beam therapy has been around for decades. In the late 1980s, Loma Linda University Medical Center installed a proton accelerator and became the first hospital in the world to give proton treatment. But even though proton therapy is not new, it’s still not widely known. With only six proton centers in the U.S. and 25 to 30 centers in the world, most doctors don’t readily recommend the treatment. In addition to their size, proton accelerator machines are up to three stories high and can cost $100 million to build. But Lawrence Livermore’s research, spearheaded by radiation therapy company TomoTherapy, could soon change this. For the past five years, scientists have been working on a compact proton-beam machine called a dielectric wall accelerator (DWA), which works similarly to the giant machine in Loma Linda but is a fifth the cost and only the size of a traditional X-ray machine. When he began research, there were only three proton centers in the U.S., and all used one of the two types of proton beams, cyclotron or synchrotron. The cyclotron is the same kind of machine used to treat McLaughlin’s tumor–it was originally developed for physics research to study the nature of matter but was later adapted for medical purposes. As the particles move down the tube, the energy of the protons can be controlled very precisely and in a targeted manner. The DWA will be more precise than the cyclotron and synchrotron because doctors will be able to administer the therapy more dynamically. The entire system will be able to fit in the same size treatment vault as a traditional X-ray room, which means that, in theory, proton therapy can be as widespread as X-rays, available in any hospital and any town. Having smaller machines and less infrastructure means lower costs, all of which contribute to the scientists’ goal of making proton therapy as accessible as X-ray therapy. This means the possibility for compact proton-beam therapy is imminent and hopefully will make it much easier for people like McLaughlin, now 28, to have the same results in finding a cure for cancer. The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together. One important application is in radiation therapy for cancer treatment. This technology allows for more effective and targeted treatment of cancer. The design of a linac depends on the type of particle being accelerated. Overall, linear particle accelerators have diverse applications ranging from cancer treatment to advancing our understanding of fundamental particles and their interactions in the field of particle physics. - Linacs have many applications: they generate X-rays and high energy electrons for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy, serve as particle injectors for higher-energy accelerators, and are used directly to achieve the highest kinetic energy for light particles (electrons and positrons) for particle physics. - The design of a linac depends on the type of particle that is being accelerated: electrons, protons or ions. - Linacs range in size from a cathode ray tube (which is a type of linac) to the linac at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

For a particle at rest, the relativistic equation E=mc2 allows the derivation of the Compton frequency f for a stationary massive particle, equal to mc2/h. De Broglie also proposed that the wavelength λ for a moving particle was equal to h/p where p is the particle's momentum. The de Broglie relation, also known as the de Broglie's momentum–wavelength relation, generalizes the Planck relation to matter waves. Louis de Broglie argued that if particles had a wave nature, the relation E = hν would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to λ = h⁄p . Combining de Broglie's postulate with the Planck–Einstein relation leads to where p is the momentum vector, and k is the angular wave vector. This theory, developed by de Broglie in 1927 and revived in the 1950s, is the natural continuation of his ideas developed between 1923 and 1926, which extended the wave-particle duality introduced by Albert Einstein for the light quanta, to all the particles of matter.

Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity, facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c. By dividing energy in eV by the speed of light, one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of eV/c.

The momentum per unit mass (proper velocity) of the middle electron is lightspeed, so that its group velocity is 0.707 c. The top electron has twice the momentum, while the bottom electron has half. Note that as the momentum increases, the phase velocity decreases down to c, whereas the group velocity increases up to c, until the wave packet and its phase maxima move together near the speed of light, whereas the wavelength continues to decrease without bound.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.
