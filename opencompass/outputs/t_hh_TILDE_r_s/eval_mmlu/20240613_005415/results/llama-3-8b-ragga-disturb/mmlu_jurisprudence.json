Citizenship, itself, is often considered as the \n\n In international relations, the liberal international order (some times referred to as the rules-based or the US-led international order) describes a set of global, rule-based, structured relationships based on political liberalism, economic liberalism and liberal internationalism since the late 1940s. More specifically, it entails international cooperation through multilateral institutions (like the United Nations, World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund) and is constituted by human equality (freedom, rule of law and human rights), open markets, security cooperation, promotion of liberal democracy, and monetary cooperation. The LIO has been credited with expanding free trade, increasing capital mobility, spreading democracy, promoting human rights, and collectively defending the West from the Soviet Union. The idea of legal evolution first appears in the 18th century. Peter Stein argues that one of the main impetuses in its development was the inadequacy of theories of immemorial custom, popular heritage, sovereign will, and natural reason in explaining how legal systems change. Early examples include Pufendorf and Grotius who, despite their status as exemplars of natural law theorists, recognised that 'government and private property are not 'original' but appear only when man is ready for them'. They were followed by David Hume, who, as part of his argument against social contract theory, suggested law and government formed as a matter of habit over time. However, as he admitted himself, his theory could not capture all legal systems, and its pretensions of universality were replaced with an argument of 'historical types'. This coincided with a split between comparative and historical methodology. The focus on legal types meant the abandonment of any progressive thesis; by 1920 theories of legal evolution were replaced by national historical analysis and the occasional comparison with foreign jurisdiction. Stein suggests that a primary cause of this decline was the lack of optimism in progressive theories of society following the first world war; the abandonment of the idea physics and natural science can be applied directly to social phenomena; and a greater concentration on the development, idiosyncrasies, and history of particular societies. The principle of legal equality is enshrined in basic laws such as the Economic Contract Law (1982), which provides that contracting parties enjoy equal rights, the General Principles of Civil Law (1987), which ascribes various rights universally to all natural persons, and the Administrative Litigation Law (1989), which allows any citizen to file suit against administrative agencies.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

However, a judge has a duty to sit and determine cases.” In this case, however, objective bias had not been established. As the judge noted, \"The applicants have argued that there were seventeen links. Many were repetitive and misunderstood the relationship of counsel to client. McGuinness J similarly concluded that the professional links established did not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Supreme Court accordingly unanimously dismissed the motion.

Another leading sociologist, Émile Durkheim, wrote in his classic work The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions. Other notable early legal sociologists included Hugo Sinzheimer, Theodor Geiger, Georges Gurvitch and Leon Petrażycki in Europe, and William Graham Sumner in the U.S.\n\n legitimacy of these institutions thus reflected the dominant function assumed by these institutions in maintaining and administering societal order. Weber was genuinely alarmed by the prospect that an institutionalized, morally vacuous or pernicious instrumental, and especially, formal, rationality might be used to justify morally questionable ends. Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see traditional authority) uniquely in the Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in Imperial China has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. Weber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. Max Weber distinguished three ideal types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority. He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay The Three Types of Legitimate Rule which was published in his masterwork Economy and Society (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech \"Politics as a Vocation\" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138). According to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about jurisprudence.

In the 1760s, William Blackstone described the thesis:  But John Austin (1790–1859), an early positivist, applied utilitarianism in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence \n\n Several authors have criticized the metalegal principles proposed by Haley and Fasan for their reliance on Immanuel Kant’s Categorical Imperative and on an approach to legal science and jurisprudence known as natural law theory. In jurisprudence, natural law theory refers generally to the view that links law to morality and proposes that just laws are immanent in nature and independent of the lawgiver, waiting to be discovered or found (as opposed to created by humans), usually by means of reason alone. Thomism recognizes four different species of law, which he defines as \"an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated\": The development of natural law is one of the most influential parts of Thomist philosophy. Aquinas says that \"[the law \n\n different kinds of law? Aquinas establishes four types of laws: eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. Eternal law “Gods providence rules the world…his reason evidently governs the entire community in the universe.” (91.1) Aquinas believes that eternal law is all God’s doing. “Human law originally sprang from nature.” (91.3) The last is Divine law which is important because “it belongs to any law to be directed to the common good at its end.” (91.4) Theses laws all go together and \n\n Augustine was among the earliest to examine the legitimacy of the laws of man, and attempt to define the boundaries of what laws and rights occur naturally, instead of being arbitrarily imposed by mortals.
