It examines aesthetic values, often expressed through judgments of taste. Aesthetics covers both natural and artificial sources of aesthetic experience and judgment. It considers what happens in our minds when we engage with aesthetic objects or environments such as viewing visual art, listening to music, reading poetry, experiencing a play, or exploring nature. Aesthetics considers why people like some works of art and not others, as well as how art can affect moods or even our beliefs. In modern English, the term \"aesthetic\" can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory (one speaks, for example, of a Renaissance aesthetic). Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. But aesthetics typically considers questions of beauty as well as of art. It examines topics such as art works, aesthetic experience, and aesthetic judgments. Some consider aesthetics to be a synonym for the philosophy of art since Hegel, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. Many of its definitions include the idea that an object is beautiful if perceiving it is accompanied by aesthetic pleasure.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

I realize that the person who intends to put a soul to an adequate test to see whether it lives rightly or not must have three qualities, all of which you have: knowledge, goodwill, and frankness.\" Socrates outlines a problem about truth when it is misaligned from public opinion: \"you don't compel me; instead you produce many false witnesses against me and try to banish me from my property, the truth. For my part, if I don't produce you as a single witness to agree with what I'm saying, then I suppose I've achieved nothing worth mentioning concerning the things we’ve been discussing\" (472c). In the Phaedo, the discussion of suicide is related to Socrates' understanding of philosophy as a preparation for death and the immortality of the soul. Although the dialogue begins with a defense of the prohibition of suicide, it serves to set the agenda for the rest of the dialogue and explores the major concerns of the argument as a whole. Socrates argues against suicide by offering two arguments in favor of the prohibition of self-killing. These arguments have had a significant influence on subsequent discussions about suicide, especially in theist contexts. However, it is important to note that Socrates does not necessarily endorse these arguments himself. The discussion of suicide is closely linked to Socrates' conception of true philosophy as a \"preparation for death.\" For Socrates, philosophy involves contemplating and preparing for the afterlife. This interpretation suggests that Socrates views philosophy as a means of understanding the immortality of the soul and preparing for the transition to the next life. Socrates argues that the soul is distinct from the body and that it continues to exist even after death. Overall, the discussion of suicide in the Phaedo is intertwined with Socrates' understanding of philosophy as a preparation for death and the immortality of the soul. Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point: someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally. The path he prescribes is that \n\n In some of Plato's dialogues, Socrates proposes that phronēsis is a necessary condition for all virtue. In Plato's Meno, Socrates explains how phronēsis, a quality synonymous with moral understanding, is the most important attribute to learn, although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the development of the understanding of one's own self.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be \n\n Kant thinks that, with the exception of the good will, all goods are qualified. For example, wealth can be extremely good if it is used for human welfare, but it can be disastrous if a corrupt mind is behind it. In a similar vein, we often desire intelligence and take it to be good, but we certainly would not take the intelligence of an evil genius to be good. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief”, and having entirely lost his will to live, yet obeys his duty to preserve his life. Kant also notes that many individuals possess an inclination to do good; but however commendable such actions may be, they do not have moral worth when they are done out of pleasure. Kant states that this is how we should understand the Scriptural command to love even one's enemy: love as inclination or sentiment cannot be commanded, only rational love as duty can be. Kant's three significant formulations of the categorical imperative are: Kant argued that the only absolutely good thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. In his essay, On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns, arguing against the position of Benjamin Constant, Des\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Beauty for Plato is a particularly important type of universal. For Plato the argument for a timeless idea of beauty does not involve so much whether the gods exist (Plato was not a monotheist) but rather whether there is an immaterial \n\n Influenced by Sigmund Freud, psychotherapists have turned to Greek philosophy for an understanding of eros' heightened aesthetic. For Plato, Eros takes an almost transcendent manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the object/other: \"the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty\". Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle's ontology places the universal (katholou) in particulars (kath' hekaston), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. In the Symposium the notion of the beautiful soul is introduced as more valuable than material beauty. Within Plato's framework, these pure forms of reality are determined by a demiurge, but the Christian interpretation of Plato by Augustine and Dionysius holds that the forms mirror the perfection of God's own mind. This notion underlies the more significant notion of mimesis, whereby art and material beauty are considered the mere reflection of the beauty of that realm.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

In chapter 13, Aristotle discerns what combination of change of fortune, or μετάβασις (metabasis) and character will create fear and pity, which turns out to involve a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle finds that none of the three creates both fear and pity, and instead, the tragic hero should be ethically like the average person--not completely good or bad but a mean between the \n\n The ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., \"when something that was dignified is reduced to aridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughteris most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'.\" For Aristotle, we laugh at inferior or ugly individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them. He describes misfortune in tragedy, δυστυχία (dustuchia \"adversity, misfortune\") as \"to suffer or inflict terrible disasters\" (1453a21), Aristotle then mentions that \"so many\" of Euripides's \"plays end in misfortune.\" In chapter 14, Aristotle considers the most \"dreadful or rather pitiable\" deed, \"when for instance brother kills brother, or son father, or mother son, or son mother—either kills or intends to kill, or does something of the kind, that is what we must look for\" (1453b20-21). After naming them, he ranks them: \"The worst of these is to intend the action with full knowledge and not to perform \n\n than phronesis, the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, because phronesis facilitates sophia. He also associates phronesis with political ability. According to Aristotle's theory of rhetoric, phronesis is one of the three types of appeal to character (ethos).

However, it is important to consider the reliability of conceivability as a guide to possibility. The reliability of conceivability as a guide to possibility is not fully established, as our ability to conceive of certain scenarios may be influenced by various factors such as our cognitive limitations, linguistic constraints, or lack of complete knowledge about the nature of consciousness. One way empirical facts can contribute is by diminishing the power of anti-physicalist arguments, such as Chalmers' \"conceivability argument\" and Jackson's \"knowledge argument.\" These arguments claim that consciousness cannot be fully explained by physical processes alone. However, empirical discoveries can challenge these arguments by demonstrating how physical phenomena and brain processes are intricately linked to conscious experiences. Such empirical findings contribute to our understanding of how consciousness emerges from the neural processes in our brains. In this sense there would be a gap between the outside perspective of science and the internal perspective of phenomenal experience. Levine does not believe this gap necessitates a metaphysical conclusion; that is, he does not believe his argument refutes materialism. However, he believes it poses a unique epistemic problem: \"While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.\" This was based on developments in neuroscience. However, physicalist theories of mind have had to grapple with the issue of subjective experience raised by Thomas Nagel in What Is It Like to Be a Bat? and Frank Cameron Jackson's so-called knowledge argument. David Chalmers also argued against physicalism in the philosophical zombie argument. He further noted that subjective experience posed the hard problem of consciousness. The inability of physicalist theories to explain conscious feeling has been termed the explanatory gap. In contrast, Daniel Dennett has claimed that no such gap exists as subjective experiences are a 'philosophical fiction'.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be \n\n One of Rawls’ most significant contributions to sociology is her theory of interaction order. In an influential 1987 article published in Sociological Theory, Rawls builds on Goffman’s argument that \"Interaction order\" is the sui generis site where meaning, self, and other social objects are achieved. Rawls' work on interaction order also builds on Emile Durkheim's (1893/1933) argument that society consists of social facts that must be continually made through constitutive practices in interaction (see below), Immanuel Kant's (1783) Kingdom of Ends, and Harold Garfinkel's (1967) specification of constitutive practices and their conditions of possibility in social interaction, which Garfinkel (1963) calls Trust Conditions. Theories of luck egalitarianism were foreshadowed by 20th-century philosopher John Rawls’ theory of distributive justice in which he observed that a person’s skills and abilities led to differential distributive justice outcomes. Rawls argued that this is unfair because one’s natural talents or circumstances are morally arbitrary as they have been determined by a “natural lottery” rather than one's own choices. In more recent work, Rawls develops her position that social justice is central to Durkheim’s work. Instead, meaning \n\n In A Theory of Justice, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Singer asserts that if all beings, not just humans, are included as having interests that must be considered, then the principle of equal consideration of interests opposes not only racism and sexism, but also speciesism. Jeremy Bentham argued that a being's capacity to suffer is what is morally relevant when considering their interests, not their capacity for reason. According to him, moral constructivism searches for reasonable grounds whereas deontological judgements rely on hasty and emotional responses. Singer argues our most immediate moral intuitions should be challenged. Our first intuitive reaction is a firm condemnation of incest as morally wrong. of what we consider moral progress can be viewed as, in large part, the replacement of hierarchical worldviews with a presumption in favor of forms of egalitarianism. \"The claim that rationality should be prerequisite for moral consideration is challenged by Sapontzis, who argues that the experience of pain is not greater if an individual is more intelligent and that the opposite may well be the case, as individuals who \n\nThe principles of medical ethics can guide clinical practice and ensure the provision of quality care to patients. The four main principles of medical ethics are autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. Nonmaleficence focuses on avoiding harm to patients, while beneficence emphasizes the need to actively promote their well-being. The principle of nonmaleficence is crucial in clinical practice to avoid harm to patients. By adhering to these principles, clinicians can navigate the complex moral landscape of medicine and prioritize the well-being and autonomy of their patients. Deontological judgements linked to emotional and intuitive responses were developed by human beings as they were confronted with personal and close interactions with others. In the past century, our social organizations were altered and so these types of interactions have become less frequent. Therefore, Singer argues that we should rely on more sophisticated consequentialist judgements that fit better in our modern times than the deontological judgements that were useful for more rudimentary interactions.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

He sarcastically compliments Callicles on his frankness because it helps expose the truth about oratory: \"I well know that if you concur with what my soul believes, then that is the very truth. I realize that the person who intends to put a soul to an adequate test to see whether it lives rightly or not must have three qualities, all of which you have: knowledge, goodwill, and frankness.\" Socrates outlines a problem about truth when it is misaligned from public opinion: \"you don't compel me; instead you produce many false witnesses against me and try to banish me from my property, the truth. The Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470–399 BC) said that intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or [what is] best, just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that virtue is a matter of the intellect, because virtue and Knowledge are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to the use of Reason. Socrates's definition of moral intellectualism is a basis of the philosophy of Stoicism, wherein the consequences of that definition are called “Socratic paradoxes”, such as “There is no weakness of will”, because a person either knowingly does evil or knowingly seeks to do evil (moral \n\n Apollophanes' natural philosophy is similar to Poseidonius', that the world is one and finite, having a spherical form with a vacuum around it. On the number of virtues Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and Antipater suggest that there are many; Poseidonius suggests that there are four; traditional Stoics suggest that there are three (the logical, the natural, and the ethical); Panaetius teaches that there are only two (the speculative and the practical); while Apollophanes taught that there is only one virtue - prudence. He teaches, however, that pleasure is to be understood in an overarching sense wherein fleeing battle is a momentary pleasure that detracts from the greater pleasure of acting bravely. However, it is important to note that Socrates does not necessarily endorse these arguments himself. For Socrates, philosophy involves contemplating and preparing for the afterlife. This interpretation suggests that Socrates views philosophy as a means of understanding the immortality of the soul and preparing for the transition to the next life.

Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons. First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people \n\n Kant believes that all of our actions, whether motivated by inclination or morality, must follow some law. He concludes that the only remaining alternative \n\n can determine whether a maxim of lying to secure a loan is moral by attempting to universalize it and applying reason to the results. Kant calls such acts examples of a contradiction in conception, which is much like a performative contradiction, because they undermine the very basis for their existence. Kant's notion of universalizability has a clear antecedent in Rousseau's idea of a general will. Thus, Kant argues that one should not lie under any circumstance. Another example would be if trying to decide whether suicide is moral or immoral; imagine if everyone committed suicide. Kant then asks why we have to follow the principle of morality. Although we all may feel the force of our consciences, Kant, examining phenomena with a philosophical eye, is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so.” He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws,” but wonders how this is possible.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

In ethics, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. Other philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes and David Gauthier, have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims—that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so \n\n1) Consequentialist ethics, or theories holding that normative properties of acts depend only on consequences. The paradigm consequentialist family of theories is utilitarianism, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends on whether that act maximizes some sort of net good. This theory's main developments came from Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality. Later developments have also adjusted the theory, most notably Henry Sidgwick who introduced the idea of motive or intent in morality, and Peter Singer who introduced the idea of preference in moral decision making. ; 2) Deontological ethics, notions based on \n\n Thomas Nagel has argued that Joshua Greene, in his book Moral Tribes, is too quick to conclude utilitarianism specifically from the general goal of constructing an impartial morality; for example, he says, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls offer other impartial approaches to ethical questions. But he also claims that people have a tendency to see facts in a way that serves their ingroup, even if there's no disagreement about the underlying moral principles that govern the disputes. Kant, for example, has been criticized for defining morality in terms of the formal feature of being a \"universal law\", and then attempting to derive from this formal feature various concrete moral duties.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

She was a prominent figure of analytical Thomism, a Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. Anscombe was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein and became an authority on his work and edited and translated many books drawn from his writings, above all his Philosophical Investigations. Anscombe's 1958 article \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" introduced the term consequentialism into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary virtue ethics. German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an argument from morality based on practical reason. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the summum bonum) and believed that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this. In his book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis argued that \"conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver.\" Often, they consider that morality seems to be binding – obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference, but imply that the obligation will stand, regardless of other factors or \n\n account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. No human society today advocates immorality, \n\nWittgenstein's method of dismissing the Cartesian sceptic can also be applied to the problems posed by the 'moral sceptic', who denies the truth of all ethical or moral claims. Just as Wittgenstein's focus on public language enables us to dismiss the traditional problem of other minds, a focus on public moral practices or language-games allows us to dismiss the idea that moral claims are always meaningless, false, or nonsensical. In this context, the moral sceptic is misguided in a similar way to the solipsist who implicitly admits the existence of other minds in their practices. The moral sceptic, by engaging in moral activities, implicitly acknowledges the existence of meaningful moral positions.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Both Bentham and Mill thus endorse \"classical\" or \"hedonistic\" forms of utilitarianism. In particular, Mill tried to develop a more refined form of utilitarianism that would harmonize better with ordinary morality and highlight the importance in the ethical life of intellectual pleasures, self-development, high ideals of character, and conventional moral rules. Mario Bunge writes about negative utilitarianism in his Treatise on Basic Philosophy but in a different sense than most others. The term \"negative utilitarianism\" was introduced by R. N. Smart in his 1958 reply to Karl Popper's book The Open Society and Its Enemies, published in 1945. In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy. The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism. Ancient Greek philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene has been said to be \"one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].\" In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist Edmund Gurney who wrote: \"Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability ... of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer ... in the negative.... It can be considered as a version of utilitarianism that gives greater priority to reducing suffering (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing pleasure (positive utility). Negative utilitarianism would thus differ from other consequentialist views, such as \n\n1) that feelings of justice are rooted in both a natural human desire to retaliate for injuries and a natural instinct for sympathy for those who have been wrongly injured; ; 2) that justice has a utilitarian basis since an injustice is committed only when a person's rights have been violated, and an alleged right should be protected by society only when doing so promotes the general happiness; ; 3) that people disagree deeply about what sorts of things are and are not just, and utilitarianism provides the only rational basis for resolving such conflicts.

According to Berkeley, God is the entity who controls everything, yet Berkeley also argued that \"abstract object[s] do not exist in space or time\". In other words, as Warnock argues, Berkeley \"had recognized that he could not square with his own talk of spirits, of our minds and of God; for these are perceivers and not among objects of perception. He was a British empiricist, an immaterialist, and an idealist. Many of his most important ideas were first put forth in A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, a work which was critical of John Locke's philosophy. Berkeley agreed with Locke that there was an outside world which caused the ideas within the mind, but Berkeley sought to prove that the outside world was also composed solely of ideas. Berkeley thought that the ideas that we possessed could only resemble other ideas (not physical objects) and thus the external world consisted not of physical form, but rather of ideas. Berkeley is famous for his motto \"esse est percipi aut percipere\", or otherwise, \"to exist is to be perceived, or to perceive\". Egocentric predicament, a term coined by Ralph Barton Perry in an article (Journal of Philosophy 1910), is the problem of not being able to view reality outside of our own perceptions. Since 1710, when George Berkeley broached in his fashion the problem of the egocentric predicament, denying \n\n or not external objects are given, and we can only know their existence as a mere appearance. Samuel Johnson is well known for his \"refutation\" of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, \"I refute it thus!\" Both Perry's concept and the term he used influenced American philosopher, Everett W. Hall to create the solecism \"the categorio-centric predicament\" to express the impossibility of seeing the world outside the \"categories\" imposed by one's native language and conceptual scheme.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be \n\n Political Liberalism is a 1993 book by the American philosopher John Rawls, an update to his earlier A Theory of Justice (1971). In it, he attempts to show that his theory of justice is not a \"comprehensive conception of the good\" but is instead compatible with a liberal conception of the role of justice, namely, that government should be neutral between competing conceptions of the good. Rawls tries to show that his two principles of justice, properly understood, form a \"theory of the right\" (as opposed to a theory of the good) which would be supported by all reasonable individuals, even under conditions of reasonable pluralism. fairness, and justice. Therefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. Rawls (1999) outlined his ‘justice as fairness’ with two principles: that each person has the equal right \n\n In A Theory of Justice, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality that is meant to apply to the basic structure of a well-ordered society. Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

He was a \"subjective idealist\" or \"empirical idealist\", who believed that reality is constructed entirely of immaterial, conscious minds and their ideas; everything that exists is somehow dependent on the subject perceiving it, except the subject themselves. He refuted the \n\n intelligibly suppose that it could be material. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial. Ian Barbour, in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p. 133, cites Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for \"the defense of the idea of human freedom\" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical \n\n inferred that a materialistic metaphysics was outmoded and that, in consequence, since the disjunction of materialism or idealism are assumed to be exhaustive, an idealistic metaphysics is required. The second, and more interesting argument, was based on Eddington's epistemology, and may be regarded as consisting of two parts. We therefore have no reason to doubt that the objective world too is \"mind-stuff\". It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.\" - Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World, 276–81.

He states that his \n\n judgements. According to him, moral constructivism searches for reasonable grounds whereas deontological judgements rely on hasty and emotional responses. Singer argues our most immediate moral intuitions should be challenged. He gives the example of a brother and sister who secretly decide to have sex with each other using contraceptives. Our first intuitive reaction is a firm condemnation of incest as morally wrong. As the brother and sister did not tell anyone and they used contraceptives, the incest did not have any harmful consequences. Like euthanasia, there is world-wide public controversy and ethical debate over the moral, philosophical and religious issues of child euthanasia. While engaged in this pursuit, Dr. Verhagen publicly stated that he terminated the lives of four more infants, all with severe cases of spina bifida. He felt that strict regulations on infant euthanasia would prevent uncontrolled and unjustified instances of euthanasia. The infant must be experiencing hopeless and unbearable suffering. Infants who have a hopeless prognosis and experience unbearable suffering. Ethical debate\nThe concept of child euthanasia has sparked heavy debate. The ethical debate can be broken down into two categories:\nEuthanasia reserved for neonates and infants. Rather, the protocol was created to relieve the burden that both the infant and its parents would face in a \"life of agonizing pain.\" Others, such as Joseph Fletcher, founder of situational ethics and a euthanasia proponent, proposed that infanticide be permitted in cases of severe birth defects. Fletcher says that unlike the sort of infanticide perpetrated by very disturbed people, in such cases child euthanasia could be considered humane; a logical and acceptable extension of abortion. Bioethicists Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva go one step further, arguing that killing a newborn \"should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled.\" He claims that nowhere in the protocol does it mention only pertaining to terminally-ill infants and the developers of the protocol value the future quality of life more than the current being of the infant. Eric Kodish and Daniel A. Beals have compared child euthanasia to infanticide. Kodish says \"the very notion that there is an “accepted medical standard” for infanticide calls for resistance in the form of civil disobedience.\" Dr. Alexander A. Kon, a national leader in pediatric critical care medicine and bioethics at University of California San Diego School of Medicine, outlines that the ethical implications for neonatal euthanasia lies in the lack of \"self-determination\" for infants compared to adults. Kon states, therefore, justification must solely be on the basis of the patient's well-being. Though not asserting his position on the Groningen Protocol, Kon's concerns center around the use of paralytic agents in Verhagen's infants. American bioethicist Jacob M. Appel argues that pediatric euthanasia may be ethical even in the absence of parental consent. Luc Bovens, professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics, explains the three fields of thought opposing this amendment to the 2002 Euthanasia Act. Bovens outlines the five most used arguments in support of this third point:\nWeightiness: We do not allow minors to vote or buy cigarettes, so why should we allow them to make decisions about life and death? Capability of Discernment: Minors are not capable of judging what is best for them. Sensitivity: Wishing to satisfy parental expectations or reduce parental stress, minors will opt for euthanasia. Verhagen supports this, with the claim that an age restriction of a certain number of years is arbitrary in nature, and that \"self-determination knows no age limit.\" Physician sentiment\nA major challenge for physicians tasked with the medical decision-making of babies born very premature or severely disabled with neurological damage and poor quality of life for the future presents another side to the bioethics topic of child euthanasia. Religious views\n\nMorals derived through religious scripts and teachings largely influence views on euthanasia. A recent psychological study in Belgium showed that people who disapprove the legalization of child euthanasia tend to be religious, have low flexibility in existential issues, endorse collectivistic morality (values of loyalty and purity), and/or express ingroup-oriented prosocial inclinations. Buddhism\n\nBuddhist views are not in favor of the intentional ending of life. The Dalai Lama explains all life has \"precious\" value, with human life being the most valuable. According to the Dalai Lama, abortion is an act of killing within traditional Buddhist views, yet we must judge each instance on a case-by-case basis. He cites an example where a woman with pregnancy complications could result in two deaths rather than just the baby's if no intervention is done. The Dalai Lama expands the idea of \"exceptional circumstances\" to a case where a person is a coma with no chance of recovering his or her pre-coma condition. Catholicism\nIn 1995, Pope John Paul II spoke on matters concerning the moral evaluation of prenatal diagnostic techniques which allow for the early detection of abnormalities in the unborn fetus, siding with traditional Catholic views on life. Pope John Paul II continued by stating that  foregoing extraordinary means to save one's life is not the equivalent of euthanasia, but rather an acceptance of the delicate balance of human life. He summarizes, \"human life, as a gift from God, is sacred and inviolable. He called for more thought into balancing medical efforts to prolong life and withholding those same efforts when death seems inevitable. Pope Francis echoed Pope John Paul II's remarks on suspending medical procedures beyond conventional means and reaffirmed that euthanasia is always wrong, being that its intention is to end life. Hinduism\nHinduism allows for multiple interpretations on the concept of euthanasia. The majority of Hindus believe doctors should not fulfill requests for euthanasia, as it will damage the karma of both parties. Yet, some Hindus believe that the act of ending a painful life is rather a good deed. In a 2012 study centered around Hindu college students and their views on ending the lives of severely disabled neonates, it was found that 38% had no firm opinion on the acceptability of terminating these lives. Islam\nIslam forbids any form of euthanasia, as it is determined by God how long a person lives. Life is a sacred thing bestowed upon humans by God. The aforementioned 2012 study involving Hindu university students also analyzed the same measures of 150 Muslim students. The study found that, in accordance with the teachings of Islam, the Muslim students were more likely to oppose the purposeful termination of the damaged neonates. Judaism\nYoel Jakobovits, a devout Orthodox Jewish physician who holds academic positions at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, summarizes the religious Jewish attitudes that appear to govern the topic of neonatal euthanasia. Jakobovits states that all human life is valuable, irrespective of potential disabilities or impairments and actively forfeiting life by any means would constitute murder. Lastly, withholding of nutrition, oxygen and blood is forbidden in Judaism. However, a child must ask for the procedure and verify that they understand what will happen. However, Eduard Verhagen has documented several cases of infant euthanasia. This Protocol prompted a very critical response from Elio Sgreccia, the head of the Pontifical Academy for Life. The College stated that there should be discussion over whether \"deliberate intervention\" to cause death in severely disabled newborn babies should be legalised; it stated that while it was not necessarily in favour of the move, it felt the issues should be debated. The Church of England submission to the enquiry supported the view that doctors should be given the right to withhold treatment from seriously disabled newborn babies in exceptional circumstances, and the Christian Medical Fellowship stated that when treatment would be \"a burden\" this was not euthanasia.

Singer relies on evolutionary theories to justify his claim. For most of our evolutionary history, human beings have lived in small groups where violence was ubiquitous. Deontological judgements linked to emotional and intuitive responses were developed by human beings as they were confronted with personal and close interactions with others. In the past century, our social organizations were altered and so these types of interactions have become less frequent. Therefore, Singer argues that we should rely on more sophisticated consequentialist judgements that fit better in our modern times than the deontological judgements that were useful for more rudimentary interactions. therefore they leave room for more accurate and analytical judgement of the situation. Thus, according to this argument, unlike consequentialist intuitions, emotion-based deontological intuitions are the side effects of this evolutionary adaption to the pre-existing environment. Moreover, he argues that the invitation, advanced by Singer, to separate evolutionary-based moral judgements (allegedly unreliable) from those that are based on reason, is misleading because it is based on a false dichotomy.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

(Hume 1974:324) In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world:  He shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since \"it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change\") nor experience (since that would be a circular argument).

(Hume 1974:356-359) Having dispensed with these alternative explanations, he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances.

While it is commonly thought that Darrow \"switched sides\" to represent Debs, a myth repeated by Irving Stone's biography, Clarence Darrow For the Defense, he had in fact resigned from the railroad earlier, after the death of his mentor William Goudy. Scopes was charged on May 5, 1925 with teaching evolution from a chapter in a textbook which showed ideas developed from those set out in Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species. The trial pitted two of the pre-eminent legal minds of the time against one another; three-time presidential candidate, Congressman and former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan headed up the prosecution and prominent trial attorney Clarence Darrow spoke for the defense. In 1968 the United States Supreme Court invalidated a forty-year-old Arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of evolution in the public schools. A Little Rock, Arkansas, high-school-biology teacher, Susan Epperson, filed suit, charging that the law violated the federal constitutional prohibition against establishment of religion as set forth in the Establishment Clause. The Little Rock Ministerial Association supported Epperson's challenge, declaring, \"to use the Bible to support an irrational and an archaic concept of static and undeveloping creation is not only to misunderstand the meaning of the Book of Genesis, but to do God and religion a disservice by making both enemies of scientific advancement and academic freedom\". What was the impetus for entering the field of Hospice and Palliative Medicine? It was clearly obvious to me during my medical school years and residency (1980’s) that many patients that were terminally-ill with cancer, AIDS (1980s was the advent of HIV), very debilitated elderly patients and vegetative patients with no chance for quality of life, were being kept alive without treatment of their emotional, spiritual, interpersonal and many times there physical pain. I knew there had to be some way to help these suffering patients die comfortably and with dignity. Since all doctors were busy with patients, I cared for the elderly gentleman who had a better chance of survival. Essentially, when I was caring for terminally ill AIDS and cancer patients in the hospital. At the end, most would rally with incredible energy and would tell their family and friends goodbye and at times describe their visions. After seeing hundred of patients dying, including murderers, Christians, Muslims, Atheists, Jews, and most claiming to see the same apparitions at similar times before their death, I knew there had to be more to the experiences that modern medicine had not been willing to research. When I began my research on PDEs, I found that the quest for facts to support the idea of post-mortem survival w over 2,000 years ago. The most well-known example being the pre-death experience of Jesus of Nazareth. He foresaw His death and resurrection and told of seeing and speaking to angels and deceased prophets, all which appeared to Him so as to help with His transition. Prior to His death and while on nailed to the cross, He left us with knowledge of hoe to live our life’s and how to die and what awaited us. What He explains is similar to the descriptions and messages that many of my patients leave with me. In the book, more is described. What other noted civilizations and people described the pre-death experience? The Egyptians, Sumerians and Plato describe pre-death experiences in their writings. The Romans, a second century Rabbi Yochar wrote about death bed visions in his book entitled The Book of Splendor. Abraham Lincoln told his best friend a dream of his death just days before he was assassinated. A twentieth-century well-known physicist named Sir William Barrett, who worked with the famous physicist Dr. Tindell studied this phenomenon and wrote a book in 1926 entitled Death Bed Visions – 1926. He described visions the dying described just days to hours before their death. These visions included deceased loved one and spiritual beings coming to guide them to the other-side. They are given much information with regards to their life, and close family members so they can make the transition to the next life or heaven as some patients call it. Can you describe the timing of these visions or non-linear conscious awareness? At times, patients claim to see God at the foot of the bed. He was so unselfish and spoke of his three angels he called Gabby, Raphy and Noe. He said they were quite large angels that were there to keep him from feeling pain and to fulfill his purpose for being born. He gave several prophecies about our world and my life. Did patients ever see hell or talk about the devil? Only a few, and most explained it as a self separation from God that comes from not being able to forgive oneself or love oneself as we are ready to transition. How do you propose to improve this lack of knowledge with regards to the process of dying? Dr. Bruce Grayson who is the director of the perceptual studies at the University of Virginia Medical School as well as Dr. Gary Schwartz out of The University of Arizona School of medicine. They are looking at biological markers, as well as EEG’s, pet scans, immunological markers and other brain Neurotransmitters, like dopamine, serotonin, Nor epinephrine and the latest being Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) located in the pineal gland and possibly related directly to the visions. Yet, the nurses as well as I and other physicians somehow are able to get the patients to tell us their visions. Also, if one is on hard narcotics like morphine, which I believe to be necessary for comfort, their minds maybe to relaxed to communicate. My patients have related to me that all humans have the latent ability but not all brains are fully evolved or have the right amount and balance of chemicals to initiate this ability. What do you feel will be the impact of the book’s message five years from now? The core essence of the book is one of Hope and enduring Love for All. Surprisingly, judgment does not play a big role in this message. You can speak of dying patients who have done ill will in their lives that they would be the ones judging themselves as told by many of my patients. So, self forgiveness and self love is so important. If we all do not try to help in some way, evolution and direct affects of mans actions on each other and our earth will take care of it sooner or later. I believe that humanity as a whole has reached the “fork in the road”, if you will. I believe that is why the book has been embraced by so many. I am just a simple witness to their testament. I believe there is a much Higher Purpose than I can ever imagine to these messages. What would you tell someone who is thinking of ending their life prematurely? I have had a few patients which have survived suicide and eventually changed their lives as a result of the spiritual visions they had. I too was skeptical and to this day have to remain quite objective and impassive, yet with a human caring heart, as patient’s lives hinge on my diagnosis and palliative treatment. Why do you feel the book has been embraced by so many? I have to admit I have not experienced a book and its message which has touched so many people at such a deep level whether they are religious or non-religious regardless of their race and creed. God knew that they were extremely depressed and that their brain chemistry was such that it felt leaving this world was the only option. They said that the angels told them that humans were wrong to condemnthem as the pain they were suffering was horrific. As far as what a few patients have told me is that some of us have the ability at this time and that as our brain evolves and we open our minds to this possibility thru meditation and prayer and so on….. we all will be able to have the ability. They told me this is beginning to happen as we speak and will occur with intensified frequency after 4 more years. I am writing about his very question in my 2nd book. I have attended 4 deaths. None of them acknowledged any of the entities that you suggest. Most visions last 3 to 4 seconds and discussion of those experiences usually ensues immediately after. Also, if one is on hard narcotics like morphine, which I believe to be necessary for comfort, their minds maybe to relaxed to communicate. I always wondered about forgiveness because thebible says to forgive and also because mediums say spirits have difficulties inthe afterlife when there is unfinished business. I have seen several people die who could not find it within themselves to find self forgiveness or self love as they had lived a life full of deceit, lies, hatred, vengeance, abuse, drug use….much of it ,if not all, stemming from family genetics. They would claim to see dark figures that would frighten them and remind them of all the darkness they had not only brought to themselves but to the world. Most of those patients did not listen to the angels as they did not feel worthy to forgive themselves and thus they chose to be separated 20from God. Many described going into an abyss or a cave that was full of other people who were murderers, abusers, leaders of countries that massacred people i.e., the Romans, Germans. It was horrifying to watch.I learned the only way to help these souls was to pray for them and to witness to them about Gods unconditional love and forgiveness. Over a period of time, many would find their way out and move towards the light at which point they would learn how to forgive and love.That is why it is so important to pray for those souls who have died and not close to God. I was told in order to move up the ladder of knowledge, if you will, is to learn to pray for others hat may have hurt you deeply. Is it common for patients to die without claiming to see spiritual entities? One example was a lawyer who had lost his son a year earlier and was quite worried because he had not seen angels or any other kind of spiritual being just one day before he died. At one hour before he died he finally saw his son and smiled and died. I truly believe that the brain needs to be functioning somewhat well in order to have visions with our physical eyes. He definitelydid not have enough blood moving towards his brains and thus eyes therefore, he saw blackness. How does one go about forgiving oneself before dying? I do not have the exact recipe, but I can tell you what my patients tell me: In their opinion, to forgive oneself, one must LIKE oneself….. And for the most part, most people do not like themselves. That is why they seek to always be connected to someone…because they cannot stand to live with the one person they don’t like themselves. Therefore, exercise, eat fairly well, go have fun, and make time to talk to God and help others, i.e. Clarence Darrow, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team.

Deontologists believe that ethical rules bind individuals to their duty or obligation. Consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, evaluate the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its outcomes and aim to maximize overall happiness or utility. Teleological theories also consider the end goal or purpose of an action in assessing its morality. While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. Ross proposed a more flexible deontological theory where the consequences can sometimes override certain duties. Overall, deontological ethics focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves and emphasizes fulfilling one's duty or obligation, while consequentialist and teleological ethical theories consider the outcomes and purposes of actions in determining their morality.

For instance, it is not possible for Brenda's killing of Charles to be right, and Sam's killing of \n\nDeontological ethics or deontology (Greek: δέον (deon) meaning 'obligation' or 'duty') is an approach to ethics that focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, as opposed to the rightness or wrongness of the consequences of those actions. It is sometimes described as \"duty\" or \"obligation\" based ethics, because deontologists believe that ethical rules \"bind you to your duty\". The term 'deontological' was first used in this way in 1930, in C. D. Broad's book, Five Types of Ethical Theory. However, it is also important to note that there is a difference between deontological ethics and moral absolutism. Deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that some actions are wrong no matter what consequences follow from them. Immanuel Kant, for example, famously argued that it is always wrong to lie – even if a murderer is asking for the location of a potential victim. Kant's and Ross's theories are discussed in more detail below.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
