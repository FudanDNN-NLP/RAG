The additive inverse −f of f in M(G) coincides with the natural pointwise definition, that is, (−f)(x) = −(f(x)) for all x in G. If G has at least 2 elements, M(G) is not a ring, even if G is abelian. (Consider a constant mapping g from G to a fixed element g ≠ 0 of G; then g⋅0 = g ≠ 0.) However, there is a subset E(G) of M(G) consisting of all group endomorphisms of G, \n\nIn set theory, an arbitrary permutation of the elements of a set X is an automorphism. The automorphism group of X is also called the symmetric group on X. ; In elementary arithmetic, the set of integers, Z, considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a ring, however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group G there is a natural group homomorphism G → \n\n The indicator or characteristic function of a subset A of some set X maps elements of X to the range {0, 1}. This mapping is surjective only when A is a non-empty proper subset of X. By a similar argument, if A ≡ ∅ then 1A = 0. In many cases, such as order theory, the inverse of the indicator function may be defined. Additionally, consider for instance the unit circle S, and the action on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations.

Then P is a polynomial in the derivative D, which in multi-index notation can be written This exhibits P as a Fourier multiplier. A more general class of functions p(x,ξ) which satisfy at most polynomial growth conditions in ξ under which this integral is well-behaved comprises the pseudo-differential operators. The Conway polynomial Cp,n is defined as the lexicographically minimal monic primitive polynomial of degree n over Fp that is compatible with Cp,m for all m dividing n. This is an inductive definition on n: the base case is Cp,1(x) = x − α where α is the lexicographically minimal primitive element of Fp. The notion of lexicographical ordering used is the following: Since there does not appear to be any natural mathematical criterion that would single out one monic primitive polynomial satisfying the compatibility conditions over all the others, the imposition of lexicographical ordering in the definition of the Conway polynomial should be regarded as a convention. If a and b viewed as elements of F[X] are not relatively prime, there is a greatest common divisor of a \n\n constant d is a common divisor in S of a and b; we shall show it is in fact a greatest common divisor by showing that it lies in aS + bS. Now one proves by induction on the leading monomial in lexicographic order, that any nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial P of degree d can be written as polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials. Since P is symmetric, its leading monomial has weakly decreasing exponents, so it is some X&thinsp;λ with λ a partition of d .\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

Let J be a line and B a point not on J. Let BST be a right angle which moves so that ST equals the distance from B to J and T remains on J, while the other leg BS slides along B. To see this, let the distance between B and J be 2a. Note that, as with the double projection construction, this can be adapted to produce a mechanical device that generates the curve. One example of an optimization problem is: Find the shortest curve between two points on a surface, assuming that the curve must also lie on the surface. If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the shortest path is not immediately clear. These paths are called geodesics, and one of the most fundamental problems in the calculus of variations is finding geodesics. Another example is: Find the smallest area surface filling in a closed curve in space. As an example, a curve with an arc length of 600 units that has an overall sweep of 6 degrees is a 1-degree curve: For every 100 feet of arc, the bearing changes by 1 degree. The radius of such a curve is 5729.57795. No such function exists around point B, where the tangent space is vertical.]] In a less technical language, implicit functions exist and can be differentiated, if the curve has a non-vertical tangent. The theorem can be formulated effectively.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

So I is a ring with unity, and a \"subring-without-unity\", but not a \"subring-with-unity\" of Z × Z. ; The proper ideals of Z have no multiplicative identity. Proper ideals are subrings (without unity) that are closed under both left and right multiplication by elements of R. If one omits the requirement that rings have a unity element, then subrings need only be non-empty and otherwise conform to the ring structure, and ideals become subrings. Ideals may or may not have their own multiplicative identity (distinct from the identity of the ring): If I is a prime ideal of a commutative ring R, then the intersection of I with any subring S of R remains prime in S. In this case one says that I lies over I ∩ S. The situation is more complicated when R is not commutative.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

Every linear subspace W of V is a union of lines. If p(v) and p(w) are two different points of P(V) , the vectors v and w are linearly independent. It follows that: P(V) and P(V) is a projective subspace if and only if, given any two different points, it contains the whole projective line passing through these points. In synthetic geometry, where projective lines are primitive objects, the first property is an axiom, and the second one is the definition of a projective subspace.

Every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is relatively compact. Every compact subset of a (possibly non-Hausdorff) topological vector space is complete and relatively compact. In the case of a metric topology, or more generally when sequences may be used to test for compactness, the criterion for relative compactness becomes that any sequence in Y has a subsequence convergent in X. Some major theorems characterize relatively compact subsets, in particular in function spaces. Any finite topological space, including the empty set, is compact.
