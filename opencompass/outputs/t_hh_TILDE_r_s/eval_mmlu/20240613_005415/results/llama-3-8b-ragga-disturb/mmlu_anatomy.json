A lesion in or outside the stylomastoid foramen can result in flaccid paralysis of all the muscles of facial expression on the affected side. If you are experiencing any symptoms of peripheral facial paralysis, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. A condition referred to as \" **crocodile tear syndrome** \" (lacrimation while eating) may result as follows.A unilateral lesion of the facial nerve proximal to the geniculate ganglion causes loss of tear formation by the ipsilateral lacrimal gland.As the individual attempts to close the eyes, the eye on the affected side deviates up and out.Since both parotid glands (innervated by a different cranial nerve) and the contralateral sublingual and submandibular glands remain functional, it is difficult to determine from salivary action alone whether there is an interruption of the parasympathetic innervation to the ipsilateral submandibular and sublingual glands. **Bell's palsy** may be idiopathic, or result following trauma or viral infection of the facial nerve within the facial canal or near its exit from the stylomastoid foramen. A viral infection that affects the facial nerve's connective tissue coverings causes inflammation (neuritis) and edema. The swelling compresses the enclosed nerve fibers as they course through the facial canal, a narrow chanel, in the petrous portion of the temporal bone and as they exit from the stylomastoid foramen. Compression of the nerve results in ischemia and compromised conduction of the facial nerve fibers. A condition referred to as \" **crocodile tear syndrome** \" (lacrimation while eating) may result as follows.The fibers then establish inappropriate synaptic contacts with postganglionic (\"lacrimation\") neurons whose fibers project to the lacrimal gland.When the individual is eating, tears are produced by the lacrimal gland ipsilateral to the side of the lesion. Limb abnormalities—clubbed feet, missing fingers or toes ; Chest-wall abnormalities (Poland syndrome) ; Crossed eyes (strabismus) ; Difficulty in breathing and/or in swallowing ; Corneal erosion resulting from difficulty in blinking People with Möbius syndrome are born with facial paralysis and the inability to move their eyes laterally. A primary brainstem lesion affecting the motor nucleus of the facial nerve would result in ipsilateral (same side) weakness of the entire face. The geniculate ganglion, which the nerve passes through, can also be a site of pathology. Finally, the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen and enters the parotid gland, where it gives rise to multiple branches that supply muscles in the face. Understanding the location and nature of the lesion along the course of the facial nerve is crucial in determining the appropriate treatment and management for facial nerve dysfunction. Reference: Adapted from \"The complexity of the facial nerve [VII] is demonstrated by the different pathological processes and sites at which these processes occur. It enters the parotid gland and gives rise to five terminal groups of branches that supply muscles in the face and a number of additional branches that supply deeper or more posterior muscles.\" The possible causes of Bell's palsy include trauma, viral infection of the facial nerve, or it may be idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. In the case of viral infection, the inflammation (neuritis) and swelling of the facial nerve's connective tissue coverings can lead to compression of the enclosed nerve fibers as they pass through the facial canal and exit from the stylomastoid foramen. This compression results in ischemia and compromised conduction of the facial nerve fibers, leading to facial weakness or paralysis. In addition to facial weakness or paralysis, other symptoms of Bell's palsy may include drooping of the mouth and eyelid, difficulty closing one eye, loss of sense of taste on the front two-thirds of the tongue, hypersensitivity to sound in one ear, and increased or decreased tear production. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of Bell's palsy. Treatment may involve medications to reduce inflammation, protect the nerve, and manage symptoms, as well as physical therapy exercises to prevent muscle atrophy and maintain facial mobility.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

While muscle hypertrophy is a well-known characteristic of acromegaly, it is important to note that this condition is also associated with several other symptoms and complications. One significant aspect of acromegaly is the overgrowth of bones, which can lead to joint pain, limited joint mobility, and an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis. Acromegaly is also associated with various metabolic disturbances. In addition to these systemic effects, acromegaly can also impact the respiratory system. The enlargement of the facial bones and soft tissues can lead to obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep due to narrow or blocked airways. These include bone overgrowth, cardiovascular complications, metabolic disturbances, and respiratory issues. Additionally, having a portion of the mandible removed due to cancer can lead to a receding chin. Certain dental problems may also contribute to chin recession. Mandibular advancement surgery stimulates bone growth through external forces, while bilateral sagittal split osteotomy involves splitting and advancing the mandible forward to make the chin more prominent. Specialists are usually able to identify signs of macrodontia upon first glance also given the irregularity in appearance of the tooth in reference to other teeth present as well as what is expected for a patient in terms of tooth size given their age and gender. There are a number of symptoms that come with macrodontia, including: \n\nMental retardation is not associated with gigantism/acromegaly. Gigantism and acromegaly are both conditions that result from excessive production of growth hormone (GH) in the body, typically caused by a pituitary tumor. This condition usually appears during childhood or adolescence, resulting in abnormally tall stature. Acromegaly, on the other hand, occurs when excess GH is produced after the closure of the growth plates, leading to an enlargement of certain body parts. Symptoms of acromegaly may include enlarged hands and feet, facial changes such as a protruding jaw or enlarged nose, as well as joint pain and organ enlargement. While gigantism and acromegaly can have various effects on different aspects of health, mental retardation is not one of them. Early diagnosis and treatment of gigantism and acromegaly are essential to managing these conditions effectively. Individuals with acromegaly often experience a range of symptoms. Some common physical signs include enlarged hands and feet, facial changes such as a protruding jaw, thickened skin, enlarged nose and lips, and enlarged tongue. It's important to note that acromegaly is distinct from gigantism, which occurs when excessive growth hormone is produced during childhood or adolescence, leading to abnormal growth and an individual becoming significantly taller than their peers. Acromegaly, on the other hand, develops during adulthood. If you suspect you may have acromegaly or are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned, it is crucial to seek medical attention for diagnosis and appropriate management.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

Each of these components has specific functions that work together to ensure proper urine flow and waste removal. The ureters are thin tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. They act as a conduit, ensuring the transport of urine from the kidneys into the bladder. As the bladder fills with urine, its elastic and flexible walls expand. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body during urination. This mechanism is important in maintaining proper urine flow and preventing urinary tract infections. The ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, which acts as a reservoir. The bladder, with its expanding and contractile walls, stores and expels urine through the urethra. Together, these components work harmoniously to ensure proper urine flow and waste removal. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Those with long-term problems are at risk of urinary tract infections. The urinary system in humans consists of several components, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. After the kidneys filter waste products and excess water from the blood, the resulting liquid waste is called urine. The urine then travels through two thin tubes called ureters, which connect each kidney to the bladder. The ureters transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder for temporary storage. The bladder is a muscular organ that stores urine until it is ready to be eliminated from the body. It expands as it fills with urine and contracts when it's time to empty. When urination occurs, muscles surrounding the bladder relax while those in the urethra (a tube connecting the bladder to an external opening) contract.

Histologically, they have a coiled structure composed of stacked, disk-like lamellar cells. They are larger and more complex compared to eccrine sweat glands. Histologically, they have similar coiled structures, but with a larger lumen and more extensive duct system compared to eccrine glands. Histologically, hairs consist of three main layers: the medulla, cortex, and cuticle. The medulla is the central core, the cortex surrounds the medulla, and the cuticle is the outermost layer. In addition to skin appendages, there are sensory structures within the skin that are responsible for detecting different sensations:\n\n1. Histologically, Meissner corpuscles consist of specialized nerve endings wrapped with Schwann cells. Pacinian Corpuscles: These sensory pressure receptors are located in the dermis deep region. Histologically, Pacinian corpuscles are coiled, spring-like structures composed of stacked, disk-like lamellar cells. Histologically, free nerve endings are unencapsulated nerve endings that are distributed in the dermis and epidermis. These are some of the histological features and functions of skin appendages and sensory structures within the skin. The sebaceous glands secrete sebum into hair follicles.Specialized sweat glands in the armpits and the genital region (apocrine sweat glands) secrete a thick, oily sweat that produces a characteristic body odor when the sweat is digested by the skin bacteria in those areas.As sweat evaporates off the skin, it helps cool the body.Sweat is composed of water, salt, and other chemicals.Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color. The epidermis also contains Langerhans' cells, which are part of the skin's immune system. Dermis: The dermis, the skin's next layer, is a thick layer of fibrous and elastic tissue (made mostly of collagen, elastin, and fibrillin) that gives the skin its flexibility and strength. The dermis contains nerve endings, sweat glands and oil (sebaceous) glands, hair follicles, and blood vessels. For example, the fingertips and toes contain many nerves and are extremely sensitive to touch. The sebaceous glands secrete sebum into hair follicles.The hair follicles produce the various types of hair found throughout the body.Hair not only contributes to a person's appearance but has a number of important physical roles, including regulating body temperature, providing protection from injury, and enhancing sensation.A portion of the follicle also contains stem cells capable of regrowing damaged epidermis. Entosis (from Greek ἐντός entos, \"within\" and -ωσις -osis, \"disease\") is the invasion of a living cell into another cell's cytoplasm. Entotic cells, also referred to as cell-in-cell structures, are triggered by loss of attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). This internalization of one cell by another is dependent on adherens junctions, and is driven by a Rho-dependent process, involving actin polymerization and myosin II activity in the internalized cell. Adherens junctions bind cells together by linking cadherin transmembrane protein complexes of adjacent cells to the cytoskeleton. When certain cell types are detached from the ECM and have lost adhesion, the compaction force between neighboring cells can cause them to push into their neighbors, forming \n\nThe restoration of the epidermis over an abraded area is primarily attributed to the growth of epidermal cells from the hair follicles and sweat glands located in the dermis. These specialized structures house stem cells that play a crucial role in regenerating and renewing the epidermis. When the epidermis is damaged, the stem cells within the hair follicles and sweat glands become activated. The newly formed cells migrate towards the abraded area, guided by chemical signals and the underlying extracellular matrix. As they migrate, they undergo further maturation and specialization to eventually form a fully functional epidermis over the damaged area. It is important to note that while the growth of epidermal cells from hair follicles and sweat glands is the primary mechanism for the restoration of the epidermis, other cell types and processes also contribute to wound healing and regeneration. Overall, the growth of epidermis from hair follicles and sweat glands in the dermis plays a significant role in the restoration of the epidermis over abraded areas, ensuring the integrity and functionality of the skin. The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an afferent arteriole and leaves by an efferent arteriole. The capillaries consist of a tube lined by endothelial cells with a central lumen.

Lining\n\nCapillaries of the glomerulus are lined by endothelial cells. The glomerulus has a glomerular basement membrane consisting mainly of laminins, type IV collagen, agrin, and nidogen, which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes: thus, the glomerular basement membrane is sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes. It is outside the capillary lumen but surrounded by capillaries. It is contained by the basement membrane, which surrounds both the capillaries and the mesangium. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, whereas others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two-way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an efferent arteriole instead of a venule, as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular smooth muscle layer (tunica media). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal venule, which in turn enters a renal interlobular vein and then into the renal vein. Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the vasa recta, which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the renal medulla. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high hydrostatic pressure on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favor filtration to Bowman's capsule.

The basic functional and structural unit of the kidney is nephron, which is mainly composed of four components: the glomerulus, tubules, the collecting duct and peritubular capillaries. Looped nephrons contain the loop of Henle that continue down into the medulla then enter the distal tubule drain towards the ureter. The nephrons of avian species can not produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the blood, but the loop of Henle utilises countercurrent multiplication which allows it to become hyperosmotic in the collecting duct. This alternation of permeability between different sections of the ascending and descending loop allows for urine osmotic pressure to be elevated 2.5 times above the blood osmotic pressure.

Some neck or back injuries result in broken vertebrae, with no damage to the spinal nerves. In these situations, a brace or surgery may be required to keep the bones stable while they heal. Note: Spinal cord injury is very different from injuries such as fractured vertebrae, pinched nerves, spinal stenosis or ruptured disks. In the case of a spinal cord injury (SCI), the delicate bundle of nerves inside the vertebrae have been damaged. When this happens, communication between the brain and the rest of the body may be disrupted. Some of the diseases that can cause injury to the spinal cord include multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis, polio, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). A severe spinal cord injury often causes loss of good control over movement (paralysis) and / or loss of sensation. The Rehabilitation specialists will address these problems and work to prevent possible complications such as bladder or lung infections and pressure ulcers (bed sores). The majority of people who sustain a spinal cord injury are young adults between the ages of 16 and 30 because of riskier behaviors. What is a “complete” or “incomplete” spinal cord injury? A spinal cord injury is called “complete” when testing by the medical team indicates that the patient is unable to make any voluntary movement below the level of the injury. The injury is called “incomplete” when testing demonstrates that the patient is able to make some voluntary movement below the level of injury. What is meant by the “level” of a spinal cord injury? They do this because it provides a description of the severity of the injury. Generally, the higher up the injury is, the more severe the loss of function. A “quadriplegic” patient has a complete or incomplete injury at the cervical level. Lower down is the “thoracic” region. “Paraplegic” patients have an injury at or below this level. Below the lumbar region are the 5 sacral vertebrae (which are fused together) and 4 more fused vertebrae that make up the coccyx (tailbone). Note: Even though two patients may technically have the same level and type of injury (for example, “a complete T1 injury”), their degree of impairment and eventual recovery may be quite different, due to the extent of the damage and other complex factors. The most important thing to know is that each person’s recovery from spinal cord injury is different. ; Permanent impotence ; Sensory loss and/or numbness that is severe enough to not feel anything any more in the legs (not paralysis; movement is retained) ; Wound infection and meningitis - usually controlled with antibiotics ; Leakage of the spinal fluid through the wound, also repairable; the surgical team watches very closely post-surgery for this There is always abnormal sensitivity and tingling of the skin on the feet and legs after SDR because of the nature of the nerves that have been worked on, but this usually resolves within six weeks. He was eventually able to learn to breathe on his own without the diaphragmatic pacer \n\n People with a lesion at C7 have an impairment that effects the use of their hands and lower arm. People in this class have a total respiratory capacity of 79% compared to people without a disability. People with spinal injuries at T6 or higher are more likely to develop Autonomic dysreflexia (AD). Players in some sports like wheelchair rugby are encouraged to be particularly on guard for AD symptoms.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

The four abdominal quadrants are determined by a horizontal line and a vertical line that intersect at the umbilicus. On the other hand, the nine abdominal regions are defined as follows:\n\n1. Right hypochondriac region: Situated on the right side of the epigastric region, above the umbilicus, and contains the liver and gallbladder. Umbilical region: Located around the umbilicus or navel and contains the small intestine and transverse colon. Right lumbar region: Situated on the right side of the umbilical region and contains the ascending colon. Left lumbar region: Found on the left side of the umbilical region and contains the descending colon. Hypogastric region: Located in the lower middle part of the abdomen, below the umbilicus, and includes the urinary bladder and reproductive organs. Right iliac region: Situated on the right side of the hypogastric region and contains the cecum and appendix. These divisions are used to help pinpoint specific anatomical features and identify areas of abnormalities or disease processes within the abdomen. The lower opening of the thorax is formed by the twelfth thoracic vertebra behind, by the eleventh and twelfth ribs at the sides, and in front by the cartilages of the tenth, ninth, eighth, and seventh ribs, which ascend on either side and form an angle, the infrasternal angle or subcostal angle, into the apex of which the xiphoid process projects. The abdomen can be divided into quadrants using a vertical median plane and a horizontal transumbilical plane that passes through the umbilicus. The lower edge of the liver can be palpated below the right costal margin when the patient takes a deep breath. Additionally, the gallbladder is also located in this quadrant. Moving to the right lower quadrant, you can find the cecum and appendix. McBurney's point, which is one-third of the way up along a line from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus, is a common surface projection of the appendix. Another method involves dividing the abdomen into nine regions using sagittal and transverse planes. The three central regions are the epigastric, umbilical, and pubic regions, while the three regions on each side are the hypochondrium, flank, and groin regions. The pain from the abdominal part of the foregut is referred to the epigastric region, pain from the midgut is referred to the umbilical region, and pain from the hindgut is referred to the pubic region. Throughout this movement the scapula is rotated around the chest wall so that it moves 15 cm laterally and the glenoid cavity is rotated 40–45° in the horizontal plane. At this position, the lateral end of the clavicle is rotated posteriorly so that the angle at the acromioclavicular joint opens up slightly. Externally, the most prominent features of the heart are the right appendage (or right auricle), the sulcus terminalis, and the coronary sulcus. The sulcus terminalis, or terminal groove, is a shallow groove that travels from the IVC to the SVC and separates the right appendage from the venous compartment of the right ventricle. At the upper end of sulcus terminalis lies the sinoatrial node. The sinoatrial node receives blood supply from a branch of the right coronary artery or circumflex artery in 55% and 45% of people respectively.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

Loss of the physical barrier provided by the skin and mucous membranes predisposes to infection. Table 8–1 describes the organisms that commonly cause infections associated with the loss of these protective barriers. **TABLE 8–1 Damage to Skin and Mucous Membranes Predisposes to Infection Caused by Certain Bacteria**\n\nThe nonspecific protection in the gastrointestinal tract includes hydrolytic enzymes in saliva, acid in the stomach, and various degradative enzymes and macrophages in the small intestine. Additional protection in the gastrointestinal tract and in the lower respiratory tract is provided by **defensins**. These are highly positively charged (cationic) peptides that create pores in the membranes of bacteria, which kills them. Neutrophils and Paneth cells in the intestinal crypts contain one type of defensin (α-defensins), whereas the respiratory tract produces different defensins called β-defensins. The body has defence mechanisms that enable it  to resist microbial invasion of its tissues and give it a natural immunity or innate resistance against many microorganisms. Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. Our first line of defense is the skin ( **integument** ). The skin is an important first line of defense: a cut or an abrasion on the skin provides an entry point for pathogens into the body. The respiratory system also has mechanisms to prevent pathogens from entering the body. Several other mucous membranes, including around the eye and in the oral cavity, produce a nonspecific bacterial enzyme called **lysozyme** , which is secreted in tears and saliva, respectively. #### **Gastrointestinal Tract**\n\nThe **gastrointestinal** ( **GI** ) **tract** also plays a role in nonspecific immunity.In addition, the gut also is colonized by bacteria.Most of these bacteria lack the necessary characteristics to cause infection.Because there is already such a large bacterial population in the gut, many potential invaders are not able to compete and are thus kept at bay. This barrier is often referred to as the \"external immune barrier.\" The epidermis also contains specialized immune cells, such as Langerhans cells, which are responsible for recognizing and capturing antigens, aiding in the immune response. Moreover, both the mucous membranes and skin contain a variety of immune cells, including mast cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, that actively participate in the immune response against invading pathogens. Together, the mucous membranes and skin form an essential part of the body's immune system, acting as the first line of defense against external threats. They work together to prevent the entry of pathogens and support the overall immune response, ultimately helping to maintain our health and well-being.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube dividing several times to form a ball of cells called a morula. This stage is \n\n Prenatal development includes the development of the embryo and of the foetus during a viviparous animal's gestation. Prenatal development starts with fertilization, in the germinal stage of embryonic development, and continues in fetal development until birth. By the end of the tenth week of gestational age the embryo has acquired its basic form and is referred to as a fetus. The next period is that of fetal development where many organs become fully developed. This fetal period is described both topically (by organ) and chronologically (by time) with major occurrences being listed by gestational age. The very early stages of embryonic development are the same in all mammals. Later stages of development across all taxa of animals and the length of gestation vary. Failure to fuse between the palatine shelves and the nasal septum is most likely responsible for the patient's disorder. It is important to note that the fusion between the palatine shelves and the nasal septum is a complex process that involves multiple genetic and environmental factors. From the 10th week of gestation (8th week of development), the developing organism is called a fetus. All major structures are already formed in the fetus, but they continue to grow and develop. Since the precursors of all the major organs are created by this time, the fetal period is described both by organ and by a list of changes by weeks of gestational age. Because the precursors of the organs are now formed, the fetus is not as sensitive to damage from environmental exposure as the embryo was. The embryo becomes embedded in the endometrium in a process called implantation. Rapid growth occurs and the embryo's main features begin to take form. During this critical period (most of the first trimester), the developing embryo is also susceptible to toxic exposures, such as:\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

Stimulation of the rostral premotor area elicits more general movement patterns, predominantly of proximal limb musculature. The latter movements are effected via pathways other than those derived from area 4 (hence, “parapyramidal”). From this it may be assumed that the premotor cortex includes several anatomically distinct subregions with different afferent and efferent connections. In general, it may be said that the motor–premotor cortex is capable of synthesizing agonist actions into an almost infinite variety of finely graded, highly differentiated patterns. Stimulation of this area may induce relatively gross ipsilateral or contralateral movements, bilateral tonic contractions of the limbs, contraversive movements of the head and eyes with tonic contraction of the contralateral arm, and sometimes inhibition of voluntary motor activity and vocal arrest.The traditional view, based on the interpretations of Hughlings Jackson and of Sherrington, and elaborated by Denny-Brown, has been that the motor cortex is organized not in terms of individual muscles but of movements, that is, the coordinated contraction of groups of muscles. Rather, they reflect the coordinated activity of large groups of muscles.Normal movements (or postures), however, are rarely, if ever, caused by the isolated contraction of an individual muscle.Motor neurons to muscles of the distal part of the limb are located most laterally, whereas those that innervate more proximal muscles are located more medially (\n\nFig. In general, interneurons that supply the limb muscles are located mainly in the lateral parts of the deep dorsal horn and the intermediate region between the dorsal and ventral horns. All of these interneurons receive synaptic connections from primary afferent fibers and from the axons of pathways that descend from the brain, and thus they are part of both spinal reflex arcs and descending motor control pathways. An important aspect of interneuronal systems is that the laterally placed interneurons project ipsilaterally to motor neurons that supply the distal or the proximal limb muscles, whereas the medial interneurons project bilaterally. This arrangement of the lateral interneurons allows the limbs to be controlled independently. In contrast, the bilateral arrangement of the medial interneurons allows bilateral control of motor neurons to the axial muscles to provide postural support to the trunk and neck. Although motor neurons are the final common pathway from the CNS to muscles and thus shape how neuronal activity is transformed into muscular contraction, each motor neuron directly acts on only a single muscle. The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus and is often visualized as the motor homunculus. In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, \n\nThe cerebral cortex plays a direct role in regulating muscle activity in fine motor movements of the distal muscles of the limbs. In the case of fine motor movements involving the distal muscles of the limbs, such as the fingers and hands, the cerebral cortex influences muscle activity more directly. When the Golgi tendon organs in these muscles are stretched, type Ib afferent sensory nerves are activated. However, in the specific context of fine motor movements of the distal muscles of the limbs, the cerebral cortex directly influences muscle activity to achieve precise control and coordination.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

It has also been occasionally reported to involve the major salivary glands. Later, in the ulcerated stage, the overlying mucosa breaks down to leave a deep, well-circumscribed ulcer which is yellow-gray in color and has a lobular base. There may be prodromal symptoms similar to flu before the appearance of the lesion. CGCG is the most common giant cell lesion of the jaws. These lesions are localised fibrous tissue tumours which contain osteoclasts and are usually several centimetres across. Paresthesia of the lip has also been observed.

The articular disk of the temporomandibular joint is a thin, oval plate made of non-vascular fibrous connective tissue, which is located between the mandible's condyloid process and the cranium's mandibular fossa. Its upper surface is concavo-convex from before \n\nIn anatomy, the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) are the two joints connecting the jawbone to the skull. It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived. This joint is unique in that it is a bilateral joint that functions as one unit. Since the TMJ is connected to the mandible, the right and left joints must function together and therefore are not independent of each other. Structure \nThe main components are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle. Articular disc\n\nThe unique feature of the temporomandibular joint is the articular disc. The temporomandibular joints are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The central area of the disc is avascular and lacks innervation, thus getting its nutrients from the surrounding synovial fluid. In contrast, the posterior ligament and the surrounding capsules along have both blood vessels and nerves. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo the addition of cartilage in the central part, changes that may lead to impaired movement of the joint. The synovial membrane covers the inner surface of the articular capsule in the TMJ, except for the surface of the articular disc and condylar cartilage. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone. Ligaments\nThere are three ligaments associated with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function. The base of this triangular ligament is attached to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. Other ligaments, called \"oto-mandibular ligaments\", connect the middle ear (malleus) with the temporomandibular joint:\n discomallear (or disco-malleolar) ligament,\n malleomandibular (or malleolar-mandibular) ligament. Nerve supply\nSensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is derived from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. The specific mechanics of proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors. Pacinian corpuscles are dynamic mechanoreceptors that accelerate movement during reflexes. Golgi tendon organs function as static mechanoreceptors for the protection of ligaments around the temporomandibular joint. The fibrocartilage that overlays the TMJ condyle is not innervated and is avascular in healthy TMJs. When bone tissue, ligaments, or muscles become inflamed or injured, sensory signals are relayed along small-diameter primary afferent nerve fibers that form the trigeminal nerve. Signals are directed through the trigeminal nerve and modulated by neuronal cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint. Development\nFormation of the temporomandibular joints occurs at around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the component of the fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Very little is known about the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. Function \n\nEach temporomandibular joint is classed as a \"ginglymoarthrodial\" joint since it is both a ginglymus (hinging joint) and an arthrodial (sliding) joint. At this point, if the mouth continues to open, not only are the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) translates. This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies in the vicinity of the mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible. The resting position of the temporomandibular joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and proprioceptive feedback allow a physiologic rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance, or freeway space, which is 2 to 4 mm between the teeth. For example, if the measurement from the edge of the lower front teeth to the edge of the upper front teeth is 40 millimeters and the overbite is 3 millimeters, then the jaw opening is 43 millimeters. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles. When the mandible is moved into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle on the side of the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side condyle performs the translation. The mandible is moved primarily by the four muscles of mastication: the masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid and the temporalis. Clinical significance\n\nPain\n\nTemporomandibular joint pain is generally due to one of four reasons. Temporal arteritis, for which it is considered a reliable diagnostic criteria\n\nPain or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is sometimes referred to as temporomandibular joint dysfunction or temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). This term is used to refer to a group of problems involving the temporomandibular joints and the muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and other tissues associated with them. These conditions include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor, and aneurysmal bone cyst. Examination\nThe temporomandibular joints can be felt in front of or within the external acoustic meatus during movements of the mandible. Disc displacement\nThe most common disorder of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement. In essence, this is when the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the condyle and the fossa so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on something other than the articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because, unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation. In most instances of disorder, the disc is displaced anteriorly upon translation, or the anterior and inferior sliding motion of the condyle forward within the fossa and down the articular eminence. On opening, a \"pop\" or \"click\" can sometimes be heard and usually felt also, indicating the condyle is moving back onto the disk, known as \"reducing the joint\" (disc displacement with reduction). Upon closing, the condyle will slide off the back of the disc, hence another \"click\" or \"pop\" at which point the condyle is posterior to the disc. In disc displacement without reduction the disc stays anterior to the condylar head upon opening.
