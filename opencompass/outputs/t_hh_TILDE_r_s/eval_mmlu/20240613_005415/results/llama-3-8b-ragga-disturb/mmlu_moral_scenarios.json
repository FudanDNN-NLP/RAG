Hepburn: \"To move towards the objectivist pole is to argue that moral judgements can be rationally defensible, true or false, that there are rational procedural tests for identifying morally impermissible actions, or that moral values exist independently of the feeling-states of individuals at particular times.\" Linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky states: \"'if we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.'\" While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. However, W.D. In his analysis, even if the prosecution could prove all of the \n\n Consequentialists, in particular, reject the notion that two acts can differ in their moral permissibility if both have exactly the same consequences, or expected consequences. John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century advocate of the utilitarian version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: \"He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations.\" Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and unintended consequences. Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions.

Non-maleficence focuses on avoiding harm to patients, and justice encompasses the fair distribution of healthcare resources and equal treatment for all. According to the African ethic of social cohesion, which emphasizes communal relationships and entering into community with others, the concept of social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic can be viewed in different ways. While some may argue that social distancing could be seen as a violation of this ethic, others argue that it is not inherently wrong and can even be seen as the right way to commune under certain circumstances. In this perspective, social distancing would not be considered wrong if it is necessary to protect others from serious incapacitation or harm. However, it is important to note that there may be cases in which social distancing, while morally permissible and necessary, may still indicate a lack of good character. This suggests that although social distancing aligns with the principles of communal relationship and protection, it may not be seen as a virtuous act in certain situations. For instance, whether a particular killing was done in self-defense or in order to facilitate a robbery is probably relevant to whether it is wrong.

Hemenway argues as well that the correct interpretation of the Second Amendment is that \"rights should be determined and disputes resolved not through private judgment of each individual backed by private force \n\nCHICAGO -- Rambunctious third-graders filled a classroom in Seattle on a crisp autumn day. One of the students dropped his backpack, and horror ensued. That student had brought a parent's gun to school and was carrying it in his backpack. When the bag fell to the floor, the impact caused the gun to fire, sending a bullet straight into another student's abdomen, said Dr. Thomas Weiser, a trauma surgeon at Stanford University Medical Center. When the student arrived at the hospital, awake and alert with a bullet hole oozing blood just below her heart, she had a jarring expression of confusion in her brown eyes, Weiser said. Doctors also emphasize that there are methods available to safely secure and store firearms, away from children, and they recommend that parents employ those methods when keeping guns in the home. As for unintentional firearm injuries, Weiser said, the third-grade girl he treated was not the only accidental gunshot wound he saw in a child. Another such injury involved a boy around 9 who was given a handgun for his birthday. For suicides, which were calculated only for children 10 and older in the study, the researchers found that incidents were widely dispersed across the country. \"Just having access to a gun in a situation where you're upset with what's going on at school or with your friends, or your own internal emotional state, it unfortunately can lead to suicide. It's very important for parents to be aware of that, particularly if they have guns in the home.\" \"Although firearm homicides of children significantly increased between 2002 and 2007, they significantly declined between 2007 and 2014,\" Fowler said. \"This is a very encouraging trend. \"Preventing such injuries and ensuring that all children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments remains one of our most important priorities.\" Fowler pointed to a collection of strategies that the CDC has developed to help states and communities build effective programs, policies and practices around violence prevention. Dr. Stephen Hargarten, professor and chairman of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin, likened gun violence in America to a disease. \"The psychosocial components are related to the circumstances of these events, of the domestic violence disputes that result in children getting injured or killed, the psychological issues surrounding the transitions of thinking or feeling suicidal and ending their life,\" Hargarten said. \"Then the social aspects of this are related to the environmental circumstances,\" he said. \"And the social constructs of companies that make these products that are available to children, that can be used very easily by children, and so it really is a complex disease.\" \"That would have an impact in the home -- where, again, properly secure it -- but even if the child or young adult does find the gun, they can't use it because they're not authorized to access the gun,\" Hargarten said. Being mindful of who is nearby when a gun is being handled in the home can also play a role in injury prevention, said Wesson, the pediatric surgeon in Texas. \"The father was sitting there, on a kitchen chair, and was doing something with his rifle. \"Everything was healed up in the end, but it was a devastating and tragic event, and of course you can imagine how the parents felt about it. \"Health care centers and trauma centers and people participating in trauma care can offer a lot to injured people, but the rational approach is to prevent these injuries from occurring in the first place, whether it's unintentional or intentional.\" Rather, \"we can point out that parents may underestimate kids' propensity to handle guns unsafely, even when they've been taught,\" Nelson wrote. \"And finally, given the impulsivity, risk-taking, and unpredictability of adolescence, we should promote safe storage as a routine measure.\" He compared gun violence to an earthquake. \"And so, why we can't make safer guns and make safer laws is beyond me.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

University of Manchester philosopher Eve Garrard suggests that evil does not describe ordinary wrongdoing, and that \"there is a qualitative and not merely a quantitative difference between evil acts and other wrongful ones; evil acts are not just very bad or wrongful acts, but rather ones possessing some specially horrific quality\". John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century advocate of the utilitarian version of consequentialism, argues that it is a mistake to confuse the standards for right action with a consideration of our motives to perform a right action: \"He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble; he who betrays the friend that trusts him, is guilty of a crime, even if his object be to serve another friend to whom he is under greater obligations.\" Therefore, Mill argues, our moral analysis should ignore matters of motivation, and so we should reject DDE, which appeals to a distinction between intended and unintended consequences. Mill further claims that scrutiny of motives will reveal a man's character, but utilitarianism does not judge character, only the rightness or wrongness of actions. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. However, W.D.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

In the case of medical procedures, such as in the example of an ectopic pregnancy, where the embryo becomes lodged in the fallopian tube and poses a threat to the life of the woman, the Church may find it morally permissible to remove the affected section of the fallopian tube, which ultimately leads to the death of the embryo. According to the principle of double effect, there are certain conditions that must be met for the action to be considered morally permissible. Deontologists believe that ethical rules bind individuals to their duty or obligation. Consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, evaluate the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its outcomes and aim to maximize overall happiness or utility. Teleological theories also consider the end goal or purpose of an action in assessing its morality. While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. However, W.D.

There are several potential benefits to using artificial intelligence for depression, as we'll outline below. Those who develop artificial intelligence based programs work diligently, using extraordinary amounts of data, to create a similar space that allows people to feel connected and understood. In addition to the felt sense of emotional connection, artificial intelligence connects people with needed services who may otherwise not be able to access help. The ability to access and use mental health resources that are designed using artificial intelligence can be a lifeline of hope for people in areas where there is little to no help available. The use of mobile apps and artificial intelligence platforms allows for people to receive mental health services in the safety of their personal living space. Being able to maintain our privacy while talking about difficult things in the comfort of our personal space, and doing all of this at our convenience, can be very appealing. Many of the obstacles that might prevent people from seeking and receiving help for depression are removed, or at least minimized, by artificial intelligence based programs available. However, it is critically important to note that these technology based resources using artificial intelligence are not intended to replace clinical treatment of depression or any other mental health issue. Below are some examples artificial intelligence based technology that can be used to help fight depression. It is designed to offer convenient care to those struggling with depression by mimicking human conversation, offering self-help related guidance and companionship to its users. The program can share with you information and resources, such as videos and exercises, based on what it thinks you are needing at that time. WoeBot can be used anonymously on iPhones and iPads and you can also chat with it through Facebook Messenger. The basis of WoeBot is designed with influence from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a therapeutic framework that works to help people change their unhelpful thinking and behaviors, ideally leading to improved mood and decision making. As you continue to chat with WoeBot, it collects data through natural language processing (NLP) and uses this information to get to know you better. Wysa is described on the company site as an artificial intelligence-based, \"emotionally intelligent\" bot that is able to \"help you manage your emotions and thoughts.\" Just like WoeBot, Wysa is designed with influences from CBT to help you challenge and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. As with other AI-based programs, Wysa continues to collect data as you chat in order to more accurately read and meet your behavioral and mental health needs. You can use Wysa anonymously, similar to WoeBot. Another artificial intelligence platform used for mental health care, Tess is described as \"a psychological AI that administers highly personalized psycho-education and health-related reminders on demand.\" The collection of data through consistent messaging allows Tess to determine appropriate responses and offer helpful information and guidance that is relevant to your struggles. It is described as using artificial intelligence to be able to adapt to the user's personal needs and goals. X2AI, the company that developed Tess, states that this program is not intended to replace clinical therapy, but designed to be used as additional support in the treatment process. Researchers and programmers in the field of artificial intelligence are working diligently to bring those same qualities to technology-based mental health care. Tess, WoeBot, Wysa, and other similar programs are offering accessibility by being available for use 24/7 at little to no cost to the user. Many people value their privacy and, at times, enjoy the anonymity that technology can provide. When considering the sensitive and personal nature of the content often shared in counseling and therapy, it is understandable that programs using artificial intelligence in this way can be a significant benefit in the field of mental health care. Remote areas lacking providers, stigma associated with seeking help or fear of reaching out when we are hurting are all barriers working to be removed as the field of artificial intelligence continues to develop these personalized resources. Remember, although the resources using artificial intelligence can be helpful, they are not intended to take the place of professional clinical mental health treatment.

One example is the use of smartphone apps to reduce depressive symptoms. Another example is web-based mindfulness interventions, which aim to improve mental well-being through practices like meditation and stress reduction techniques.

For example, a study focused on healthcare workers developed a digital learning program to mitigate the psychological impact of COVID-19.

One such view is utilitarianism, which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce. In the standard form defended by Immanuel Kant, deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality. It also includes investigating whether or not there is a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about it. The main branches of ethics are normative ethics, meta-ethics and applied ethics.

This rule, which originated from a famous legal case in the early 19th century, provides criteria to determine whether an individual can be held criminally responsible for their actions based on their mental state at the time of the offense. It takes into account whether a person, at the time of the offense, was unable to comprehend the nature of their actions or unable to recognize that their actions were morally wrong. This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception. In cases where the criminal responsibility exception for the insane is successfully applied, individuals may be acquitted of criminal charges and instead be subjected to psychiatric treatment or commitment to a mental health facility.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else. For instance, whether a particular killing was done in self-defense or in order to facilitate a robbery is probably relevant to whether it is wrong.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

It establishes a lower bound for when such interventions would be considered ethically acceptable. Similarly, the perfectionist approach, which focuses on enhancing certain traits and qualities, may prioritize specific traits deemed desirable by society. This approach risks undermining the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals and can lead to discrimination and exclusion of those who do not meet the set standards of perfection.

The policy guideline comes at a time of heightened awareness of the long-term brain effects of child abuse and neglect in all its forms. “Child abuse and neglect, also referred to as child maltreatment—words or actions that cause or fail to protect children from harm, potential harm, or the threat of harm—is associated with negative physical and emotional health outcomes that persist and can lead to serious disorders throughout the life course,” the Task Force said in its statement. Instead of corporal or harsh verbal punishment, the AAP policy emphasizes “positive parenting,” which includes modeling the type of behavior that is expected, preparing for situations that might elicit unruly behavior, and reinforcing good behavior in children. When a rule is broken and the need for stronger discipline arises, the AAP suggests age-appropriate interventions such as redirecting the child’s attention elsewhere (for infants/toddlers) or a time-out period equal to one minute per year of age. Some examples include:\n\n1. Failure to promote appropriate socialization: This can involve isolating the child, not providing opportunities for social interactions or education, involving children in unlawful activities, or not providing adequate stimulation and support for their development. It is important to note that these signs should be observed consistently over time to raise suspicion of emotional abuse or neglect. Overall, it is crucial to carefully observe and assess a child's behavior towards their parent or carer, considering these signs as potential indicators of neglect or physical abuse. age, Papa admits the silent treatment is becoming outmoded, and now resorts to extra chores or revocation of allowances as punishments. ; In loco parentis. School is often shown as having little tolerance for child hijinks. ; In The Great Brain, a teacher is shown who paddles boys who break school rules. Girls who break school rules are slapped on the palm with a ruler and made to stay after school to clean it. When Tom gets paddled for refusing to tattle on a friend, this sets events in \n\nPrompting/helping: Mother physically or vocally prompts and scaffolds child (e.g., physical prompting with toy if child becomes frustrated) ; Following the child's lead: Mother is sensitive to child's interests and follows the child to his/her desired toy/activity (e.g., Mom may appear to wait for child to choose a toy and then insert herself into interaction) ; Redirection of attention: Mother distracts the child or directs the child's attention away from negative stimulus (e.g., pointing out other toys in room) ; Active ignoring: Mother actively ignores child during distress episodes (e.g., mom may continue to play with a toy or purposely turn away from child) ; Reassurance: Mother reassures or encourages child surrounding frustrating or negative activity (e.g., It's okay. ; Emotional following: Mother's reflection, extension or elaboration upon child's distress or preoccupation (e.g., I know you want the toy) ; Physical comfort: Mother initiates behaviors to comfort child (e.g., hugging, kissing, picking up the child, rocking) ; Vocal comfort: Mother initiates vocalizations to comfort the child (e.g., sshhing, singing, sing-song voice) Examples of co-regulating parent behaviors/caregiver-guided dyadic regulation:\n\nUsing scolding, physical punishment, and threats as disciplinary techniques for children can have potentially harmful effects on their well-being. It is important for parents to express displeasure about specific events without resorting to derogatory statements about the child. Similarly, frequent mild physical punishment, or corporal punishment, can become less effective over time and may increase the risk of child abuse. It teaches children that it is acceptable to use physical force in certain situations, leading to aggressive behavior towards others, including their siblings. Moreover, threats by parents to leave or give up the child can be extremely psychologically damaging. Discipline should focus on teaching children what is expected of them, reinforcing positive behaviors, and setting proper limits for negative behaviors. Parents should understand that their child is inherently good, even if they engage in occasional misbehavior. Overall, it is crucial for parents to adopt positive discipline techniques that promote healthy emotional development, self-esteem, and a sense of security in children. This can include techniques such as positive reinforcement, setting clear boundaries, and using logical consequences rather than resorting to scolding, physical punishment, or threats. Reference:\nThreatening a mild loss of privileges (no video games for 1 week or grounding a teenager) may be appropriate, but the consequence must be enforced if there is a violation.Children of any age may remain fearful and anxious about loss of the parent long after the threat is made; however many children are able to see through empty threats.Parents who set too few reasonable limits may be frustrated by children who cannot control their own behavior. Commonly used techniques to control undesirable behaviors in children include scolding, physical punishment, and threats. These techniques have potential adverse effects on children’s sense of security and self-esteem. It is important to educate parents that they have a good child who does bad things from time to time, so parents do not think and tell the child that he or she is “bad.”\\n\\nFrequent mild physical punishment (corporal punishment) may become less effective over time and tempt the parent to escalate the physical punishment, increasing the risk of child abuse.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

In this scenario, a pregnant woman seeks medical counseling regarding potential risks associated with her pregnancy. However, the advisor mistakenly provides incorrect information, leading the woman to decide to undergo an abortion. Later, it is discovered that the information given by the advisor was wrong. The second type involves misinformation about the health of the fetus. Here, the woman seeks advice concerning the health and well-being of her fetus, and decides to have an abortion after being informed that the fetus is deformed or disabled. These cases represent a mirror image of wrongful abortion cases, although they are not exact reflections. These cases involve negligence or misinformation by healthcare providers, leading to unwanted outcomes related to pregnancy and childbirth. the reward for stealing is a substantial sum, their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought. Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else. In some ways, it is — but not where it matters, argued a handful of surgeons in a new paper on Monday. The study authors worry that the acclaimed drama could be giving patients inaccurate expectations for their own outcomes and their family members’ outcomes in an emergency medicine scenario. Also in the current season, one of the main characters, Dr. Miranda Bailey, an African-American woman, suffers a heart attack but is told by multiple white male doctors that her symptoms are stress-related. In 2008, during Season 4, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a study in partnership with the show’s writers that demonstrated how the drama could effectively persuade misinformed viewers. By working with the showrunners to write a character arc that addresses how likely it is for an HIV-positive mother to transmit the disease to an unborn child — not that likely, with proper treatment — and surveying viewers before and after watching the episode, researchers found that the show has the very real potential to clear up misconceptions about health topics. It is impossible for one such killing to be wrong and another right unless they also differ in one or more relevant circumstances. Of course, there could be additional relevant circumstances; if Charles had previously enslaved Brenda for several years, and she finds an opportunity to escape to freedom but needs his car to do so, and knows that he will pursue and \n\n be obeyed and also that his theory of ethical wrongness would break down. He proposed that divine command morality assumes that human concepts of right and wrong are met by God's commands and that the theory can only be applied if this is the case. Adams' theory attempts to counter the challenge that morality might be arbitrary, as moral commands are not based solely on the commands of God, but are founded on his omnibenevolence. It attempts to challenge the claim that an external standard of morality prevents God from being sovereign by making him the source of morality and his character the moral law.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about moral scenarios.

However, when the same scenario is presented to people, but instead of flicking a switch, subjects are asked whether they would push a fat man onto the rails in order to stop the trolley, intuitions usually have it that pushing the fat man is the wrong choice. Given that both actions lead to the saving of five people, why is one judged to be right, whereas the other one wrong? According to Greene, there is no moral justification for this difference of intuitions between the 'switch' and the 'fat man' trolley-case.

This exception is based on the understanding that individuals suffering from severe mental illnesses or disorders may not have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and consequences of their actions or to differentiate between right and wrong. The specific criteria for determining the criminal responsibility exception for the insane may vary based on legal jurisdictions, but there are generally two main standards used. The first is the M'Naghten rule, which focuses on whether the person knew the nature of their actions and could understand that what they were doing was morally wrong. The second is the irresistible impulse test, which considers whether the individual had the ability to control their behavior and prevent themselves from committing the crime due to their mental condition. Courts may rely on psychiatric evaluations and expert testimonies to determine whether someone meets the criteria for the exception.
