Its GDP per capita was estimated at roughly $57,101 in the fiscal year 2019/20, which makes it one of highest-earning nations in the world (see list of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). Between 1996 and 2000, annual economic growth (GDP) averaged over 4%, well above the European average of 2.5% at the time. Growth slowed considerably in 2001–05 as part of the early 2000s recession.

There, however, was a slight increase in acceptance since 2007, when a Pew Research poll showed that 8% of the population believe homosexuality should be accepted. The Pew Research Center's 2013 Global Attitudes Survey found that there is “greater acceptance in more secular and affluent countries,” with \"publics in 39 countries [having] broad acceptance of homosexuality in North America, the European Union, and much of Latin America, but equally widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and in Russia.

Similarly to the broader American public, U.S. Muslims have become more accepting of homosexuality in recent years. In a 2007 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, 27% of American Muslims believed that homosexuality should be accepted. In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society outnumber those who say it should be discouraged (52% of respondents, versus 33%), a level of acceptance similar to U.S. Protestants (52% in 2016).

This was lower than the percent energy production from solar power of the European Union (4.9%) but greater than the percent share in the United States (2.8%).

December 2014 was the best month, generating 8.9 TWh and on par with record-breaking month of December 2011. Domestic solar projects have also been heavily subsidized by the Chinese government, allowing for China's solar energy capacity to dramatically soar. As a result, they have become the leading country for solar energy, passing Germany's capacity in 2015. China's mass production of cheap photovoltaic cells and wind energy have consequently spurred investments in Chinese products from around the world and expanded the construction of solar energy projects worldwide. In 2018, China saw a decrease in annual solar energy, dropping down to 44.4 GW. In 2019, annual solar energy installation further dropped to 30.1 GW, even lower than the installations made in 2016. This decline in growth is attributed to the Chinese government restructuring government incentives to start solar energy projects in May 2018.

The share of gross domestic products was same as the average of OECD states in 2008. According to 2018 data, share of gross domestic products rose to 10.9% of GDP, overtaking the OECD average of 8.8%. The government has controlled cost over decades using the national uniform fee schedule for reimbursement. In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita in Asia. It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2025. Japan also has comparatively low social spending: among the OECD countries in 1995, Japan spent only 14.0% of its GDP on social expenditures, lower than many other OECD countries: this figure compares to 15.4% in the US, 20.4% in the UK, 19.8% in Italy, 26.6% in Germany, 28.3% in France, and 32.5% in Sweden. The model argued that the central economic policies conducted by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party from 1955 through 1993 caused Japan's economic growth in the post-war era. The World Bank's World Development Indicators 2005 estimated that in 2003, one Geary–Khamis dollar was equivalent to about 1.8 Chinese yuan by purchasing power parity —considerably different from the nominal exchange rate. This discrepancy has large implications; for instance, when converted via the nominal exchange rates GDP per capita in India is about US$1,965 while on a PPP basis it is about US$7,197.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about global facts.

Child mortality is not only caused by infection and disorder: it is also caused by premature birth; birth defect; new born infection; birth complication; and diseases like malaria, sepsis, and diarrhea. In less developed countries, malnutrition is the main cause of child mortality. Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 deaths before the age of 5 while nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under-nutrition. Child survival is a field of public health concerned with reducing child mortality. Child survival interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur, which include diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and neonatal conditions. Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone, an estimated 5.6 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes. The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which focused on reducing child mortality by 2/3 of children under five before the year 2015. Without accelerated progress, 60 million children under age 5 will die between 2017 and 2030, about half of which would be newborns. Global Burden of Disease Study shows that diarrhoeal diseases account for 5.91% of total deaths among all age groups of Nepal in 2017. In the same year, the data indicates that diarrhoeal diseases has the highest cause of death of 9.14% in the age group 5–14 years followed by 8.91% deaths in 70+ age group. A survey done in Kathmandu showed the presence of Giardia \n\n per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 39 in 2015 and the neonatal mortality rate decreased from 32 deaths per 1,000 live births to 21 in 2015 (Figure 2).

Water delivered in Peru tends to be unsanitary and non-potable. However, wealthier citizens are more easily able to treat water in their homes, while poorer citizens often lack the resources to properly treat their water. One obstacle I often see as a medical microbiologist working in developing countries, is a lack of access to clean water, which makes preventing and controlling infections nearly impossible. Before we got to the door of the emergency department, we could smell the problem: gangrene. While water scarcity in California and Cape Town makes headlines, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF report that 2.1 billion people lack access to a safe and sustainable water supply. Around 40 per cent of health care facilities in developing countries do not have a water supply. This is why the water crisis is a health crisis. Having access to safe water and sanitation is central to improving health and fighting diseases that are increasingly resistant to treatments, such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery. Despite the resolution, water scarcity has spread rapidly to many parts of the world as population and consumption levels have increased against a fixed supply of renewable fresh water. These shortages lead to sanitation and hygiene problems and, as a result, foster a high number of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, gastroenteritis and cholera. Having access to safe water and sanitation is central to improving health and fighting diseases that are increasingly resistant to treatments, such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery. In 2015, 67% of the total population had access to \"at least basic water supply\". In 2015, around 60 million people lacked access to \"at least basic\" water.

About 60% of these (forced) stoppages on roads by concerned authorities such as government regulators, police, forest, sales and excise, octroi, and weighing and measuring departments \n\n People in 107 countries have been surveyed whether they have paid a bribe to a public body during the last year; but for a small number of these countries, Albania, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Burundi, Fiji, France, Germany, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malawi, Russia and Zambia, response data on particular questions has been excluded because of concerns about validity and reliability. In a 2013 article in Foreign Policy, Alex Cobham argued that the CPI embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption, potentially contributing to a vicious cycle and at the same time incentivizing inappropriate policy responses. The study found India's defence, the information technology industry and energy sectors to be the most competitive and least corruption prone sectors. These include the rural and urban poor, although the study claims that nationwide perception of corruption has decreased between 2005 and 2010.
