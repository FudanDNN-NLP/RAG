Most of these viruses are very common and typically asymptomatic in most human populations studied. BK virus is associated with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus with Merkel cell cancer. Structure and genome\n\nPolyomaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with circular genomes of around 5000 base pairs. The capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres of a protein called VP1, which is capable of self-assembly into a closed icosahedron; each pentamer of VP1 is associated with one molecule of one of the other two capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3. The genome of a typical polyomavirus codes for between 5 and 9 proteins, divided into two transcriptional regions called the early and late regions due to the time during infection in which they are transcribed. Each region is transcribed by the host cell's RNA polymerase II as a single pre-messenger RNA containing multiple genes. Additional genes and other variations on this theme are present in some viruses: for example, rodent polyomaviruses have a third protein called middle tumor antigen in the early region, which is extremely efficient at inducing cellular transformation; SV40 has an additional capsid protein VP4; some examples have an additional regulatory protein called agnoprotein expressed from the late region. Cellular receptors for polyomaviruses are sialic acid residues of glycans, commonly gangliosides. The attachment of polyomaviruses to host cells is mediated by the binding of VP1 to sialylated glycans on the cell surface. In some particular viruses, additional cell-surface interactions occur; for example, the JC virus is believed to require interaction with the 5HT2A receptor and the Merkel cell virus with heparan sulfate. However, in general virus-cell interactions are mediated by commonly occurring molecules on the cell surface, and therefore are likely not a major contributor to individual viruses' observed cell-type tropism. The details of transit to the nucleus are not clear and may vary among individual polyomaviruses. It has been frequently reported that an intact, albeit distorted, virion particle is released from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell cytoplasm, where the genome is released from the capsid, possibly due to the low calcium concentration in the cytoplasm. Both expression of viral genes and replication of the viral genome occur in the nucleus using host cell machinery. The precise mechanism of this dysregulation depends on the virus; for example, SV40 LT can directly bind host cell p53, but murine polyomavirus LT does not. As these interactions begin, the LTs belonging to several polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, present oncogenic potential. Taxonomy\nThe polyomaviruses are members of group I (dsDNA viruses). The classification of polyomaviruses has been the subject of several proposed revisions as new members of the group are discovered. Formerly, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, which share many structural features but have very different genomic organizations, were classified together in the now-obsolete family Papovaviridae. (The name Papovaviridae derived from three abbreviations: Pa for Papillomavirus, Po for Polyomavirus, and Va for \"vacuolating.\") The polyomaviruses were divided into three major clades (that is, genetically-related groups): the SV40 clade, the avian clade, and the murine polyomavirus clade. A subsequent proposed reclassification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recommended dividing the family of Polyomaviridae into three genera:\n Genus Orthopolyomavirus (type species SV40)\n Genus Wukipolyomavirus (type species KI polyomavirus)\n Genus Avipolyomavirus (type species Avian polyomavirus)\n\nThe current ICTV classification system recognises six genera and 117 species, of which five could not be assigned a genus. This system retains the distinction between avian and mammalian viruses, grouping the avian subset into the genus Gammapolyomavirus. The six genera are:\n Alphapolyomavirus\n Betapolyomavirus\n Deltapolyomavirus\n Epsilonpolyomavirus\n Gammapolyomavirus\n Zetapolyomavirus\n\nThe following species are unassigned to a genus:\n Centropristis striata polyomavirus 1\n Rhynchobatus djiddensis polyomavirus 1\n Sparus aurata polyomavirus 1\n Trematomus bernacchii polyomavirus 1\n Trematomus pennellii polyomavirus 1\n\nDescription of additional viruses is ongoing. Human polyomaviruses \nMost polyomaviruses do not infect humans. Of the polyomaviruses cataloged as of 2017, a total of 14 were known with human hosts. However, some polyomaviruses are associated with human disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Lyon IARC polyomavirus is related to raccoon polyomavirus. List of human polyomaviruses\nThe following 14 polyomaviruses with human hosts had been identified and had their genomes sequenced as of 2017:\n\nDeltapolyomavirus contains only the four human viruses shown in the above table. The Alpha and Beta groups contain viruses that infect a variety of mammals. Antibodies to the monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus have been detected in humans suggesting that this virus - or a closely related virus - can infect humans. Clinical relevance\nAll the polyomaviruses are highly common childhood and young adult infections. Diseases caused by human polyomavirus infections are most common among immunocompromised people; disease associations include BK virus with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus (MCV) with Merkel cell cancer. Competition assays are frequently needed to distinguish among highly similar polyomaviruses. There are three main diagnostic techniques used for the diagnosis of the reactivation of polyomavirus in polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN): urine cytology, quantification of the viral load in both urine and blood, and a renal biopsy. History \nMurine polyomavirus was the first polyomavirus discovered, having been reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 as an extract of mouse leukemias capable of inducing parotid gland tumors. The causative agent was identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy, after whom it was once called \"SE polyoma\". The term \"polyoma\" refers to the viruses' ability to produce multiple (poly-) tumors (-oma) under certain conditions. The name has been criticized as a \"meatless linguistic sandwich\" (\"meatless\" because both morphemes in \"polyoma\" are affixes) giving little insight into the viruses' biology; in fact, subsequent research has found that most polyomaviruses rarely cause clinically significant disease in their host organisms under natural conditions. Dozens of polyomaviruses have been identified and sequenced as of 2017, infecting mainly birds and mammals. A total of fourteen polyomaviruses are known to infect humans.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was a law passed by the United States Congress in 1992 which allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect fees from drug manufacturers to fund the new drug approval process. The Act provided that the FDA was entitled to collect a substantial application fee from drug manufacturers at the time a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted, with those funds designated for use only in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) drug approval activities. All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. Pharmaceutical companies had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. The FDA estimated that a delay of one month in a review’s completion cost its sponsor $10 million. The FDA argued that it needed additional staff to end its back-log of drugs awaiting approval for market. AIDS epidemic\n\nThe length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. PDUFA gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a revenue source, fees paid by pharmaceutical companies seeking the approval of new drugs, to supplement but not replace direct appropriations from Congress. These include application review fees paid by the sponsor for each drug or biologic application submitted, establishment fees paid by manufacturers annually for each of its facilities, and product fees paid annually for each product  on the market covered by PDUFA. The law provided exemptions and waivers for applications from small businesses, drugs aimed at orphan diseases, or unmet public health needs. In order to avoid listing specific performance goals in statutory language Congress stated in the bill’s “Findings” that, \"3) the fees authorized by this title will be dedicated toward expediting the review of human drug applications as set forth in the goals identified in the letters of September 14, 1992, and September 21, 1992, from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate, as set forth at 138 Cong. PDUFA II\n\nIn its 1997 reauthorization of PDUFA, Congress enacted stricter performance goals,  required increased transparency in the drug review process, and  tried to facilitate better communication between drug makers and patient advocacy groups. Congress expanded the scope of the legislation to include the investigational phases of a new drug’s development. When Congress was debating the legislation that implemented PDUFA II Rep. Billy Tauzin, who later became head of PhRMA and one of those leading the call for a  further streamlined review process, told a story of how a family friend had to travel to Mexico to obtain drugs that helped him overcome prostate cancer. In testimony before Congress, James Swire, an AIDS activist and health educator who became infected with HIV in 1990, said the FDA has dramatically reduced the time needed to approve life-saving drugs using the money from PDUFA. Swire said, \"I'm here because people really pushed the review process for AIDS and HIV treatments. There still is not a cure, but because of some of the new drugs, a lot of us have been able to get back to work.\" PDUFA III\n\nPDUFA III, part of the Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act, made appropriations for increased postmarket monitoring of new products and allowed the FDA to hire additional personnel to  speed the reviews of new drugs.

The PDUFA goal for the 1995 group called for a 70% on-time record. From 1993 through 1996, the years PDUFA I was in effect, the approval time for new drugs declined significantly while the number of new products increased. During this period, the approval time for new drugs never exceeded 30 months. The number of approvals ranged from 20 in 1988 to 30 in 1991. During the four years that PDUFA I was in effect, an average of 32 drugs were approved each year, ranging from 22 in 1994 to 53 in 1996. The increase in first drug launches in the United States from 1993 through 2003 is particularly interesting given that the European Union harmonized its regulatory regime for new drugs with those of other major markets in order to reduce barriers for drug approvals during the same period.

The Act provided that the FDA was entitled to collect a substantial application fee from drug manufacturers at the time a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted, with those funds designated for use only in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) drug approval activities.

AIDS epidemic\n\nThe length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. PDUFA gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a revenue source, fees paid by pharmaceutical companies seeking the approval of new drugs, to supplement but not replace direct appropriations from Congress. These include application review fees paid by the sponsor for each drug or biologic application submitted, establishment fees paid by manufacturers annually for each of its facilities, and product fees paid annually for each product  on the market covered by PDUFA. The law provided exemptions and waivers for applications from small businesses, drugs aimed at orphan diseases, or unmet public health needs. In order to avoid listing specific performance goals in statutory language Congress stated in the bill’s “Findings” that, \"3) the fees authorized by this title will be dedicated toward expediting the review of human drug applications as set forth in the goals identified in the letters of September 14, 1992, and September 21, 1992, from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate, as set forth at 138 Cong.

The first and largest of these was the People With AIDS Health Group (PWA Health Group), founded in 1986 by Thomas Hannan, Joseph Sonnabend, and Michael Callen. AIDS buyers clubs distributed such unapproved drugs as ribavirin, dextran sulfate, and DCNB (dinitrochlorobenzene), as well as cheaper pirated versions of zidovudine (AZT), which was the first drug that was FDA-approved for the treatment of AIDS. AIDS buyers clubs also distributed information about the disease and drug developments, and became an important source of AIDS treatment education and advocacy.

Child mortality is not only caused by infection and disorder: it is also caused by premature birth; birth defect; new born infection; birth complication; and diseases like malaria, sepsis, and diarrhea. In less developed countries, malnutrition is the main cause of child mortality. Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 deaths before the age of 5 while nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under-nutrition. Lower respiratory infections world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg for lower respiratory infections per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004 ]] Pneumonia is a common illness affecting approximately 450 million people a year and occurring in all parts of the world. It is a major cause of death among all age groups resulting in 4 million deaths (7% of the world's total death) yearly. It occurs about five times more frequently in the developing world than in the developed world. Some of the deadliest diseases in the world that can be minimized or prevented through education, public health practices, prevention, and adequate treatment include:\n\n1. Malaria: Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite transmitted through mosquito bites. It leads to major health problems and claims at least a million lives every year. TB claimed approximately 1.4 million lives in 2011. Prevention involves vaccinating infants at high risk and ensuring appropriate treatment to control and prevent the spread of the disease. Lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of death worldwide, particularly in children and the elderly. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is primarily caused by smoking and exposure to pollutants. It contributes to millions of deaths annually. While each of these diseases requires a multifaceted approach, education, public health practices, prevention, and appropriate treatment play crucial roles in minimizing their impact and preventing unnecessary deaths. In 2010, it resulted in 1.3 million deaths, or 18% of all deaths in those under five years, of which 95% occurred in the developing world. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43 million), China (21 million) and Pakistan (10 million). It is the leading cause of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. The shift in the burden of disease has led to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) becoming the leading cause of death globally, most of these deaths are due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, or diabetes. Mortality from many NCDs is on the rise worldwide, with a disproportionately larger burden in low-middle income countries (LMICs), where almost 3/4 of deaths globally occur from these causes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse \n\nThat time of the month again? The common cold is easily transferable because it is an upper respiratory infection caused by rhinovirus, or other viruses. It is more commonly caused by rhinovirus, because there are more than 100 different types of rhinoviruses which all have a human reservoir; meaning they only house their infections within a human host. The pathogenesis (the ability to cause disease) of a rhinovirus occurs after the incubation period which is usually 1-2 days after encountering the virus. The rhinovirus attaches to your respiratory epithelial cells and infects the cells by entering and producing multiple copies of itself. The epithelial cells eventually lyse (burst) releasing large numbers of virus particles into your upper respiratory tract (URT). This cycle repeats continuously and the rhinovirus has the ability to infect the overwhelming amounts of epithelial cells present in your pharynx. As cells die, the release of protein signalling molecules called cytokines recruit leukocytes (white-blood cells) to the site of infection. Furthermore, there is inflammation within the URT to localize the site of infection preventing it to spread to other areas of the body. As the battle between the exponential growth of the virus and the human leukocytes occurs, the symptoms of the common cold are experienced. Often you experience these symptoms because your immune system is trying to battle the virus and clear the infection. When a virus infects a cell, it often inactivates the movement of these tiny hair-like projections on cells which prevent pathogens from entering your lower respiratory tract (LRT). When the ciliary motion (mucociliary escalator) is inactivated due to the increasing amount cell death, the strength of your coughs and sneezes are used to push these pathogens up and out of your URT. And with that, there is also no generally accepted treatment except over the counter medication to help with symptoms. To prevent catching the virus, it is recommended to avoid people with the cold, wash hands frequently (not use hand sanitizer), and avoid touching your face. Only 1 case of rhinovirus was observed because it is not as harmful to a healthy individual and is often cleared within two weeks. Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to secondary infections which are often caused by other pathogens (such as a bacterial infection) hence, becoming more ill. The lower respiratory tract is sterile and infections in the LRT are often more severe than infections in the URT. Influenza and RSV are both viruses affecting the lower respiratory tract and are far more damaging to the host than rhinovirus. Influenza has an incubation period of roughly 2 days before the onset of symptoms. The symptoms are flu-like and worsen over time with lingering cough, fatigue, and weakness. The pathogenesis of influenza is similar to the rhinovirus as they both multiply within epithelial cells and suppress the mucociliary escalator. There are three types of influenza virus; influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. The letters indicate severity based on the protein coat that the influenza virus possesses. Type A is more severe for humans, as compared to type B and C. Influenza is a unique virus, as it has the ability to change. Influenza has a protein coat which surrounds the genetic material found inside the virus. On the protein coat, influenza has glycoprotein spikes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA glycoproteins are antigens which are often recognised by your immune system as pathogenic. The HA and NA glycoproteins mutate frequently as the virus multiplies over time infecting many individuals. The protein antigens found on the virus in the previous year are completely different from the protein antigens found on the seasonal influenza virus currently, thus making you sick every year. This is known as antigenic drift. The treatment of influenza includes some antiviral mediation, only if it is given at an appropriate time and there are also multivalent vaccines. There have been more reported cases for RSV than influenza and rhinoviruses because it is not necessarily more pathogenic but has a different approach as to how it infects its host and the type of symptoms experienced. The RSV infection is of the LRT and is often more damaging to infants, young children, and the elderly. The pathogenesis of RSV is slightly different from influenza and rhinovirus because although it may also infect epithelium of the respiratory tract, it causes the bronchioles of the lungs to be partially plugged from the dead sloughed cells of the epithelium. The RSV virus has proteins which also allow it to attach and fuse two cells together to hide from the leukocytes of the immune system. Due to the nature of some RSV virus proteins, it can sometimes be fatal for the elderly population that have underlying conditions. Currently, there few effective antiviral medications available for this infection. Many antivirals like ribavirin are only given to people who have contracted severe cases. Doctors will give the premature babies injections of antibodies to RSV so that this vulnerable population develops a passive immunity. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. Signs and symptoms\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission\n\nVirology\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). Pathophysiology\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. Nervous system\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Immunopathology\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Viral and host factors\n\nVirus proteins\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. S2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the H1 and HR2, which are heptad repeat regions. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response. Host factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses. It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. Host cytokine response\n\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID‑19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon. Pregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:\n Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. It adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the fetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. One of them is the total reduction of the lungs' capacity and inability to clear secretions. Coagulation: During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be implicated. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus. In addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life. Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. Diagnosis\n\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection. Viral testing\n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK. DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia. organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis\n plasmocytosis in BAL\n Blood and vessels: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction, endotheliitis, hemophagocytosis\n Heart: cardiac muscle cell necrosis\n Liver: microvesicular steatosis\n Nose: shedding of olfactory epithelium\n Brain: infarction\n Kidneys: acute tubular damage. Prevention\n\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available. So the masks with exhalation valve are not for the infected wearers, and are not reliable to stop the pandemic in a large scale. Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Surface cleaning\nAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes. The amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%). The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation. The CDC says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. Chan School of Public Health recommends a healthy diet, being physically active, managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep. A meta-analysis, published online in October 2021, concluded that \"Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms.\" Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening. Treatment\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achieving herd immunity by infection, rather than vaccination, is \"morally unconscionable and unfeasible\". The average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19. It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. Children\n\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. Complications\n\nComplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. By a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in COVID‑19. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time. Immunity\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. The presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralizing antibody declines with time. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. Infection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected). Sex differences\n\nCOVID‑19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. Comorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. History\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. U.S intelligence agencies found that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and that it is unlikely for it to have been genetically engineered. The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\". Other species\n\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. Compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection. Behaviors which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal. Mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus. The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory. Transmission and prevention research\n\nModelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, diagnosis and prognosis of infection, estimation of the impact of interventions, or allocation of resources. Treatment-related research\n\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. Cytokine storm\n\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible. Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development. The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies. Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade\nThere was a report on 3March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID‑19 caused a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most \n\n be able to transmit from ill people to others. There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: What happens during the 'incubation period'?\nA.

The nutrition program under the 2004 National Nutrition Policy and Strategy promotes exclusive breastfeeding through the age of 6 months and, thereafter, the introduction of semisolid or solid foods along with continued breast milk until the child is at least age 2. Introducing breast milk substitutes to infants before age 6 months can contribute to breastfeeding failure. Nepal's Breast Milk Substitute Act (2049) of 1992 promotes and protects breastfeeding and regulates the unauthorized or unsolicited sale and distribution of breast milk substitutes. After six months, a child requires adequate complementary foods for normal growth. Lack of appropriate complementary feeding may lead to malnutrition and frequent illnesses, which in turn may lead to death. However, even with complementary feeding, the child should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. Breast milk may be  from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and/or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding physiology \n\nBreast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts, fat cells, and connective tissue. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. The third stage of milk production occurs gradually over several weeks, and is characterized by full milk supply that is regulated locally (at the breast), predominately by the infant's demand for food. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy \nChanges in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II \n\nThe third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Colostrum continues to be produced for these next few days, as Lactogenesis II occurs. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. The only way to maintain milk supply is to drain the breasts frequently. Breast milk \n\nThe content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The first type of milk produced is called colostrum. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. The breast milk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs, with the exception of Vitamin D.  The CDC, National Health Service (UK), Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all agree that breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of Vitamin D, thus they advise parents to supplement their infants with 400 IU Vitamin D daily. However, there was insufficient evidence in the most recent Cochrane Review, to determine if this quantity reduced rates of Vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) or Rickets. Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation. Delaying clamping of the cord at birth for at least one minute improves the infants' iron status for the first year. When complementary (solid) foods are introduced at about 6 months of age, parents should make sure to choose iron rich foods to help maintain their children's iron stores. The bioactive makeup of breastmilk also changes based on the needs of the infant; for example, when an infant is recovering from an upper respiratory infection, local signaling allows for increased passage of immune cells and proteins to aid the infant's immune system. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools. Although the baby has received some antibodies (IgG) through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, colostrum and mature breast milk contain many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes and proteins that decrease the risk of gastrointestinal allergies to food, respiratory allergies to air particles like pollen, and other atopic diseases, such as asthma and eczema. Process\n\nCommencement \n\nIt is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth. Uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth, and should continue for at least one hour after birth. This period of infant-mother interaction, known generally as Kangaroo Care, or the \"Golden Hour\" during the immediate postpartum period, assists in the mother-child bonding for both mother and baby, and is thought to encourage instinctual breastfeeding behavior in the infant. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth.Success with breastfeeding in this \"Golden Hour\" increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge. If the mother is unable to immediately hold the baby a family member can provide skin-to-skin care until the mother is able. Breast crawl \nAccording to studies cited by UNICEF, babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed. If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast, called the breast crawl and begins to feed. After feeding, it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting. Rushing, by picking up and moving the infant to the breast, or interrupting the process, such as removing the baby to weigh him/her, may complicate subsequent feeding. Activities such as weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding. Preterm or Low-tone Infants \nChildren who are born preterm (before 37 weeks), children born in the early term period (37 weeks-38 weeks and 6 days), and children born with low muscular tone, such as those with chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or neurological conditions like Cerebral Palsy, may have difficulty in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. Regardless of feeding method chosen, human milk feedings, whether from the mother or a donor, are important in the brain development of premature infants, and the NICU having a standardized protocol for feeding is protective against dangerous gastrointestinal infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) in these infants. Starting to breastfeed may be challenging for mothers of preterm infants, especially those born before 34 weeks, because their breasts may still be developing (in Lactogenesis I, see Breastfeeding Physiology. Additionally, mother-infant separation and the stressful environment of the NICU are also barriers to breastfeeding. Timing \n\nNewborn babies should feed 8-12 times every 24 hours, typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks. A newborn has a very small stomach capacity. The amount of breast milk that is produced is timed to meet the infant's needs in that the first milk; colostrum is concentrated but produced in only very small amounts, gradually increasing in volume to meet the expanding size of the infant's stomach capacity. Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast, however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency. Duration and exclusivity\nNumerous health organizations, including, but not limited to, the CDC, WHO, National Health Service, Canadian Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth, unless medically contraindicated. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as \"an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals and medications.\" Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases, as discussed below. After solids are introduced at around six months of age, continued breastfeeding is recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months, or longer if both the mother and child wish. The World Health Organization's guidelines recommend \"continue[d] frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. In the United States, 22.4% of babies are breastfed for 12 months, the minimum amount of time advised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In India, mothers commonly breastfeed for 2 to 3 years. Supplementation \nSupplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant, in addition to breastmilk, during the first 6 months of life. Supplementation should only be used when medically indicated and when overseen by a medical professional, such as a pediatrician or family physician, and after consultation with a lactation counselor (CLC or IBCLC). Indications for use of donor breastmilk are very closely outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Due to low availability and high cost of donor breastmilk, the AAP recommends prioritizing the use of the milk for infants born with a weight of less than 1500g (approximately 3lb 5oz), as it is helpful in decreasing rates of the severe intestinal infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, in this population. The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows. Sometimes the let-down is so strong that the baby splutters and coughs and the mother may need to remove the baby from her breast for a short time until the flow becomes less forceful. Problems with Breastfeeding\n\nInverted nipples \n\nInfants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort. Ankyloglossia \n\nAnkyloglossia, also called \"tongue-tie\" may cause shallow latch, poor milk transfer, and other problems with breastfeeding. Additionally, the birth of an infant is followed by massive fluid shifts to both offload excess fluid, which had been used to supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetus through the placenta, which is no longer needed, and supply additional fluid to the breasts in order to start the process of making milk. Delay in milk \"coming in\" \n\nWhile milk normally \"comes in\" by 5 days after birth, there are several reasons this may be delayed. Mothers experiencing a delay in their milk coming in should consult with a lactation specialist and their pediatrician, as they may need to supplement with donor milk or formula to help the infant gain weight. Low milk supply \n\nBreast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. These reasons may include fussiness, colic, preference for the bottle as opposed to the breast, long nursing duration, decreased sensation of breast fulness, and even decreased frequency of infant stools. However, in these cases, it important to reassure the parent that infant gain is absolute proof of adequate milk intake. Thus, if the infant breastfeeding exclusively, and is gaining weight appropriately, then the parent can be reassured that they are producing enough milk. On the contrary, there are many causes of true low milk supply, and these causes can manifest prior to pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Poor milk intake is signaled by poor infant weight gain, signs of dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Poor milk intake can be caused by poor milk transfer by the infant or by true low milk supply by the mother. When the milk \"comes in\" appropriately, but is followed by decreased milk supply, this is most often caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. If the baby is latching and swallowing well (signs of good milk transfer), but is not gaining weight as expected or is showing signs of dehydration, low milk supply in the mother can be suspected, and a lactation specialist should be consulted. Newborn jaundice\n\nMore than 80% of newborns develop jaundice within several days of birth. By continuing to breastfeed frequently (start at 8-12 times per day), the infant's body can usually rid itself of the bilirubin excess by encouraging more urine and stool production. However, in some cases, the infant may need additional treatments, such as UV light therapy or additional feedings (see Supplementation) to keep the condition from progressing into more severe problems. There are two types of newborn jaundice related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and may occur in the first week of life in conjunction with ongoing weight loss. While there is some argument that decreased volume of intake in breastfed infants leads to decreased excretion of bilirubin through the stool (due to decreased number of stools), recent data actually seems to reject this notion, as it was found that there is no significant difference in stool production between formula-fed and breast fed infants. On the contrary, formula-fed infants tend to lose less weight after birth compared to breastfed infants, supporting the hypothesis that breastfeeding jaundice is related to caloric intake rather than volume intake. Breast milk jaundice is jaundice that persists despite appropriate weight gain. This type of jaundice may start as breastfeeding jaundice and persist, or may not appear until after the baby has begun to gain weight, typically around 4–5 days old. There is no single cause of breast milk jaundice; rather, the causes are multifactorial and frequently debated in the literature. Breast milk jaundice is usually not a reason to stop nursing. Weaning \n\nWeaning is the process of replacing breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually increase the period between feedings and/or eliminate feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. La Leche League advises parents to shift their children's focus at bedtime away from breastfeeding, as it is often the most difficult feeding for them to let go. If the mother was experiencing lactational amenorrhea her periods will begin to return as she begins to wean, along with the return of her fertility. Contraindications to Breastfeeding\n\nMaternal Contraindications \nMedical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are fairly rare. Infants that are otherwise healthy uniformly benefit from breastfeeding, however, extra precautions should be taken or breastfeeding  avoided in circumstances including certain infectious diseases and medical conditions. Factors such as the mother's viral load complicate breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers. The World Health Organization highlights the possibility of breastfeeding in mothers on anti-viral therapy and with undetectable viral loads, especially in areas where access to clean water is poor and where death from infectious diseases is common, citing low transmission rates when the mother is on anti-viral therapy. They also recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted by their maternal and child health services to best avoid HIV transmission from mother to child. However, the CDC continues to recommend against HIV-positive mothers breastfeeding in the United States. Infant formula should only be given if this can be safely done. The worldwide rate of transmission through breastmilk is estimated to be 3.9-27%, and this risk is increased by high maternal viral load and prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Current data demonstrates that while breastfeeding for less than six months does not, independently, increase risk of HTLV-1 transmission, not breastfeeding during that time does decrease risk of transmission. As such, CDC recommends against breastfeeding when mothers have HTLV Types I or II. Recognizing the importance of breastfeeding in more resource-poor areas of the world, the World Health Organization recommends shortening the duration of breastfeeding, or avoiding breastfeeding where possible. Hemorrhagic viral disease (Marburg virus, Ebola) \nMothers with Marburg virus or Ebola should not breastfeed their infants or feed them with expressed breastmilk. As such, these infants should not be breastfed during this time and until the mother has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. However, these infants may be fed expressed breastmilk from their mother. Transmission of TB through breastmilk, without an isolated breast infection caused by the Tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has never been documented in the scientific literature. Mothers who do have an isolated breast infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed tuberculous mastitis, should not feed their infants with their own breastmilk, even if it is fed by bottle. The CDC advises that breastfeeding is safe to continue as long as the breasts are clear of lesions, also emphasizing that if pumping or hand expressing milk, proper hand-hygiene should be used to minimize transfer. Substance Use \nTobacco: Mothers who smoke or use other tobacco products can breastfeed their infants, according to La Leche League, the CDC, and the Royal Women's Hospital (Australia) However, it is important to note that maternal tobacco use may decrease milk supply. Additionally, tobacco smoking, regardless of feeding method, increases risk of SIDS and respiratory illnesses. Many medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts, however, very few medications actually reach the infant and are absorbed in a way that would actually impact the infant. In addition to the effects on the infant, many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. Patients should be encouraged to consult a lactation specialist or a medical provider trained in breastfeeding medicine if any concerns arise. Pumping-and-dumping, or stopping breastfeeding altogether, is only required in very rare circumstances, such as with radioactive medications or chemotherapy. If a parent is concerned with a possible milk contaminant, they can express and save the breastmilk until they are able to consult with a lactation specialist or another medical professional trained in breastfeeding medicine. Mothers who have suspected or confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 should thoroughly wash their hands and wear a well-fitting mask prior to breastfeeding their infant, or express breastmilk and feed the infant by bottle. Infantile Contraindications\n\nGalactosemia \nGalactosemia is a metabolic disorder that prevents the infant from breaking down galactose, which is one of the two components of lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. Mothers express milk for multiple reasons. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Maternal breastmilk is the food of choice for premature babies; these infants may be fed maternal milk through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. While informally-shared breastmilk does carry the nutritional benefits of breastmilk, this breastmilk is most often not pasteurized or screened, and thus carries with it the risk of transmitting diseases or medications that are unsafe for infants. Parents considering directed or informal milk sharing should discuss this option with their doctor, and they should be familiar with the donors medical history and milk handling practices. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. While some infants do experience this preference for the bottle, many infants do not and will be able to alternate between bottle and breast without issue. However, from available evidence, it appears to be fairly uncommon, with only approximately 7% of study participants reporting exclusive pumping. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. While some children continue to breastfeed even with this change, others may wean. Most mothers can produce enough milk for tandem nursing, but the new baby should be nursed first for at least the first few days after delivery to ensure that it receives enough colostrum. Breastfeeding triplets or larger broods is a challenge given babies' varying appetites. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding. Re-lactation is most easily accomplished with a newborn or with a baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she is more likely to be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Techniques to promote lactation use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. A dropper or syringe without the needle may be used to place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. However, even when lactation is established, the supply may not be large enough to breastfeed exclusively. Parents and other family members should watch the baby's weight gain and urine output to assess nutritional adequacy. A WHO manual for physicians and senior health workers citing a 1992 source states:  \"If a baby has been breastfeeding sometimes, the breastmilk supply increases in a few days. If a baby has stopped breastfeeding, it may take 1-2 weeks or more before much breastmilk comes.\" Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that builds community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds. WHO states, \"Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.\" Baby \n\nEarly breastfeeding is associated with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, childhood lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, or childhood leukemia later in life. The CDC reports that infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of ear infections, obesity, type 1 diabetes, asthma, SIDS, and lower respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections. Comparing breastfed and non-breastfed siblings in a given family drastically decreases the association between breasfeeding and long-term child well-being. Growth \n\nThe average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby weighs about  times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula-fed babies, which improves long-run health. The Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition and Growth (DARLING) study reported that breastfed and formula-fed groups had similar weight gain during the first 3 months, but the breastfed babies began to drop below the median beginning at 6 to 8 months and were significantly lower weight than the formula-fed group between 6 and 18 months. Infections \n\nBreast milk contains several anti-infective factors such as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and lactoferrin (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria). Exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age helps to protect an infant from gastrointestinal infections in both developing and industrialized countries. The risk of death due to diarrhea and other infections increases when babies are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to die of gastrointestinal infections than infants who switched from exclusive to partial breastfeeding at three to four months. During breastfeeding, approximately 0.25–0.5 grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to the baby via milk. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. Mortality \n\nBabies who receive no breast milk are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than those who are partially or fully breastfed. A 2013 longitudinal study reported less obesity at ages two and four years among infants who were breastfed for at least four months. Allergic diseases \n\nIn children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist. Other health effects \n\nBreastfeeding may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). About 14 to 19 percent of leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for six months or longer. However, breastfeeding is also the primary cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as the HTLV-1 virus is transmitted through breastmilk. Breastfeeding is associated with a lower chance of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 in the offspring. Breastfed babies also appear to have a lower likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Breastfed infants have somewhat lower blood pressure later in life, but it is unclear how much practical benefit this provides. A 1998 study suggested that breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. Breastfeeding duration has been correlated with child maltreatment outcomes, including neglect and sexual abuse. However, other studies concluded that breastfeeding was associated with increased cognitive development in childhood, although the cause may be increased mother–child interaction rather than nutrition. Fertility \n\nExclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through lactational amenorrhea, although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. This has been used as natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed. When the newborn nurses  the mother secretes oxytocin which causes  the uterus to cramp and reduce blood loss. Nursing also causes the uterus to cramp for a number of days postpartum, helping it to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Weight retention\n\nIt is unclear whether breastfeeding causes mothers to lose weight after giving birth. Chronic conditions \nBreastfeeding is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among mothers who practice it. According to the American Heart Association, breastfeeding also reduces the risk of maternal heart disease and stroke. A 2011 review found it unclear whether breastfeeding affects the risk of postpartum depression. Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\n\nDysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is a condition in which breastfeeding women develop negative emotions that begin just before the milk letdown reflex and last less than a few minutes. Many hospitals have instituted practices that encourage breastfeeding, however a 2012 survey in the US found that 24% of maternity services were still providing supplements of commercial infant formula as a general practice in the first 48 hours after birth. This review contrasts with another large review that looked at education programs alone, which found no conclusive evidence of initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. An increase in these capacities of support has shown to greatly positively effect breastfeeding rates, especially among women with education below a high school level. Mother – Adolescence is a risk factor for low breastfeeding rates, although classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can help compensate. Breast surgery\nBreastfeeding can generally be attempted after breast augmentation or reduction surgery, however prior breast surgery is a risk factor for low milk supply. A 2014 review found that women who have breast implant surgery were less likely to exclusively breast feed, however it was based on only three small studies and the reasons for the correlation were not clear. Medications \n\nBreastfeeding mothers should inform their healthcare provider about all of the medications they are taking, including herbal products. Nursing mothers may be immunized and may take most over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs without risk to the baby but certain drugs, including some painkillers and some psychiatric drugs, may pose a risk. Some substances in the mother's food and drink are passed to the baby through breast milk, including mercury (found in some carnivorous fish), caffeine, and bisphenol A. Medical conditions \n\nUndiagnosed maternal celiac disease may cause a short duration of the breastfeeding period. Mothers with all types of diabetes mellitus normally use insulin to control their blood sugar, as the safety of other antidiabetic drugs while breastfeeding is unknown. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with some hormonal differences and obesity, may have greater difficulty with producing a sufficient supply to support exclusive breastfeeding, especially during the first weeks. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status \n\nThe rates of breastfeeding in the African-American community remain much lower than any other race, for a variety of proposed reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, higher rates of poor perinatal health, higher stress levels, less access to support, and less flexibility in the workplace. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class. Comparing facilities in primarily African American neighborhoods to ones in primarily White neighborhoods, the rates of practices that support or discourage breastfeeding were: limited use of supplements (13.1% compared with 25.8%) and rooming-in (27.7–39.4%)\n\nLow-income mothers are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The use of infant formula was thought to be a way for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding mothers may feel that they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. The authors advocate that women be provided with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills, however there is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding education alone improves initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. Prevalence \n\nGlobally about 38% of babies are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States the rate of women beginning to breastfeed was 76% in 2009 increasing to 83% in 2015 with 58% still breastfeeding at 6 months, although only 25% were still breastfeeding exclusively. African-American women have persistently low rates of breastfeeding compared to White and Hispanic American women. In 2014, 58.1% of African-American women breastfeed in the early postpartum period, compared to 77.7% of White women and 80.6% of Hispanic women. Breastfeeding rates in different parts of China vary considerably. Rates in the United Kingdom were the lowest in the world in 2015 with only 0.5% of mothers still breastfeeding at a year, while in Germany 23% are doing so, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. In Australia for children born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada for children born in 2005–06, more than 50% were only breastfed and more than 15% received both breastmilk and other liquids, by the age of 3 months. The appearance of improved infant formulas in the mid 19th century and its increased use caused a decrease in breastfeeding rates, which accelerated after World War II, and for some in the US, Canada, and UK, breastfeeding was seen as uncultured. Parents of breastfed babies are less likely to miss work and lose income because their babies are sick. Looking at three of the most common infant illnesses, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and gastrointestinal illness, one study compared infants that had been exclusively breastfed for at least three months to those who had not. It found that in the first year of life there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. In addition to this, there is also the moral question as to what degree the state or medical community can interfere with the self-determination of a woman: for example in the United Arab Emirates the law requires a woman to breastfeed her baby for at least 2 years and allows her husband to sue her if she does not do so. Preventing a situation where women are denied agency and/or stigmatized for formula use is also seen as important. In 2018, in the UK, a policy statement from the Royal College of Midwives said that women should be supported and not stigmatized, if  after being given advice and information, they choose to formula feed. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has reported that women who receive formula samples at discharge are associated with lower breastfeeding rates than those who did not receive gift bags. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative \n\nThe Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a program launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with UNICEF in order to promote infant feeding and maternal bonding through certified hospitals and birthing centers. BFHI was developed as a response to the influence held by formula companies in private and public maternal health care.The initiative has two core tenets: the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In the United States the CDC reports on a study that \"examined the effect of corporate lactation programs on breastfeeding behavior among employed women in California [which] included prenatal classes, perinatal counseling, and lactation management after the return to work\". They found that \"about 75% of mothers in the lactation programs continued breastfeeding at least 6 months, although nationally only 10% of mothers employed full-time who initiated breastfeeding were still breastfeeding at 6 months.\" Research \n\nBreastfeeding research continues to assess prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes.

Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is the recommended way of feeding infants, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to 2 years or beyond. As per the study carried out in Paropakar Maternity & Women's Hospital, Thapathali, 2017, the participants of normal delivery had an opportunity to breastfeed within an hour while almost all participants going through C-section were not offered to do so. The reason for participants to not practice breastfeeding within an hour were mother's sickness, unable to hold the baby due to suture, baby taken away from mother, and less or no production of breast milk soon after surgery to feed the child. Breast milk may be  from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and/or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding physiology \n\nBreast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts, fat cells, and connective tissue. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. The third stage of milk production occurs gradually over several weeks, and is characterized by full milk supply that is regulated locally (at the breast), predominately by the infant's demand for food. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy \nChanges in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II \n\nThe third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Colostrum continues to be produced for these next few days, as Lactogenesis II occurs. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. The only way to maintain milk supply is to drain the breasts frequently. Breast milk \n\nThe content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The first type of milk produced is called colostrum. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. The breast milk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs, with the exception of Vitamin D.  The CDC, National Health Service (UK), Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all agree that breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of Vitamin D, thus they advise parents to supplement their infants with 400 IU Vitamin D daily. However, there was insufficient evidence in the most recent Cochrane Review, to determine if this quantity reduced rates of Vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) or Rickets. Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation. Delaying clamping of the cord at birth for at least one minute improves the infants' iron status for the first year. When complementary (solid) foods are introduced at about 6 months of age, parents should make sure to choose iron rich foods to help maintain their children's iron stores. The bioactive makeup of breastmilk also changes based on the needs of the infant; for example, when an infant is recovering from an upper respiratory infection, local signaling allows for increased passage of immune cells and proteins to aid the infant's immune system. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools. Although the baby has received some antibodies (IgG) through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, colostrum and mature breast milk contain many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes and proteins that decrease the risk of gastrointestinal allergies to food, respiratory allergies to air particles like pollen, and other atopic diseases, such as asthma and eczema. Process\n\nCommencement \n\nIt is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth. Uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth, and should continue for at least one hour after birth. This period of infant-mother interaction, known generally as Kangaroo Care, or the \"Golden Hour\" during the immediate postpartum period, assists in the mother-child bonding for both mother and baby, and is thought to encourage instinctual breastfeeding behavior in the infant. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth.Success with breastfeeding in this \"Golden Hour\" increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge. If the mother is unable to immediately hold the baby a family member can provide skin-to-skin care until the mother is able. Breast crawl \nAccording to studies cited by UNICEF, babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed. If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast, called the breast crawl and begins to feed. After feeding, it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting. Rushing, by picking up and moving the infant to the breast, or interrupting the process, such as removing the baby to weigh him/her, may complicate subsequent feeding. Activities such as weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding. Preterm or Low-tone Infants \nChildren who are born preterm (before 37 weeks), children born in the early term period (37 weeks-38 weeks and 6 days), and children born with low muscular tone, such as those with chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or neurological conditions like Cerebral Palsy, may have difficulty in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. Regardless of feeding method chosen, human milk feedings, whether from the mother or a donor, are important in the brain development of premature infants, and the NICU having a standardized protocol for feeding is protective against dangerous gastrointestinal infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) in these infants. Starting to breastfeed may be challenging for mothers of preterm infants, especially those born before 34 weeks, because their breasts may still be developing (in Lactogenesis I, see Breastfeeding Physiology. Additionally, mother-infant separation and the stressful environment of the NICU are also barriers to breastfeeding. Timing \n\nNewborn babies should feed 8-12 times every 24 hours, typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks. A newborn has a very small stomach capacity. The amount of breast milk that is produced is timed to meet the infant's needs in that the first milk; colostrum is concentrated but produced in only very small amounts, gradually increasing in volume to meet the expanding size of the infant's stomach capacity. Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast, however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency. Duration and exclusivity\nNumerous health organizations, including, but not limited to, the CDC, WHO, National Health Service, Canadian Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth, unless medically contraindicated. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as \"an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals and medications.\" Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases, as discussed below. After solids are introduced at around six months of age, continued breastfeeding is recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months, or longer if both the mother and child wish. The World Health Organization's guidelines recommend \"continue[d] frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. In the United States, 22.4% of babies are breastfed for 12 months, the minimum amount of time advised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In India, mothers commonly breastfeed for 2 to 3 years. Supplementation \nSupplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant, in addition to breastmilk, during the first 6 months of life. Supplementation should only be used when medically indicated and when overseen by a medical professional, such as a pediatrician or family physician, and after consultation with a lactation counselor (CLC or IBCLC). Indications for use of donor breastmilk are very closely outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Due to low availability and high cost of donor breastmilk, the AAP recommends prioritizing the use of the milk for infants born with a weight of less than 1500g (approximately 3lb 5oz), as it is helpful in decreasing rates of the severe intestinal infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, in this population. The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows. Sometimes the let-down is so strong that the baby splutters and coughs and the mother may need to remove the baby from her breast for a short time until the flow becomes less forceful. Problems with Breastfeeding\n\nInverted nipples \n\nInfants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort. Ankyloglossia \n\nAnkyloglossia, also called \"tongue-tie\" may cause shallow latch, poor milk transfer, and other problems with breastfeeding. Additionally, the birth of an infant is followed by massive fluid shifts to both offload excess fluid, which had been used to supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetus through the placenta, which is no longer needed, and supply additional fluid to the breasts in order to start the process of making milk. Delay in milk \"coming in\" \n\nWhile milk normally \"comes in\" by 5 days after birth, there are several reasons this may be delayed. Mothers experiencing a delay in their milk coming in should consult with a lactation specialist and their pediatrician, as they may need to supplement with donor milk or formula to help the infant gain weight. Low milk supply \n\nBreast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. These reasons may include fussiness, colic, preference for the bottle as opposed to the breast, long nursing duration, decreased sensation of breast fulness, and even decreased frequency of infant stools. However, in these cases, it important to reassure the parent that infant gain is absolute proof of adequate milk intake. Thus, if the infant breastfeeding exclusively, and is gaining weight appropriately, then the parent can be reassured that they are producing enough milk. On the contrary, there are many causes of true low milk supply, and these causes can manifest prior to pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Poor milk intake is signaled by poor infant weight gain, signs of dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Poor milk intake can be caused by poor milk transfer by the infant or by true low milk supply by the mother. When the milk \"comes in\" appropriately, but is followed by decreased milk supply, this is most often caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. If the baby is latching and swallowing well (signs of good milk transfer), but is not gaining weight as expected or is showing signs of dehydration, low milk supply in the mother can be suspected, and a lactation specialist should be consulted. Newborn jaundice\n\nMore than 80% of newborns develop jaundice within several days of birth. By continuing to breastfeed frequently (start at 8-12 times per day), the infant's body can usually rid itself of the bilirubin excess by encouraging more urine and stool production. However, in some cases, the infant may need additional treatments, such as UV light therapy or additional feedings (see Supplementation) to keep the condition from progressing into more severe problems. There are two types of newborn jaundice related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and may occur in the first week of life in conjunction with ongoing weight loss. While there is some argument that decreased volume of intake in breastfed infants leads to decreased excretion of bilirubin through the stool (due to decreased number of stools), recent data actually seems to reject this notion, as it was found that there is no significant difference in stool production between formula-fed and breast fed infants. On the contrary, formula-fed infants tend to lose less weight after birth compared to breastfed infants, supporting the hypothesis that breastfeeding jaundice is related to caloric intake rather than volume intake. Breast milk jaundice is jaundice that persists despite appropriate weight gain. This type of jaundice may start as breastfeeding jaundice and persist, or may not appear until after the baby has begun to gain weight, typically around 4–5 days old. There is no single cause of breast milk jaundice; rather, the causes are multifactorial and frequently debated in the literature. Breast milk jaundice is usually not a reason to stop nursing. Weaning \n\nWeaning is the process of replacing breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually increase the period between feedings and/or eliminate feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. La Leche League advises parents to shift their children's focus at bedtime away from breastfeeding, as it is often the most difficult feeding for them to let go. If the mother was experiencing lactational amenorrhea her periods will begin to return as she begins to wean, along with the return of her fertility. Contraindications to Breastfeeding\n\nMaternal Contraindications \nMedical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are fairly rare. Infants that are otherwise healthy uniformly benefit from breastfeeding, however, extra precautions should be taken or breastfeeding  avoided in circumstances including certain infectious diseases and medical conditions. Factors such as the mother's viral load complicate breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers. The World Health Organization highlights the possibility of breastfeeding in mothers on anti-viral therapy and with undetectable viral loads, especially in areas where access to clean water is poor and where death from infectious diseases is common, citing low transmission rates when the mother is on anti-viral therapy. They also recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted by their maternal and child health services to best avoid HIV transmission from mother to child. However, the CDC continues to recommend against HIV-positive mothers breastfeeding in the United States. Infant formula should only be given if this can be safely done. The worldwide rate of transmission through breastmilk is estimated to be 3.9-27%, and this risk is increased by high maternal viral load and prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Current data demonstrates that while breastfeeding for less than six months does not, independently, increase risk of HTLV-1 transmission, not breastfeeding during that time does decrease risk of transmission. As such, CDC recommends against breastfeeding when mothers have HTLV Types I or II. Recognizing the importance of breastfeeding in more resource-poor areas of the world, the World Health Organization recommends shortening the duration of breastfeeding, or avoiding breastfeeding where possible. Hemorrhagic viral disease (Marburg virus, Ebola) \nMothers with Marburg virus or Ebola should not breastfeed their infants or feed them with expressed breastmilk. As such, these infants should not be breastfed during this time and until the mother has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. However, these infants may be fed expressed breastmilk from their mother. Transmission of TB through breastmilk, without an isolated breast infection caused by the Tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has never been documented in the scientific literature. Mothers who do have an isolated breast infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed tuberculous mastitis, should not feed their infants with their own breastmilk, even if it is fed by bottle. The CDC advises that breastfeeding is safe to continue as long as the breasts are clear of lesions, also emphasizing that if pumping or hand expressing milk, proper hand-hygiene should be used to minimize transfer. Substance Use \nTobacco: Mothers who smoke or use other tobacco products can breastfeed their infants, according to La Leche League, the CDC, and the Royal Women's Hospital (Australia) However, it is important to note that maternal tobacco use may decrease milk supply. Additionally, tobacco smoking, regardless of feeding method, increases risk of SIDS and respiratory illnesses. Many medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts, however, very few medications actually reach the infant and are absorbed in a way that would actually impact the infant. In addition to the effects on the infant, many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. Patients should be encouraged to consult a lactation specialist or a medical provider trained in breastfeeding medicine if any concerns arise. Pumping-and-dumping, or stopping breastfeeding altogether, is only required in very rare circumstances, such as with radioactive medications or chemotherapy. If a parent is concerned with a possible milk contaminant, they can express and save the breastmilk until they are able to consult with a lactation specialist or another medical professional trained in breastfeeding medicine. Mothers who have suspected or confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 should thoroughly wash their hands and wear a well-fitting mask prior to breastfeeding their infant, or express breastmilk and feed the infant by bottle. Infantile Contraindications\n\nGalactosemia \nGalactosemia is a metabolic disorder that prevents the infant from breaking down galactose, which is one of the two components of lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. Mothers express milk for multiple reasons. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Maternal breastmilk is the food of choice for premature babies; these infants may be fed maternal milk through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. While informally-shared breastmilk does carry the nutritional benefits of breastmilk, this breastmilk is most often not pasteurized or screened, and thus carries with it the risk of transmitting diseases or medications that are unsafe for infants. Parents considering directed or informal milk sharing should discuss this option with their doctor, and they should be familiar with the donors medical history and milk handling practices. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. While some infants do experience this preference for the bottle, many infants do not and will be able to alternate between bottle and breast without issue. However, from available evidence, it appears to be fairly uncommon, with only approximately 7% of study participants reporting exclusive pumping. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. While some children continue to breastfeed even with this change, others may wean. Most mothers can produce enough milk for tandem nursing, but the new baby should be nursed first for at least the first few days after delivery to ensure that it receives enough colostrum. Breastfeeding triplets or larger broods is a challenge given babies' varying appetites. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding. Re-lactation is most easily accomplished with a newborn or with a baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she is more likely to be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Techniques to promote lactation use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. A dropper or syringe without the needle may be used to place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. However, even when lactation is established, the supply may not be large enough to breastfeed exclusively. Parents and other family members should watch the baby's weight gain and urine output to assess nutritional adequacy. A WHO manual for physicians and senior health workers citing a 1992 source states:  \"If a baby has been breastfeeding sometimes, the breastmilk supply increases in a few days. If a baby has stopped breastfeeding, it may take 1-2 weeks or more before much breastmilk comes.\" Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that builds community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds. WHO states, \"Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.\" Baby \n\nEarly breastfeeding is associated with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, childhood lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, or childhood leukemia later in life. The CDC reports that infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of ear infections, obesity, type 1 diabetes, asthma, SIDS, and lower respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections. Comparing breastfed and non-breastfed siblings in a given family drastically decreases the association between breasfeeding and long-term child well-being. Growth \n\nThe average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby weighs about  times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula-fed babies, which improves long-run health. The Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition and Growth (DARLING) study reported that breastfed and formula-fed groups had similar weight gain during the first 3 months, but the breastfed babies began to drop below the median beginning at 6 to 8 months and were significantly lower weight than the formula-fed group between 6 and 18 months. Infections \n\nBreast milk contains several anti-infective factors such as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and lactoferrin (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria). Exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age helps to protect an infant from gastrointestinal infections in both developing and industrialized countries. The risk of death due to diarrhea and other infections increases when babies are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to die of gastrointestinal infections than infants who switched from exclusive to partial breastfeeding at three to four months. During breastfeeding, approximately 0.25–0.5 grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to the baby via milk. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. Mortality \n\nBabies who receive no breast milk are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than those who are partially or fully breastfed. A 2013 longitudinal study reported less obesity at ages two and four years among infants who were breastfed for at least four months. Allergic diseases \n\nIn children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist. Other health effects \n\nBreastfeeding may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). About 14 to 19 percent of leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for six months or longer. However, breastfeeding is also the primary cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as the HTLV-1 virus is transmitted through breastmilk. Breastfeeding is associated with a lower chance of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 in the offspring. Breastfed babies also appear to have a lower likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Breastfeeding may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life, as indicated by lower cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels in breastfed adult women. Breastfed infants have somewhat lower blood pressure later in life, but it is unclear how much practical benefit this provides. A 1998 study suggested that breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. Breastfeeding duration has been correlated with child maltreatment outcomes, including neglect and sexual abuse. However, other studies concluded that breastfeeding was associated with increased cognitive development in childhood, although the cause may be increased mother–child interaction rather than nutrition. Fertility \n\nExclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through lactational amenorrhea, although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. This has been used as natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed. When the newborn nurses  the mother secretes oxytocin which causes  the uterus to cramp and reduce blood loss. Nursing also causes the uterus to cramp for a number of days postpartum, helping it to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Weight retention\n\nIt is unclear whether breastfeeding causes mothers to lose weight after giving birth. Chronic conditions \nBreastfeeding is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among mothers who practice it. According to the American Heart Association, breastfeeding also reduces the risk of maternal heart disease and stroke. A 2011 review found it unclear whether breastfeeding affects the risk of postpartum depression. Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\n\nDysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is a condition in which breastfeeding women develop negative emotions that begin just before the milk letdown reflex and last less than a few minutes. Many hospitals have instituted practices that encourage breastfeeding, however a 2012 survey in the US found that 24% of maternity services were still providing supplements of commercial infant formula as a general practice in the first 48 hours after birth. This review contrasts with another large review that looked at education programs alone, which found no conclusive evidence of initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. An increase in these capacities of support has shown to greatly positively effect breastfeeding rates, especially among women with education below a high school level. Mother – Adolescence is a risk factor for low breastfeeding rates, although classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can help compensate. Breast surgery\nBreastfeeding can generally be attempted after breast augmentation or reduction surgery, however prior breast surgery is a risk factor for low milk supply. A 2014 review found that women who have breast implant surgery were less likely to exclusively breast feed, however it was based on only three small studies and the reasons for the correlation were not clear. Medications \n\nBreastfeeding mothers should inform their healthcare provider about all of the medications they are taking, including herbal products. Nursing mothers may be immunized and may take most over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs without risk to the baby but certain drugs, including some painkillers and some psychiatric drugs, may pose a risk. Some substances in the mother's food and drink are passed to the baby through breast milk, including mercury (found in some carnivorous fish), caffeine, and bisphenol A. Medical conditions \n\nUndiagnosed maternal celiac disease may cause a short duration of the breastfeeding period. Mothers with all types of diabetes mellitus normally use insulin to control their blood sugar, as the safety of other antidiabetic drugs while breastfeeding is unknown. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with some hormonal differences and obesity, may have greater difficulty with producing a sufficient supply to support exclusive breastfeeding, especially during the first weeks. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status \n\nThe rates of breastfeeding in the African-American community remain much lower than any other race, for a variety of proposed reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, higher rates of poor perinatal health, higher stress levels, less access to support, and less flexibility in the workplace. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class. Comparing facilities in primarily African American neighborhoods to ones in primarily White neighborhoods, the rates of practices that support or discourage breastfeeding were: limited use of supplements (13.1% compared with 25.8%) and rooming-in (27.7–39.4%)\n\nLow-income mothers are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The use of infant formula was thought to be a way for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding mothers may feel that they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. The authors advocate that women be provided with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills, however there is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding education alone improves initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. Prevalence \n\nGlobally about 38% of babies are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States the rate of women beginning to breastfeed was 76% in 2009 increasing to 83% in 2015 with 58% still breastfeeding at 6 months, although only 25% were still breastfeeding exclusively. African-American women have persistently low rates of breastfeeding compared to White and Hispanic American women. In 2014, 58.1% of African-American women breastfeed in the early postpartum period, compared to 77.7% of White women and 80.6% of Hispanic women. Breastfeeding rates in different parts of China vary considerably. Rates in the United Kingdom were the lowest in the world in 2015 with only 0.5% of mothers still breastfeeding at a year, while in Germany 23% are doing so, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. In Australia for children born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada for children born in 2005–06, more than 50% were only breastfed and more than 15% received both breastmilk and other liquids, by the age of 3 months. The appearance of improved infant formulas in the mid 19th century and its increased use caused a decrease in breastfeeding rates, which accelerated after World War II, and for some in the US, Canada, and UK, breastfeeding was seen as uncultured. Parents of breastfed babies are less likely to miss work and lose income because their babies are sick. Looking at three of the most common infant illnesses, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and gastrointestinal illness, one study compared infants that had been exclusively breastfed for at least three months to those who had not. It found that in the first year of life there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. In addition to this, there is also the moral question as to what degree the state or medical community can interfere with the self-determination of a woman: for example in the United Arab Emirates the law requires a woman to breastfeed her baby for at least 2 years and allows her husband to sue her if she does not do so. Preventing a situation where women are denied agency and/or stigmatized for formula use is also seen as important. In 2018, in the UK, a policy statement from the Royal College of Midwives said that women should be supported and not stigmatized, if  after being given advice and information, they choose to formula feed. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has reported that women who receive formula samples at discharge are associated with lower breastfeeding rates than those who did not receive gift bags. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative \n\nThe Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a program launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with UNICEF in order to promote infant feeding and maternal bonding through certified hospitals and birthing centers. BFHI was developed as a response to the influence held by formula companies in private and public maternal health care.The initiative has two core tenets: the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In the United States the CDC reports on a study that \"examined the effect of corporate lactation programs on breastfeeding behavior among employed women in California [which] included prenatal classes, perinatal counseling, and lactation management after the return to work\". They found that \"about 75% of mothers in the lactation programs continued breastfeeding at least 6 months, although nationally only 10% of mothers employed full-time who initiated breastfeeding were still breastfeeding at 6 months.\" Research \n\nBreastfeeding research continues to assess prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes.

Breast milk may be  from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and/or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding physiology \n\nBreast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts, fat cells, and connective tissue. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. The third stage of milk production occurs gradually over several weeks, and is characterized by full milk supply that is regulated locally (at the breast), predominately by the infant's demand for food. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy \nChanges in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II \n\nThe third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Colostrum continues to be produced for these next few days, as Lactogenesis II occurs. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. The only way to maintain milk supply is to drain the breasts frequently. Breast milk \n\nThe content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The first type of milk produced is called colostrum. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. The breast milk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs, with the exception of Vitamin D.  The CDC, National Health Service (UK), Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all agree that breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of Vitamin D, thus they advise parents to supplement their infants with 400 IU Vitamin D daily. However, there was insufficient evidence in the most recent Cochrane Review, to determine if this quantity reduced rates of Vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) or Rickets. Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation. Delaying clamping of the cord at birth for at least one minute improves the infants' iron status for the first year. When complementary (solid) foods are introduced at about 6 months of age, parents should make sure to choose iron rich foods to help maintain their children's iron stores. The bioactive makeup of breastmilk also changes based on the needs of the infant; for example, when an infant is recovering from an upper respiratory infection, local signaling allows for increased passage of immune cells and proteins to aid the infant's immune system. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools. Although the baby has received some antibodies (IgG) through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, colostrum and mature breast milk contain many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes and proteins that decrease the risk of gastrointestinal allergies to food, respiratory allergies to air particles like pollen, and other atopic diseases, such as asthma and eczema. Process\n\nCommencement \n\nIt is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth. Uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth, and should continue for at least one hour after birth. This period of infant-mother interaction, known generally as Kangaroo Care, or the \"Golden Hour\" during the immediate postpartum period, assists in the mother-child bonding for both mother and baby, and is thought to encourage instinctual breastfeeding behavior in the infant. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth.Success with breastfeeding in this \"Golden Hour\" increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge. If the mother is unable to immediately hold the baby a family member can provide skin-to-skin care until the mother is able. Breast crawl \nAccording to studies cited by UNICEF, babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed. If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast, called the breast crawl and begins to feed. After feeding, it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting. Rushing, by picking up and moving the infant to the breast, or interrupting the process, such as removing the baby to weigh him/her, may complicate subsequent feeding. Activities such as weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding. Preterm or Low-tone Infants \nChildren who are born preterm (before 37 weeks), children born in the early term period (37 weeks-38 weeks and 6 days), and children born with low muscular tone, such as those with chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or neurological conditions like Cerebral Palsy, may have difficulty in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. Regardless of feeding method chosen, human milk feedings, whether from the mother or a donor, are important in the brain development of premature infants, and the NICU having a standardized protocol for feeding is protective against dangerous gastrointestinal infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) in these infants. Starting to breastfeed may be challenging for mothers of preterm infants, especially those born before 34 weeks, because their breasts may still be developing (in Lactogenesis I, see Breastfeeding Physiology. Additionally, mother-infant separation and the stressful environment of the NICU are also barriers to breastfeeding. Timing \n\nNewborn babies should feed 8-12 times every 24 hours, typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks. A newborn has a very small stomach capacity. The amount of breast milk that is produced is timed to meet the infant's needs in that the first milk; colostrum is concentrated but produced in only very small amounts, gradually increasing in volume to meet the expanding size of the infant's stomach capacity. Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast, however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency. Duration and exclusivity\nNumerous health organizations, including, but not limited to, the CDC, WHO, National Health Service, Canadian Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth, unless medically contraindicated. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as \"an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals and medications.\" Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases, as discussed below. After solids are introduced at around six months of age, continued breastfeeding is recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months, or longer if both the mother and child wish. The World Health Organization's guidelines recommend \"continue[d] frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. In the United States, 22.4% of babies are breastfed for 12 months, the minimum amount of time advised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In India, mothers commonly breastfeed for 2 to 3 years. Supplementation \nSupplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant, in addition to breastmilk, during the first 6 months of life. Supplementation should only be used when medically indicated and when overseen by a medical professional, such as a pediatrician or family physician, and after consultation with a lactation counselor (CLC or IBCLC). Indications for use of donor breastmilk are very closely outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Due to low availability and high cost of donor breastmilk, the AAP recommends prioritizing the use of the milk for infants born with a weight of less than 1500g (approximately 3lb 5oz), as it is helpful in decreasing rates of the severe intestinal infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, in this population. The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows. Sometimes the let-down is so strong that the baby splutters and coughs and the mother may need to remove the baby from her breast for a short time until the flow becomes less forceful. Problems with Breastfeeding\n\nInverted nipples \n\nInfants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort. Ankyloglossia \n\nAnkyloglossia, also called \"tongue-tie\" may cause shallow latch, poor milk transfer, and other problems with breastfeeding. Additionally, the birth of an infant is followed by massive fluid shifts to both offload excess fluid, which had been used to supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetus through the placenta, which is no longer needed, and supply additional fluid to the breasts in order to start the process of making milk. Delay in milk \"coming in\" \n\nWhile milk normally \"comes in\" by 5 days after birth, there are several reasons this may be delayed. Mothers experiencing a delay in their milk coming in should consult with a lactation specialist and their pediatrician, as they may need to supplement with donor milk or formula to help the infant gain weight. Low milk supply \n\nBreast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. These reasons may include fussiness, colic, preference for the bottle as opposed to the breast, long nursing duration, decreased sensation of breast fulness, and even decreased frequency of infant stools. However, in these cases, it important to reassure the parent that infant gain is absolute proof of adequate milk intake. Thus, if the infant breastfeeding exclusively, and is gaining weight appropriately, then the parent can be reassured that they are producing enough milk. On the contrary, there are many causes of true low milk supply, and these causes can manifest prior to pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Poor milk intake is signaled by poor infant weight gain, signs of dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Poor milk intake can be caused by poor milk transfer by the infant or by true low milk supply by the mother. When the milk \"comes in\" appropriately, but is followed by decreased milk supply, this is most often caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. If the baby is latching and swallowing well (signs of good milk transfer), but is not gaining weight as expected or is showing signs of dehydration, low milk supply in the mother can be suspected, and a lactation specialist should be consulted. Newborn jaundice\n\nMore than 80% of newborns develop jaundice within several days of birth. By continuing to breastfeed frequently (start at 8-12 times per day), the infant's body can usually rid itself of the bilirubin excess by encouraging more urine and stool production. However, in some cases, the infant may need additional treatments, such as UV light therapy or additional feedings (see Supplementation) to keep the condition from progressing into more severe problems. There are two types of newborn jaundice related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and may occur in the first week of life in conjunction with ongoing weight loss. While there is some argument that decreased volume of intake in breastfed infants leads to decreased excretion of bilirubin through the stool (due to decreased number of stools), recent data actually seems to reject this notion, as it was found that there is no significant difference in stool production between formula-fed and breast fed infants. On the contrary, formula-fed infants tend to lose less weight after birth compared to breastfed infants, supporting the hypothesis that breastfeeding jaundice is related to caloric intake rather than volume intake. Breast milk jaundice is jaundice that persists despite appropriate weight gain. This type of jaundice may start as breastfeeding jaundice and persist, or may not appear until after the baby has begun to gain weight, typically around 4–5 days old. There is no single cause of breast milk jaundice; rather, the causes are multifactorial and frequently debated in the literature. Breast milk jaundice is usually not a reason to stop nursing. Weaning \n\nWeaning is the process of replacing breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually increase the period between feedings and/or eliminate feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. La Leche League advises parents to shift their children's focus at bedtime away from breastfeeding, as it is often the most difficult feeding for them to let go. If the mother was experiencing lactational amenorrhea her periods will begin to return as she begins to wean, along with the return of her fertility. Contraindications to Breastfeeding\n\nMaternal Contraindications \nMedical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are fairly rare. Infants that are otherwise healthy uniformly benefit from breastfeeding, however, extra precautions should be taken or breastfeeding  avoided in circumstances including certain infectious diseases and medical conditions. Factors such as the mother's viral load complicate breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers. The World Health Organization highlights the possibility of breastfeeding in mothers on anti-viral therapy and with undetectable viral loads, especially in areas where access to clean water is poor and where death from infectious diseases is common, citing low transmission rates when the mother is on anti-viral therapy. They also recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted by their maternal and child health services to best avoid HIV transmission from mother to child. However, the CDC continues to recommend against HIV-positive mothers breastfeeding in the United States. Infant formula should only be given if this can be safely done. The worldwide rate of transmission through breastmilk is estimated to be 3.9-27%, and this risk is increased by high maternal viral load and prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Current data demonstrates that while breastfeeding for less than six months does not, independently, increase risk of HTLV-1 transmission, not breastfeeding during that time does decrease risk of transmission. As such, CDC recommends against breastfeeding when mothers have HTLV Types I or II. Recognizing the importance of breastfeeding in more resource-poor areas of the world, the World Health Organization recommends shortening the duration of breastfeeding, or avoiding breastfeeding where possible. Hemorrhagic viral disease (Marburg virus, Ebola) \nMothers with Marburg virus or Ebola should not breastfeed their infants or feed them with expressed breastmilk. As such, these infants should not be breastfed during this time and until the mother has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. However, these infants may be fed expressed breastmilk from their mother. Transmission of TB through breastmilk, without an isolated breast infection caused by the Tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has never been documented in the scientific literature. Mothers who do have an isolated breast infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed tuberculous mastitis, should not feed their infants with their own breastmilk, even if it is fed by bottle. The CDC advises that breastfeeding is safe to continue as long as the breasts are clear of lesions, also emphasizing that if pumping or hand expressing milk, proper hand-hygiene should be used to minimize transfer. Substance Use \nTobacco: Mothers who smoke or use other tobacco products can breastfeed their infants, according to La Leche League, the CDC, and the Royal Women's Hospital (Australia) However, it is important to note that maternal tobacco use may decrease milk supply. Additionally, tobacco smoking, regardless of feeding method, increases risk of SIDS and respiratory illnesses. Many medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts, however, very few medications actually reach the infant and are absorbed in a way that would actually impact the infant. In addition to the effects on the infant, many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. Patients should be encouraged to consult a lactation specialist or a medical provider trained in breastfeeding medicine if any concerns arise. Pumping-and-dumping, or stopping breastfeeding altogether, is only required in very rare circumstances, such as with radioactive medications or chemotherapy. If a parent is concerned with a possible milk contaminant, they can express and save the breastmilk until they are able to consult with a lactation specialist or another medical professional trained in breastfeeding medicine. Mothers who have suspected or confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 should thoroughly wash their hands and wear a well-fitting mask prior to breastfeeding their infant, or express breastmilk and feed the infant by bottle. Infantile Contraindications\n\nGalactosemia \nGalactosemia is a metabolic disorder that prevents the infant from breaking down galactose, which is one of the two components of lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. Mothers express milk for multiple reasons. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Maternal breastmilk is the food of choice for premature babies; these infants may be fed maternal milk through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. While informally-shared breastmilk does carry the nutritional benefits of breastmilk, this breastmilk is most often not pasteurized or screened, and thus carries with it the risk of transmitting diseases or medications that are unsafe for infants. Parents considering directed or informal milk sharing should discuss this option with their doctor, and they should be familiar with the donors medical history and milk handling practices. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. While some infants do experience this preference for the bottle, many infants do not and will be able to alternate between bottle and breast without issue. However, from available evidence, it appears to be fairly uncommon, with only approximately 7% of study participants reporting exclusive pumping. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. While some children continue to breastfeed even with this change, others may wean. Most mothers can produce enough milk for tandem nursing, but the new baby should be nursed first for at least the first few days after delivery to ensure that it receives enough colostrum. Breastfeeding triplets or larger broods is a challenge given babies' varying appetites. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding. Re-lactation is most easily accomplished with a newborn or with a baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she is more likely to be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Techniques to promote lactation use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. A dropper or syringe without the needle may be used to place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. However, even when lactation is established, the supply may not be large enough to breastfeed exclusively. Parents and other family members should watch the baby's weight gain and urine output to assess nutritional adequacy. A WHO manual for physicians and senior health workers citing a 1992 source states:  \"If a baby has been breastfeeding sometimes, the breastmilk supply increases in a few days. If a baby has stopped breastfeeding, it may take 1-2 weeks or more before much breastmilk comes.\" Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that builds community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds. WHO states, \"Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.\" Baby \n\nEarly breastfeeding is associated with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, childhood lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, or childhood leukemia later in life. The CDC reports that infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of ear infections, obesity, type 1 diabetes, asthma, SIDS, and lower respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections. Comparing breastfed and non-breastfed siblings in a given family drastically decreases the association between breasfeeding and long-term child well-being. Growth \n\nThe average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby weighs about  times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula-fed babies, which improves long-run health. The Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition and Growth (DARLING) study reported that breastfed and formula-fed groups had similar weight gain during the first 3 months, but the breastfed babies began to drop below the median beginning at 6 to 8 months and were significantly lower weight than the formula-fed group between 6 and 18 months. Infections \n\nBreast milk contains several anti-infective factors such as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and lactoferrin (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria). Exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age helps to protect an infant from gastrointestinal infections in both developing and industrialized countries. The risk of death due to diarrhea and other infections increases when babies are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to die of gastrointestinal infections than infants who switched from exclusive to partial breastfeeding at three to four months. During breastfeeding, approximately 0.25–0.5 grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to the baby via milk. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. Mortality \n\nBabies who receive no breast milk are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than those who are partially or fully breastfed. A 2013 longitudinal study reported less obesity at ages two and four years among infants who were breastfed for at least four months. Allergic diseases \n\nIn children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist. Other health effects \n\nBreastfeeding may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). About 14 to 19 percent of leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for six months or longer. However, breastfeeding is also the primary cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as the HTLV-1 virus is transmitted through breastmilk. Breastfeeding is associated with a lower chance of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 in the offspring. Breastfed babies also appear to have a lower likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Breastfeeding may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life, as indicated by lower cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels in breastfed adult women. Breastfed infants have somewhat lower blood pressure later in life, but it is unclear how much practical benefit this provides. A 1998 study suggested that breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. Breastfeeding duration has been correlated with child maltreatment outcomes, including neglect and sexual abuse. However, other studies concluded that breastfeeding was associated with increased cognitive development in childhood, although the cause may be increased mother–child interaction rather than nutrition. Fertility \n\nExclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through lactational amenorrhea, although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. This has been used as natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed. When the newborn nurses  the mother secretes oxytocin which causes  the uterus to cramp and reduce blood loss. Nursing also causes the uterus to cramp for a number of days postpartum, helping it to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Weight retention\n\nIt is unclear whether breastfeeding causes mothers to lose weight after giving birth. Chronic conditions \nBreastfeeding is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among mothers who practice it. According to the American Heart Association, breastfeeding also reduces the risk of maternal heart disease and stroke. A 2011 review found it unclear whether breastfeeding affects the risk of postpartum depression. Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\n\nDysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is a condition in which breastfeeding women develop negative emotions that begin just before the milk letdown reflex and last less than a few minutes. Many hospitals have instituted practices that encourage breastfeeding, however a 2012 survey in the US found that 24% of maternity services were still providing supplements of commercial infant formula as a general practice in the first 48 hours after birth. This review contrasts with another large review that looked at education programs alone, which found no conclusive evidence of initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. An increase in these capacities of support has shown to greatly positively effect breastfeeding rates, especially among women with education below a high school level. Mother – Adolescence is a risk factor for low breastfeeding rates, although classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can help compensate. Breast surgery\nBreastfeeding can generally be attempted after breast augmentation or reduction surgery, however prior breast surgery is a risk factor for low milk supply. A 2014 review found that women who have breast implant surgery were less likely to exclusively breast feed, however it was based on only three small studies and the reasons for the correlation were not clear. Medications \n\nBreastfeeding mothers should inform their healthcare provider about all of the medications they are taking, including herbal products. Nursing mothers may be immunized and may take most over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs without risk to the baby but certain drugs, including some painkillers and some psychiatric drugs, may pose a risk. Some substances in the mother's food and drink are passed to the baby through breast milk, including mercury (found in some carnivorous fish), caffeine, and bisphenol A. Medical conditions \n\nUndiagnosed maternal celiac disease may cause a short duration of the breastfeeding period. Mothers with all types of diabetes mellitus normally use insulin to control their blood sugar, as the safety of other antidiabetic drugs while breastfeeding is unknown. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with some hormonal differences and obesity, may have greater difficulty with producing a sufficient supply to support exclusive breastfeeding, especially during the first weeks. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status \n\nThe rates of breastfeeding in the African-American community remain much lower than any other race, for a variety of proposed reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, higher rates of poor perinatal health, higher stress levels, less access to support, and less flexibility in the workplace. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class. Comparing facilities in primarily African American neighborhoods to ones in primarily White neighborhoods, the rates of practices that support or discourage breastfeeding were: limited use of supplements (13.1% compared with 25.8%) and rooming-in (27.7–39.4%)\n\nLow-income mothers are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The use of infant formula was thought to be a way for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding mothers may feel that they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. The authors advocate that women be provided with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills, however there is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding education alone improves initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. Prevalence \n\nGlobally about 38% of babies are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States the rate of women beginning to breastfeed was 76% in 2009 increasing to 83% in 2015 with 58% still breastfeeding at 6 months, although only 25% were still breastfeeding exclusively. African-American women have persistently low rates of breastfeeding compared to White and Hispanic American women. In 2014, 58.1% of African-American women breastfeed in the early postpartum period, compared to 77.7% of White women and 80.6% of Hispanic women. Breastfeeding rates in different parts of China vary considerably. Rates in the United Kingdom were the lowest in the world in 2015 with only 0.5% of mothers still breastfeeding at a year, while in Germany 23% are doing so, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. In Australia for children born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada for children born in 2005–06, more than 50% were only breastfed and more than 15% received both breastmilk and other liquids, by the age of 3 months. The appearance of improved infant formulas in the mid 19th century and its increased use caused a decrease in breastfeeding rates, which accelerated after World War II, and for some in the US, Canada, and UK, breastfeeding was seen as uncultured. Parents of breastfed babies are less likely to miss work and lose income because their babies are sick. Looking at three of the most common infant illnesses, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and gastrointestinal illness, one study compared infants that had been exclusively breastfed for at least three months to those who had not. It found that in the first year of life there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. In addition to this, there is also the moral question as to what degree the state or medical community can interfere with the self-determination of a woman: for example in the United Arab Emirates the law requires a woman to breastfeed her baby for at least 2 years and allows her husband to sue her if she does not do so. Preventing a situation where women are denied agency and/or stigmatized for formula use is also seen as important. In 2018, in the UK, a policy statement from the Royal College of Midwives said that women should be supported and not stigmatized, if  after being given advice and information, they choose to formula feed. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has reported that women who receive formula samples at discharge are associated with lower breastfeeding rates than those who did not receive gift bags. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative \n\nThe Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a program launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with UNICEF in order to promote infant feeding and maternal bonding through certified hospitals and birthing centers. BFHI was developed as a response to the influence held by formula companies in private and public maternal health care.The initiative has two core tenets: the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In the United States the CDC reports on a study that \"examined the effect of corporate lactation programs on breastfeeding behavior among employed women in California [which] included prenatal classes, perinatal counseling, and lactation management after the return to work\". They found that \"about 75% of mothers in the lactation programs continued breastfeeding at least 6 months, although nationally only 10% of mothers employed full-time who initiated breastfeeding were still breastfeeding at 6 months.\" Research \n\nBreastfeeding research continues to assess prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes.

Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction. ; 2) Community – When people find an individual or a group that shares the same values, likes, beliefs, etc., they find community. When this commitment happens, they tend to follow the same trends as a group and when one member introduces a new idea or product, it is accepted more readily based on the previous trust that has been established. In these cases, the innovators' behavior was largely dependent on public policy that accommodated knowledge sharing to foster cumulative innovation. The cost for information exchange has drastically decreased due, in a large part, \n\n Lim and Ong (2019) observed that in contrast to communities of practice, communities of innovation may emerge by themselves or be cultivated; they usually exist for a narrower purpose of producing a new service or product over a shorter life span; they are made up of participants from either one or more functions; they require a higher level of trust between participants to be effective; there is a higher cost to their participants; and the potential benefit to the organization may be greater when they are successfully implemented.

The main goal of contingency management is to promote positive behavior change and ultimately reduce illicit drug use. There are several concerns regarding contingency management that need to be addressed. However, it is important to note that contingency management focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are consistent with recovery and sobriety, rather than rewarding drug use itself. Another concern is whether the effects of contingency management can be maintained in the long term. However, implementing strategies for ongoing support and monitoring can help address this issue and increase the likelihood of sustained positive outcomes. It's important to consider that while most research on contingency management has been conducted in the United States, there have also been studies conducted in Europe and Australia which provide additional evidence for its effectiveness. By incorporating evidence-based practices from various studies conducted globally, contingency management can be effectively utilized as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing drug misuse and promoting positive behavior change. This was especially the case in substance abuse treatment settings (although some systems for smoking cessation continue to use the term token economy). For some time, systems derived from token economies were used under the name contingency management; initially this was more broadly defined and referred to any direct coupling of consequences (reinforcements or punishments) with behavior (for example staying clean ); later it referred specifically to one kind of token economy. The community reinforcement approach can be combined with contingency management; ‘tokens’ are used, whereas contingency management employs the term \"vouchers\" (or related terms). in 2003 found that people with ASPD who received contingency management (a positive approach involving rewards or incentives for desired behaviors) were more likely to abstain from cocaine use compared to participants without ASPD receiving contingency management or cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as participants with ASPD receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. By focusing on positive approaches such as contingency management, treatment providers can create an environment that encourages individuals with ASPD and drug misuse problems to make positive changes in their lives.

Astroviruses are a type of virus that was first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopes following an outbreak of diarrhea in humans. In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mamastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. In animals, Astroviruses also cause infection of the gastrointestinal tract but may also result in encephalitis (humans and cattle), hepatitis (avian) and nephritis (avian). There have been over 50 astroviruses reported, although the ICTV officially recognizes 22 species. The genus Avastrovirus comprises three species; Chicken astrovirus (Avian nephritis virus types 1–3), Duck astrovirus (Duck astrovirus C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (Turkey astrovirus 1). The genus Mamastrovirus includes Bovine astroviruses 1 and 2, Human astrovirus (types 1-8), Feline astrovirus 1, Porcine astrovirus 1, Mink astrovirus 1 and Ovine astrovirus 1. They are non-enveloped RNA viruses with cubic capsids, approximately 28–35 nm in diameter with T=3 symmetry. Human astroviruses are part of the Mammastrovirus genus and contains 8 serotypes. The human astrovirus capsid spikes have a distinct structure. The projection domain of the human astrovirus contains a receptor binding site for polysaccharides. The amino acid sequence of the astrovirus capsid protein does not have similar homology to other known viral proteins, but the closest would be hepatitis E virus. Life cycle\nAstroviruses infect birds and mammals through the fecal-oral route. Astrovirus RNA is infectious and functions as a messenger RNA for ORF1a and ORF1b. Genome\n\nAstroviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The capability for genetic recombination appears to be present in type-3 and type-4 human astroviruses, and in porcine astrovirus strains. Evolution\nThe Astroviridae capsid is related to those of the Tymoviridae. These symptoms are usually mild but in cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), which has dehydration, immune dysfunction and anorexia as symptoms, mortality is high. Mamastrovirus \nMamastroviruses often cause gastroenteritis in infected mammals. In animals, gastroenteritis is usually undiagnosed because most astrovirus infections are asymptomatic. However, in mink and humans, astroviruses can cause diarrhea and can be fatal. Human astroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised adults. 2–8% of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children is associated with human astrovirus. In sheep, ovine astroviruses were found in the villi of the small intestine. Mamastroviruses also cause diseases of the nervous system. Symptoms of this infection include seizure, lateral recumbency and impaired coordination. Signs and symptoms in humans\nMembers of a relatively new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised. Astrovirus infection is not usually a severe situation and only in some rare cases leads to dehydration. This could be due to climatic factors influencing the life cycle or transmission method for that particular strain of Astrovirus. Pathogenesis\nAstroviruses cause gastroenteritis by causing destruction of the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of secretory functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines. Inflammatory responses were seen to not affect astrovirus pathogenesis. Epidemiology\nAstroviruses are associated with 5–9% of the cases of gastroenteritis in young children. Humans of all ages are susceptible to astrovirus infection, but children, the elderly, and those that are immunocompromised are most prone. Studies in the USA have detected astroviruses in the stools of 2–9% of children presenting symptoms; illness is most frequent in children younger than two years, although outbreaks among adults and the elderly have been reported. The occurrence of astrovirus infections vary depending on the season. Human astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal–oral route.

In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mamastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. In animals, Astroviruses also cause infection of the gastrointestinal tract but may also result in encephalitis (humans and cattle), hepatitis (avian) and nephritis (avian). There have been over 50 astroviruses reported, although the ICTV officially recognizes 22 species. The genus Avastrovirus comprises three species; Chicken astrovirus (Avian nephritis virus types 1–3), Duck astrovirus (Duck astrovirus C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (Turkey astrovirus 1). The genus Mamastrovirus includes Bovine astroviruses 1 and 2, Human astrovirus (types 1-8), Feline astrovirus 1, Porcine astrovirus 1, Mink astrovirus 1 and Ovine astrovirus 1. They are non-enveloped RNA viruses with cubic capsids, approximately 28–35 nm in diameter with T=3 symmetry. Human astroviruses are part of the Mammastrovirus genus and contains 8 serotypes. The human astrovirus capsid spikes have a distinct structure. The projection domain of the human astrovirus contains a receptor binding site for polysaccharides. The amino acid sequence of the astrovirus capsid protein does not have similar homology to other known viral proteins, but the closest would be hepatitis E virus. Life cycle\nAstroviruses infect birds and mammals through the fecal-oral route. Astrovirus RNA is infectious and functions as a messenger RNA for ORF1a and ORF1b. Genome\n\nAstroviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The capability for genetic recombination appears to be present in type-3 and type-4 human astroviruses, and in porcine astrovirus strains. Evolution\nThe Astroviridae capsid is related to those of the Tymoviridae. These symptoms are usually mild but in cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), which has dehydration, immune dysfunction and anorexia as symptoms, mortality is high. Mamastrovirus \nMamastroviruses often cause gastroenteritis in infected mammals. In animals, gastroenteritis is usually undiagnosed because most astrovirus infections are asymptomatic. However, in mink and humans, astroviruses can cause diarrhea and can be fatal. Human astroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised adults. 2–8% of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children is associated with human astrovirus. In sheep, ovine astroviruses were found in the villi of the small intestine. Mamastroviruses also cause diseases of the nervous system. Symptoms of this infection include seizure, lateral recumbency and impaired coordination. Signs and symptoms in humans\nMembers of a relatively new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised. Astrovirus infection is not usually a severe situation and only in some rare cases leads to dehydration. This could be due to climatic factors influencing the life cycle or transmission method for that particular strain of Astrovirus. Pathogenesis\nAstroviruses cause gastroenteritis by causing destruction of the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of secretory functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines. Inflammatory responses were seen to not affect astrovirus pathogenesis. Epidemiology\nAstroviruses are associated with 5–9% of the cases of gastroenteritis in young children. Humans of all ages are susceptible to astrovirus infection, but children, the elderly, and those that are immunocompromised are most prone. Studies in the USA have detected astroviruses in the stools of 2–9% of children presenting symptoms; illness is most frequent in children younger than two years, although outbreaks among adults and the elderly have been reported. The occurrence of astrovirus infections vary depending on the season. Human astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal–oral route.

At the prenatal and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. They play a vital role in adaptive immunity, which involves the recognition and targeting of specific pathogens. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are proteins produced by B lymphocytes in response to foreign substances, such as pathogens or antigens. Antibodies recognize specific antigens and bind to them, marking them for destruction or neutralization by other components of the immune system. Different types of antibodies have distinct characteristics and functions. Memory cells are more numerous than the naïve cells present before encountering the antigen and can rapidly respond when reexposed to the same antigen. This memory response is why vaccination aims to stimulate the production of memory cells. They coordinate immune responses and eliminate infected or abnormal cells. Antibodies, produced by B lymphocytes, recognize and target antigens for destruction or neutralization. It is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. When a foreign substance, also known as an antigen, enters the body, specialized cells of the immune system called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognize and capture the antigen. These APCs then present the antigen to other immune cells, specifically T cells and B cells, which are responsible for the adaptive immune response. Once the antigens are recognized, these immune cells activate and initiate an immune response tailored to that particular foreign substance. These immune complexes help in neutralizing the foreign substances and targeting them for elimination by other immune cells, such as macrophages. The immune system also has a remarkable ability to remember previous encounters with antigens. This is known as immunological memory. When the body is exposed to the same antigen again, memory T cells and B cells rapidly respond, leading to a quicker and more effective immune response. This memory response is the basis for the effectiveness of vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to create an immunological memory without causing the disease. In summary, the immune system recognizes foreign substances through specialized cells, mounts an immune response tailored to that particular substance, and neutralizes them through the production of antibodies, immune complexes, and the activation of other immune cells. Its ability to remember previous encounters allows for a faster and more efficient response upon re-exposure to the same antigen. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

This can help shrink EHE tumors and improve symptoms, including pain •Tyrosine kinase inhibitors: These drugs, designed as targeted therapies for cancers, have shown short-term success with EHE. Examples include sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib. •Multi-agent chemotherapy: EHE tumors that grow rapidly, spread to other tissues or do not respond to other medications may require more aggressive drug therapy. •Others like surgery can be done as treatment for the virus during its most severe. 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapy agent, has been shown to significantly reduce the levels of BDNF in the hippocampus of the rat. This evidence suggests that chemotherapy agent toxicity to cells in the hippocampus may be partially responsible for the memory declines experienced by some patients. There are currently seven drugs approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, including injectable interferon (IFN) α, pegylated interferon (PEG IFN), and various oral agents such as lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. While clinical trials often focus on short-term outcomes achieved over 1-2 years, these gains have long-term implications in reducing the risk of clinical progression, hepatic decompensation, and death. The goal is to prevent the further deterioration of liver function and the development of serious complications associated with chronic hepatitis B. Although standard IFN is no longer used to treat hepatitis B, it played a significant role historically and provided important insights into antiviral therapy in general.

On Friday, 8 August 2014, following the occurrence of Ebola in the United States and Europe and with the already intense transmission ongoing in three other countries for months, the WHO declared its third PHEIC in response to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa. Later, one review showed that a direct impact of this epidemic on America escalated a PHEIC declaration. It was the first PHEIC in a resource-poor setting. spread to Guinea, Liberia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Italy, the United States, and more. They funded $20,000 to a radio station in Sierra Leone to keep the people informed about the virus and the precautions that they could take in order to avoid it. In contrast, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic lasted more than two years, had nearly 29,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak. They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it.

These viruses are passed through sexual contact; through transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products; through sharing of contaminated needles and syringes among injection drug users; intrapartum or perinatally from mother to infant; or via breast milk. There is a definite, though small, occupational risk of infection for health care workers and laboratory personnel who work with HIV-infected specimens. #### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**\n\nAs of January 1, 2010, an estimated 1,108,611 cumulative cases of AIDS had been diagnosed in the United States; there have been approximately 600,000 deaths due to AIDS.As of January 1, 2010, an estimated 1.1 million HIV-infected persons were living in the United States; approximately 21% of these individuals are unaware that they are infected.An estimated 56,000 individuals are newly infected each year in the United States; this figure has remained stable for at least 15 years (Fig.189-12, p. 1518, in HPIM-18).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Syndromic Surveillance: Syndromic surveillance systems monitor the signs and symptoms of diseases instead of waiting for laboratory confirmation. This can include monitoring emergency department visits, over-the-counter medication sales, or school absenteeism rates to detect outbreaks or public health emergencies. Survey-Based Surveillance: Public health departments may conduct surveys to gather information on various health issues. Environmental Monitoring: Public health departments also monitor environmental factors that impact health, such as air and water quality, food safety, and workplace hazards. This surveillance helps identify and address potential health risks in the community. These surveillance systems, among others, assist public health departments in collecting timely and accurate data to inform decision-making and interventions aimed at protecting and promoting the health of the population. Real-time outbreak and disease surveillance system (RODS) is a syndromic surveillance system developed by the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biomedical Informatics. It is \"prototype developed at the University of Pittsburgh where real-time clinical data from emergency departments within a geographic region can be integrated to provide an instantaneous picture of symptom patterns and early detection of epidemic events.\" The current data collection and surveillance methods are through the national Health Management Information System (HMIS). However there is very low usage of this system as paper-based records are lost in delivery, poor quality of data(inaccurate statistical data), untimely delivery of HMIS reports, exclusion of data from the private health providers and at the community level, inadequate segregation of HMIS data and limited political support. Use of surveillance data for research is being improved through Web-based access to the data and analytic tools, and linking with other national data sources. Public health surveillance (also epidemiological surveillance, clinical surveillance or syndromic surveillance) is, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"the continuous, systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data needed for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice.\" Public health surveillance may be used to track emerging health-related issues at an early stage and find active solutions in a timely manner. Surveillance systems are generally called upon to provide information regarding when and where health problems are occurring and who is affected. Public health surveillance systems can be passive or active. Passive surveillance systems are less time-consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination. Techniques of public health surveillance have been used in particular to study infectious diseases. Many large institutions, such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have created databases and modern computer systems (public health informatics) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as influenza, SARS, HIV, and even bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States. Syndromic surveillance\n\nSyndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate disease outbreaks. According to a CDC definition, \"the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with bioterrorism is increasingly being explored by public health officials.\" The first indications of disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a physician or a lab. Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns. When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease epidemiologists and public health professionals are alerted that there may be an issue. An early awareness and response to a bioterrorist attack could save many lives and potentially stop or slow the spread of the outbreak. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process. A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by Gunther Eysenbach, who began work on such a system in 2004. More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modeling from Google search queries have been proposed. Digital methods\nDigital surveillance of public health largely relies on three methods: search-based trends on sites like Google and Wikipedia, social media posts on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and participatory surveillance websites such as Flu Near You and Influenzanet. Search trends provide indirect data on public health, while the latter two methods provide direct data. Wikipedia has also been used, though it is potentially prone to \"noise\", as it is a popular source of health information whether a user is ill or not. This methodology has also been used by Public Health England in the United Kingdom as one of their syndromic surveillance endpoints. It is the most used social media platform for public health surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance\nSome conditions, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Since many laboratory results, at least in Europe and the US, are automatically processed by computerized laboratory information systems, the results are relatively easy to inexpensively collate in special purpose databases or disease registries. Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level. Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. Laboratory surveillance differs from population-wide surveillance because it can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. Therefore, it is more suitable for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.

The eradication of all poliomyelitis will require successful cessation of all oral polio vaccine use and containment of all sources of poliovirus, including circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses. A baby is given a dose of oral polio vaccine in a clinic in the Jah Tondo camp for internally displaced persons, near Monrovia, Liberia. Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the nervous system. Polio is incurable but it can be easily prevented through immunization. The first utilizes a live attenuated (weakened) poliovirus and is administered through oral drops. In countries where the wild poliovirus is still in circulation, this oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used because administering OPV requires minimal training and equipment. The second type of vaccine is an inactivated (killed) polio vaccine that is injected (IPV). The inactivated polio vaccine is used primarily in countries where the wild poliovirus has already been eliminated. However, poor health and malnutrition can slow the rate at which a childâ€™s immune system â€œconvertsâ€� the polio vaccine. It is not harmful to receive multiple doses of polio vaccine during immunization rounds. It is critical to immunize every child, every round; in fact, the more doses a child receives, the more protected he or she is against polio. Monovalent oral polio vaccines (mOPV) for the three types of polioviruses were used extensively in the early days of polio vaccination in the late 1950s and early 1960s, providing extensive experience of these vaccines. With tOPV, protection against all three types of wild poliovirus could be given at the same time, a very important consideration when more than one type of wild poliovirus was circulating. It is highly infectious and caused by three types of wild polio viruses: type 1, type 2, and type 3. It's important to note that not all individuals infected with the polio virus will experience symptoms. To prevent polio, immunization is crucial. Polio vaccines are available in two forms: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV). It helps protect against infection caused by wild (naturally occurring) polio viruses. On the other hand, IPV is an injectable vaccine that contains inactivated (killed) polio viruses and provides immunity against all three types of polio virus. Vaccination is the most effective and reliable method to prevent polio. It not only protects individuals from acquiring the infection but also helps in preventing the transmission of the polio virus within communities. In many parts of the world, widespread vaccination campaigns have successfully eliminated polio transmission. However, it is important to continue immunization efforts to maintain this progress and prevent polio resurgence. It is worth noting that there have been concerns about the contamination of a specific batch of oral polio vaccine in some regions. However, overall, polio vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing polio. Vaccination remains the best preventive measure against polio and continues to be recommended by health authorities worldwide. The eradication program therefore gave drops over and over again, to boost children's immunity higher and as a precaution against missed children. Few parents initially knew that the vaccination \n\n The only human vaccine to have caused any significant number of infections is the oral polio vaccine (OPV), and this vaccine is no longer used in developed countries. However, the OPV is still used in Asia and Africa, leading to a small number of vaccine-induced polio infections each year. In 2016, the formulation of the OPV was changed to remove the already extinct and most problematic type 2 polio strain from the OPV. The attenuated virus from vaccines is much weaker and less likely to infect than the wild virus.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Informed consent and trust are also critical considerations. Secondary data use is another ethical issue. Sustainability and implementation validity are important ethical considerations as well. By considering privacy, informed consent and trust, confidentiality and security, secondary data use, sustainability and implementation validity, risk-benefit ratio, governance and conflict of interest, justice, equity, access, and collaborative partnerships, countries and implementers can make informed decisions and create ethical frameworks to guide the implementation of NHDWHs within LMICs. Increasingly, medical ethics deems such actions to be medical paternalism, and they are discouraged in modern medicine. A hypothetical example demonstrates the increased engagement of a patient operating in a Health 2.0 setting: a patient goes to see their primary care physician with a presenting complaint, having first ensured their own medical record was up to date via the Internet. The treating physician might make a diagnosis or send for tests, the results of \n\n a pregnancy in an underage patient, without the knowledge of the patient's parents. Traditionally, medical ethics has viewed the duty of confidentiality as a relatively non-negotiable tenet of medical practice. Confidentiality is an important issue in primary care ethics, where physicians care for many patients from the same family and community, and where third parties often request information from the considerable medical database typically gathered in primary health care. Whereas bioethics tends to deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature of the human body and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics has its roots in the writings of Hippocrates, and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by Plato and Aristotle. As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds \"the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these outcome measures are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies.\" Terms like beneficence and non-maleficence are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics. Medical ethics is an applied branch of ethics which analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal. It is important to note that these four values are not ranked in order of importance or relevance and that they all encompass values pertaining to medical ethics. However, a conflict may arise leading to the need for hierarchy in an ethical system, such that some moral elements overrule others with the purpose of applying\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

People who have chronic hepatitis B infection are recommended to see their doctor or specialist regularly for a check-up. If you have chronic hepatitis B, you may have to take medicines for the rest of your life. If you have hepatitis B and are pregnant, there are treatments available which are effective in preventing your baby from getting hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that affects the liver and can lead to serious illness or death. Routine immunisation protects your child from hepatitis B, but see a GP if your child has symptoms like jaundice. Hepatitis B causes inflammation of the liver and eventually liver failure. Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus and occurs worldwide. Hepatitis B vaccines are available and require a series of three doses over six months. Infected hepatitis B virus infants are more likely to develop complications such as chronic infection, cirrhosis or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Both vaccines are well tolerated. It is unknown whether hepatitis B vaccine protects health-care workers from infection of mutated hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus. Around 350 million people worldwide are chronic infected carriers of the virus. Chronic hepatitis B is a very common infectious disease leading to chronic liver disease, affecting around 350 million people all over the world. In her PhD dissertation at Harvard, Emily Oster argued that Sen's hypothesis did not take account of the different rates of prevalence of the Hepatitis B virus between Asia and other parts of the world. Regions with higher rates of Hepatitis B infection tend to have higher ratios of male to female births for biological reasons which are not yet well understood, but which have been extensively documented. The Hepatitis B Foundation's research arm, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, has the largest number of non-profit scientists dedicated to hepatitis B research in the world. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Human immunodeficiency virus infection are classical examples of blood-borne diseases. Unlike hepatitis A, which is spread by the fecal-oral route and is indicative of a breakdown in food safety or potable water protection, hepatitis B, C and HIV are spread by contact with bodily fluids, most frequently blood, although in the case of HIV, not exclusively so. Also, unlike hepatitis A in which the sufferer almost always recovers completely, or rarely dies, both hepatitis B and C often give rise to chronic carrier states \n\n In some parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, HCC is the most common cancer, generally affecting men more than women, and with an age of onset between the late teens and 30s. This variability is in part due to the different patterns of hepatitis B and hepatitis C transmission in different populations – infection at or around birth predispose to earlier cancers than if people are infected later. The time between hepatitis B infection and development into HCC can be years, even decades, but from diagnosis of HCC to death, the average survival period is only 5.9 months according to one Chinese study during the 1970-80s, or 3 months (median survival time) in sub-Saharan Africa according to Manson's textbook of tropical diseases. HCC is one of the deadliest cancers in China, where chronic hepatitis B is found in 90% of cases. In Japan, chronic hepatitis C is associated with 90% of HCC cases.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
