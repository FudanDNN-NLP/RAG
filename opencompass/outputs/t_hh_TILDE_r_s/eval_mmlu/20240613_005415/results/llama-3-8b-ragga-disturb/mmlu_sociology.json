The second group of mass society theorists, those who emphasized social disintegration and the quality of participation, was best represented by Emil Lederer, Erich Fromm, and Sigmund Neumann.

Focuses on these factors include studies on rural-urban migration, kinship in the city, problems that arise from urbanism, and social stratification. After the industrial revolution, works such as Georg Simmel's The Metropolis and Mental Life (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The Chicago School produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists. Landscape Urbanism is a theory that first surfaced in the 1990s, arguing that the city is constructed of interconnected and ecologically rich horizontal field conditions, rather than the arrangement of objects and buildings. Landscape urbanism theorises sites, territories, ecosystems, networks, and infrastructures through landscape practice according to Corner, while applying a dynamic concept to cities as ecosystems that grow, shrink or change phases of \n\n in which urban resistance is a key image; the gendered city, dominant in urbanizing areas such as Africa where women find themselves newly employed in low-wage labor; postmodern city, that is centered on capitalism; and fortress city, where different populations within the city are separated, usually based on socioeconomic factors. Another important and commonly studied aspect of the urban society is poverty, which is believed to be a problem that arises out of urbanism. Urban anthropologists study several aspects individually, and attempt to tie different aspects together, such as the relationship between poverty and social stratification.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

According to Monitoring the Future, between 2010–2012 and 2014–2016, marijuana usage by eighth and 10th graders increased by 2.0% and 4.1% respectively. Additionally, though research has been conducted, it is recognized that there is not enough substantial empirical research to conclude that the use of cannabis leads to amotivational syndrome. Anecdotal information such as statements taken from cannabis users includes feeling listless and lethargic. Amotivational syndrome still ranks high among the key problems associated with the drug, with researchers having adopted the phrase “amotivational” to describe lethargic cannabis users. Low socioeconomic status (SES), as indicated by school type and employment status, was consistently associated with higher rates of cigarette smoking among both males and females. Coleman admitted to using marijuana as a youth, and he advocated its legalization while in college. He has said that maturity led him to understand that his drug use was dangerous and has repeatedly stated his opposition to legalized drugs, including marijuana. He has said, \"I oppose the legalization of marijuana because, as noted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, marijuana can have serious adverse health effects on individuals. The health problems that may occur from this highly addictive drug include short-term memory loss, anxiety, respiratory illness and a risk of lung cancer that far exceeds that of tobacco products. John Gregory Bourke described the use of \"mariguan\", which he identifies as Cannabis indica or Indian hemp, by Mexican residents of the Rio Grande region of Texas in 1894. Bourke wrote that because it was often used in a mixture with toloachi (which he inaccurately describes as Datura stramonium), mariguan was one of the several plants known as \"loco weed\". Bourke compared mariguan to hasheesh, which he called \"one of the greatest curses of the East\", citing reports that users \"become maniacs and are apt to commit all sorts of acts of violence and murder\", causing degeneration of the body and an idiotic appearance, and mentioned laws against sale of hasheesh \"in most Eastern countries\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be \"real work,\" and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability. Working-class Americans \n\n Though most Americans today identify themselves as middle class, American society and its culture are considerably more fragmented. Social class, generally described as a combination of educational attainment, income and occupational prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America. Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes. Upper-middle-class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values. The consensus has been that the workers had their own political and cultural value system. Previously it had been common for girls to be educated by a private tutor, an approach which led to young women growing up with a feeling of isolation from their peers. The emerging middle classes also could not afford private tuition for their daughters, and while anxious not to send them to poor schools, took advantage of the growing number of private schools for girls, of which there were at least one in most English cities by 1878.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Common examples of electronic monitoring of individuals under pre-trial or immigrant detention, house arrest, on probation or parole include: GPS wrist and ankle monitors, cellphones with biometric security systems, ignition interlock devices and automated probation check-in centers or kiosks. The use of electronic monitoring has increased considerably in recent years in the United States.

Gemeinschaft relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society. Max Weber (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people. Geert Hofstede (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals. Fellow German sociologist, Ferdinand Tönnies, theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on \"gemeinschaft and gesellschaft\". Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (\"pure sociology\"), whereas the second empirically and inductively (\"applied sociology\"). \"[Sociology is] ... the \n\n Rationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed – by contrast with anthropology – on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German antipositivist Max Weber, though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of dialectism and sociocultural evolution informs the concept. Weber demonstrated rationalization in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which the aims of certain Protestant Theologies, particularly Calvinism, are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. Firstly, society is organized in a systematic way, with individuals coming together to form groups and communities. Examples of institutions include government, education, healthcare, and the economy. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: gemeinschaft (usually translated as \"community\") and gesellschaft (\"society\" or \"association\"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a \"unity of will\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

One factor contributing to the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was the cutbacks in income transfers during the Reagan years. These cutbacks helped increase both poverty and inequality. However, changes in tax policy did have some impact on reducing poverty and increasing inequality. It's important to note that the lack of progress against poverty and the rise in inequality was not solely due to policy choices during the Reagan Administration. There were broader social and economic factors at play, such as widening income differences and challenges faced by families in staying out of poverty. Overall, while the standard of living improved to some extent during the Reagan years, there were persistent issues of income inequality and poverty that were not adequately addressed by the policy measures undertaken. Economists Goldin and Katz estimate that the increase in economic returns to education was responsible for about 60% of the increase in wage inequality between 1973 and 2005. Nor does the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for more skilled workers seem to be generally associated with a divergence in household income among the population. Inventions of the 20th century such as AC electric power, the automobile, airplane, radio, television, the washing machine, Xerox machine, each had an economic impact similar to computers, microprocessors and internet, but did not coincide with greater inequality. Another explanation is that the combination of the introduction of technologies that increase the demand for skilled workers, and the failure of the American education system to provide a sufficient \n\nThere are several factors that have contributed to the increase in Americans applying for and receiving disability income in recent years. Additionally, the 1996 welfare reform bill, which required states to reduce welfare numbers, may have provided an incentive for states to reclassify poor individuals as disabled to improve their welfare statistics. It is important to note that poverty and lack of education are also important determinants of who seeks disability, independent of illness status. Individuals with lower levels of education and those living in poverty are more likely to apply for and receive disability income. Causes of income inequality in the United States describes the reasons for the unequal distribution of income in the US and the factors that cause it to change over time. Income inequality in the United States grew significantly beginning in the early 1970s,  after several decades of stability. The US consistently exhibits higher rates of income inequality than most developed nations, arguably due to the nation's relatively less regulated markets.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

In the early 1960s the use of LSD and other psychedelics was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler, and, according to Laurence Veysey, they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth. From 1964 the Merry Pranksters, a \n\nPsychopharmacology is the study of the effects of any psychoactive drug that acts upon the mind by affecting brain chemistry. With the dawn of the Neolithic, drugs which require a longer time for production followed, mainly narcotic drugs such as alcohol and opium, but also cannabis. However, the use of psychiatric drugs to restore mental health, or at least limit aberrant behaviour, has only been widespread since the 1950s when a number of new classes of drugs were discovered, notably tranquillizers and antidepressants. Following their discovery some of these drugs gained popularity among psychiatrists and general practitioners. Outside of the more popular drugs there was success in the treatment of some of the symptoms of psychosis and depression. It went beyond simple sedation, with patients showing improvements in thinking and emotional behaviour, and over 100 million patients were treated. Such drugs had a revolutionary role in transforming mental institutions from an almost purely custodial role. But the limited knowledge of brain chemistry means that even more modern compounds cause a range of extrapyramidal side-effects and while effective at controlling acute symptoms are of less value in treating chronic symptoms. Enthusiasm for the first generation of anti-psychotic medications peaked in the late 1960s, but the image of the drugs plummeted in the mid-1970s, as studies emerged showing high rates of tardive dyskinesia, a typically permanent neurological disorder involving involuntary movements, in chronic users. LSD was promoted in the 1950s as a psychiatric cure-all, useful for treating schizophrenia, criminal behavior, sexual deviancy, alcoholism, and a wide variety of other mental ailments. Drug manufacturer Sandoz Laboratories suggested in its literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves, to gain a better subjective understanding of the schizophrenic experience. Many users have reported profound, life-transforming experiences as a result of taking LSD, while others have experienced intensely negative \"bad trips\", and a few have devolved into states of LSD psychosis. While scientific research into the effects and potential uses of LSD was common in the 1950s, it gradually declined as LSD became increasingly associated with spiritual experiences, recreational use, and hippies in the 1960s. Several researchers, most prominently erstwhile Harvard professor Dr. Timothy Leary, dissociated themselves from the mainstream mental health research establishment as its support for LSD research declined and transitioned to roles as spiritual gurus, advocating the use of LSD for personal spiritual growth. Potential theraputic uses of MDMA have been overshadowed by its popularity as a recreational drug and negative public perceptions fostered by anti-drug groups. The United States DEA's scheduling of MDMA as a Schedule 1 drug with no legitimate medical uses (some experts have recommended it be listed instead on Schedule 3, for drugs with potential medical applications) has severely hampered research. Improvements were made but the results were less marked than with anti-psychotic drugs. In particular, the hallucinogen LSD, which at the time was still legal in the United States, was very popular, and in 1966 Anger released a version of his earlier film, Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome titled the \"Sacred Mushroom Edition\" which was screened to people while taking LSD, thereby heightening their sensory experience. The linking of the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by The Manson Family to Beatles songs such as \"Helter Skelter\" contributed to an anti-hippie backlash.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

With this profession a formal interest developed in labor relations, motivation of a work force, and efficiency in production. Frederick Winslow Taylor developed the scientific theory of management which he published in the journal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1895. In management literature today, the term \"scientific management\" mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples (\"classical\", implying \"no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value\") in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. Henry Mintzberg, Peter Drucker and Donella Meadows were three very notable theorists addressing these concerns in the 1980s. Mintzberg and Drucker studied how executives spent their time, Meadows how change and leverage to resist it existed at all levels in all kinds of organizations. Adhocracy, functional leadership models and reengineering were all attempts to detect and remove administrative incompetence. Business process and quality management methods in general remove managerial flexibility that is often perceived as masking managerial mistakes, but also preventing transparency and facilitating fraud, as in the case of Enron. Had managers been more accountable to employees, it is argued, owners and employees would not have been defrauded. The techniques addressed are drawn in the main from managerial accounting and corporate finance: the former allow management to better understand, and hence act on, financial information relating to profitability and performance; the latter, as above, are about optimizing the overall financial structure, including its impact on working capital. Academics working in this area are typically based in business school finance departments, in accounting, or in management science.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Marxist feminism states that private property, which gives rise to economic inequality as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression. According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations—that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production.

But he is now largely concerned with understanding the political culture of Britain as well as the United States and in working in a more overtly post-disciplinary manner. Various political ideologies, such as Christian democracy and certain forms of social and classical liberalism, can be classified as centrist ones, as can the Third Way, a modern political movement that attempts to reconcile right-wing and left-wing politics by advocating for a synthesis of centre-right economic platforms with some centre-left social policies. Unger sees this alternative as applicable across a broad range of richer and poorer societies, thus making possible a \"universalizing heresy\" that can oppose the universalizing orthodoxy promulgated by the rich Western countries on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

This alternative would reshape production and politics, would refuse to see familiar forms of market economy, representative democracy and free civil society as necessary or canonical, would reject the contrast between market-oriented and command-economy solutions as a focus of ideological contests, would focus more on equality and inclusion within a setting of economic growth and technological innovation, than on increasing equality by redistribution through tax-and-transfer.

Reasons cited for this controversy include the subjectivity of diagnosis, the use of diagnosis and treatment for social and political control including detaining citizens and treating them without consent, and the side effects of treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotics and historical procedures like lobotomy and other forms of psychosurgery or insulin shock therapy. There are a number of groups who are either critical towards psychiatry or entirely hostile to the field. The Critical Psychiatry Network is a group of psychiatrists who are critical of psychiatry; there are self-described psychiatric survivor groups such MindFreedom International, religious groups like Scientologists. Background \n\nSince the 1960s there have been challenges to the concept of mental illness. Sociologists Erving Goffman and Thomas Scheff said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; behavioural psychologists challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; gay rights activists criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. Since the social enlightenment about homosexuality, it is no longer considered a mental illness and is more widely accepted by society. For many years, some psychiatrists (such as David Rosenhan, Peter Breggin, Paula Caplan, Thomas Szasz) and outside critics (such as Stuart A. Kirk) have \"been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality\". In 2013, Allen Frances said that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". The term medicalization entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of Irving Zola, Peter Conrad and Thomas Szasz, among others. These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's \"The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance\", published in 1973 (hyperkinesis was the term then used to describe what we might now call ADHD). These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz, 1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of \"psychotechnology\" (Chorover, 1973). Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through iatrogenesis, a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the clinical, involving serious side effects worse than the original condition; the social, whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the structural, whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively \"medicalized\" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these natural processes. Marxists such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive capitalist society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as social inequality and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials. Examples of political abuse of the power, entrusted in physicians and particularly psychiatrists, are abundant in history and seen during the Nazi era and the Soviet rule when political dissenters were labeled as \"mentally ill\" and subjected to inhumane \"treatments.\" In the period from the 1960s up to 1986, abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to be systematic in the Soviet Union, and occasional in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Political abuse of psychiatry also takes place in the People's Republic of China and in Russia. Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of 'sluggish schizophrenia' in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. Nature of diagnosis\n\nArbitrariness \nPsychiatry has been criticized for its broad range of mental diseases and disorders. Which diagnoses exist are considered valid have changed over time depending on society's norms. Historic disorders that are no longer recognised include orthorexia nervosa, sexual addiction, parental alienation syndrome, pathological demand avoidance, Internet addiction disorder. Thomas Szasz argued that mental health diagnoses were used as a form of labelling violations of societies norms. Bill Fullford, introduced the idea of \"value-laden\" mental health diagnosis with mental health lying between physical health and a moral judgment. Under this system personality disorders are seen as not very factual and very value-laden while delirium is quite factual and not very value-laden. Biological basis \nIn 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that he believes that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". Mary Boyle argues  that psychiatry is actually the study of behaviour, but acts as if it is the study of the brain based on a presumed connection between patterns of behaviour and the biological function of the brain. She argues that the concept of schizophrenia and its biological basis serves a social function for psychiatrists. She views the concept of schizophrenia is necessary for psychiatry to be considered as a medical field, that the claimed biological link gives psychiatrists protection from accusations of social control. And that the belief in the biological basis for schizophrenia is maintained through secondary source's misrepresentation of underlying data. Nancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. Treatment\n\nPsychosurgery \n\nPsychosurgery is brain surgery with the aim of changing an individuals behaviour or psychological function. Other forms of ablative psychosurgery were in use in the UK in the late 1970s, to treat psychotic and mood disorders. Bilateral cingulotomy was used to treat substance abuse disorder in Russia until 2002. Psychosurgery was criticized in the US in the late 1960s and 1970s by psychiatrist Peter Breggin. He identified all psychosurgery with the lobotomy as a rhetorical device. Psychosurgeons William Beecher Scoville and Petter Lindström said that Breggin's critique was emotional and not based on facts. Psychosurgery was investigated by the US Senate in the 1973 by the Health Subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy due to growing concern about the ethical boundaries of science and medicine. At this committee Breggin argued that newer forms of psychosurgery were the same as the lobotomy since it had the same effects \"emotional blunting, passivity, reduced capacity to learn\" and said that psychosurgeons \"represent the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values\", arguing that if the US became a totalitarian regime lobotomy and psychosurgery would be the equivalent of the secret police. Electroconvulsive therapy \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a therapy method which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is, in a modified form, still in use today, and was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated. Marketing of antipsychotic drugs \nPsychiatry has greatly benefitted by advances in pharmacotherapy. In the past, it was rare, but nowadays child psychiatrists on a regular basis prescribe psychotropic substances for children, for instance Ritalin. Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. Anti-psychiatry \n\nThe term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and is understood in current psychiatry to mean opposition to psychiatry's perceived role aspects of treatment. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are \"ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients“. Psychiatry is seen to involve an \"unequal power relationship between doctor and patient“, and advocates of anti-psychiatry claim a subjective diagnostic process, leaving much room for opinions and interpretations. Three authors have come to personify the movement against psychiatry, of which two are or have been practicing psychiatrists. Michael Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term \"anti-psychiatry\" itself was coined by David Cooper in 1967. Divergence within psychiatry generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and is still present. Issues remaining relevant in contemporary psychiatry are questions of; freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.

In 2013, Allen Frances said that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". The term medicalization entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of Irving Zola, Peter Conrad and Thomas Szasz, among others. These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's \"The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance\", published in 1973 (hyperkinesis was the term then used to describe what we might now call ADHD). These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz, 1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of \"psychotechnology\" (Chorover, 1973). Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through iatrogenesis, a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the clinical, involving serious side effects worse than the original condition; the social, whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the structural, whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively \"medicalized\" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these natural processes. Marxists such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive capitalist society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as social inequality and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials. Examples of political abuse of the power, entrusted in physicians and particularly psychiatrists, are abundant in history and seen during the Nazi era and the Soviet rule when political dissenters were labeled as \"mentally ill\" and subjected to inhumane \"treatments.\" In the period from the 1960s up to 1986, abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to be systematic in the Soviet Union, and occasional in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Political abuse of psychiatry also takes place in the People's Republic of China and in Russia. Psychiatric diagnoses such as the diagnosis of 'sluggish schizophrenia' in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. Nature of diagnosis\n\nArbitrariness \nPsychiatry has been criticized for its broad range of mental diseases and disorders. Which diagnoses exist are considered valid have changed over time depending on society's norms. Historic disorders that are no longer recognised include orthorexia nervosa, sexual addiction, parental alienation syndrome, pathological demand avoidance, Internet addiction disorder. Thomas Szasz argued that mental health diagnoses were used as a form of labelling violations of societies norms. Bill Fullford, introduced the idea of \"value-laden\" mental health diagnosis with mental health lying between physical health and a moral judgment. Under this system personality disorders are seen as not very factual and very value-laden while delirium is quite factual and not very value-laden. Biological basis \nIn 2013, psychiatrist Allen Frances said that he believes that \"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\". Mary Boyle argues  that psychiatry is actually the study of behaviour, but acts as if it is the study of the brain based on a presumed connection between patterns of behaviour and the biological function of the brain. She argues that the concept of schizophrenia and its biological basis serves a social function for psychiatrists. She views the concept of schizophrenia is necessary for psychiatry to be considered as a medical field, that the claimed biological link gives psychiatrists protection from accusations of social control. And that the belief in the biological basis for schizophrenia is maintained through secondary source's misrepresentation of underlying data. Nancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability. She argues that overemphasis on psychosis in the diagnostic criteria, while improving diagnostic reliability, ignores more fundamental cognitive impairments that are harder to assess due to large variations in presentation. Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. Treatment\n\nPsychosurgery \n\nPsychosurgery is brain surgery with the aim of changing an individuals behaviour or psychological function. Other forms of ablative psychosurgery were in use in the UK in the late 1970s, to treat psychotic and mood disorders. Bilateral cingulotomy was used to treat substance abuse disorder in Russia until 2002. Psychosurgery was criticized in the US in the late 1960s and 1970s by psychiatrist Peter Breggin. He identified all psychosurgery with the lobotomy as a rhetorical device. Psychosurgeons William Beecher Scoville and Petter Lindström said that Breggin's critique was emotional and not based on facts. Psychosurgery was investigated by the US Senate in the 1973 by the Health Subcommittee of the Senate's Committee on Labor and Public Welfare chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy due to growing concern about the ethical boundaries of science and medicine. At this committee Breggin argued that newer forms of psychosurgery were the same as the lobotomy since it had the same effects \"emotional blunting, passivity, reduced capacity to learn\" and said that psychosurgeons \"represent the greatest future threat that we are going to face for our traditional American values\", arguing that if the US became a totalitarian regime lobotomy and psychosurgery would be the equivalent of the secret police. Electroconvulsive therapy \nElectroconvulsive therapy is a therapy method which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s and is, in a modified form, still in use today, and was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated. Marketing of antipsychotic drugs \nPsychiatry has greatly benefitted by advances in pharmacotherapy. In the past, it was rare, but nowadays child psychiatrists on a regular basis prescribe psychotropic substances for children, for instance Ritalin. Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment. Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer AstraZeneca, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics Carl Elliott noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state mental institution. Anti-psychiatry \n\nThe term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and is understood in current psychiatry to mean opposition to psychiatry's perceived role aspects of treatment. The anti-psychiatry message is that psychiatric treatments are \"ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients“. Psychiatry is seen to involve an \"unequal power relationship between doctor and patient“, and advocates of anti-psychiatry claim a subjective diagnostic process, leaving much room for opinions and interpretations. Three authors have come to personify the movement against psychiatry, of which two are or have been practicing psychiatrists. Michael Foucault challenged the very basis of psychiatric practice and cast it as repressive and controlling. The term \"anti-psychiatry\" itself was coined by David Cooper in 1967. Divergence within psychiatry generated the anti-psychiatry movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and is still present. Issues remaining relevant in contemporary psychiatry are questions of; freedom versus coercion, mind versus brain, nature versus nurture, and the right to be different. The key text in the intellectual development of the survivor movement, at least in the US, was Judi Chamberlin's 1978 text, On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System. Coalescing around the ex-patient newsletter Dendron, in late 1988 leaders from several of the main national and grassroots psychiatric survivor groups felt that an independent, human rights coalition focused on problems in the mental health system was needed. SCI's first public action was to stage a counter-conference and protest in New York City, in May, 1990, at the same time as (and directly outside of) the American Psychiatric Association's annual meeting.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

This enabled the businessman's party, the Republican party, to enjoy a strong base among Protestant blue collar workers, and prevented the emergence of a strong Socialist movement.

This is particularly important, as some Marxist social groups state this to be the downfall of the working class and class analysis. Another example of this dissolution of political and class partnership is Britain's politics; in how political party conflicts tended to focus more on issues instead of interest of the class community.

Some of the key features of society include its organization, culture, values, norms, social structure, and institutions. It involves the division of society into various social groups, such as families, communities, and social classes. Finally, institutions play a vital role in society. These are established systems or organizations that serve specific functions and fulfill collective needs. Examples of institutions include government, education, healthcare, and the economy. Institutions provide a framework for social interaction and governance, helping to maintain order and stability within society. In summary, society is characterized by its organization, culture, values, norms, social structure, and institutions. These characteristics intertwine to shape the fabric of society and influence the behavior and interactions of individuals within it. Society can be understood as a complex web of relationships and interactions between individuals. Society also involves the establishment of social norms, which are shared expectations and behaviors that guide individuals' conduct and facilitate social order. These structures may include educational institutions, economic systems, religious organizations, political systems, and legal frameworks. They provide the framework through which individuals operate and contribute to the functioning of society as a whole. The study of society is a multidisciplinary field, drawing insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, and other social sciences to understand the complexity and dynamics of human interactions in a societal context. It is through these systems of relations between individuals that societies are formed, sustained, and transformed over time. A social network is a social structure composed of individuals (or organizations) called \"nodes\", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from \n\n Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects and institutions, such as health and the institution of medicine; economy; military; punishment and systems of control; the Internet; education; social capital; and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

Therefore, emotion is less consistent than attitude. Attitude is harder to change than emotion.

In both cases, these expectations are often met because this labor is necessary to maximizing monetary gain and potentially to job retention. Indeed, emotional labor is often used as a means to maximize income. Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt to foster a sense of authentic intimacy. literature has connected the construct of positive self-concept, an idea similar to core self-evaluations, to the ability to cope well with organizational change. Furthermore, individual core self-evaluation traits like emotional stability have been linked to job performance in team settings (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1995 as cited in ). found that expressions of positive mood by the leader improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings. Since employee behavior and productivity are directly affected by their emotional states, it is imperative to consider employee emotional responses to organizational leaders. According to a study on mass-retail employees, proactive personality emerged as a protective factor against conflicts with clients, especially among employees experiencing high levels of emotional dissonance. They actively take steps to manage their emotions and engage in adaptive strategies to handle emotional demands effectively. In customer-facing roles, where there is a direct relationship with clients, emotional demands play a crucial role. Emotional dissonance, which refers to the internal experience of mismatched emotions, was found to be associated with more hostile customer relations. Identifying resources that enable the management of emotional demands is crucial in developing suitable adaptive strategies for individuals in customer-facing roles.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about sociology.

It involves the ability of individuals to change their social class or economic status over time. Conversely, limited educational opportunities can hinder social mobility. Furthermore, income inequality can impact social mobility. Social barriers, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status, can also hinder social mobility. These barriers create systemic disadvantages for certain groups and limit their upward mobility. It is the movement between different socio-economic stratas, which can be influenced by various factors such as education, occupation, income, and wealth. People with a higher level of social mobility have the opportunity to improve their socioeconomic status and experience upward mobility, while those with limited mobility may find it challenging to escape poverty or advance economically. In societies with higher social mobility, individuals have a greater chance of overcoming their circumstances and achieving success independent of their social background. It is a measure of the degree to which people can improve their social standing and access better opportunities in terms of education, income, and occupation. In societies with high levels of social mobility, individuals have a greater chance of upward mobility, meaning they can move from a lower socioeconomic status to a higher one. Social mobility can have a significant impact on equality and social justice within a society. A social movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular goal, typically a social or political one. It is a type of group action and may involve individuals, organizations or both. Social movements have been described as \"organizational structures and strategies that may empower oppressed populations to mount effective challenges and resist the more powerful and advantaged elites\". They represent a method of social change from the bottom within nations.

These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called Wertrational or value/belief-oriented.

Weber's \"instrumental rationality\" and Rawls's \"the rational\" became actors' \"causally expected utility\"—satisfaction with workmanlike behavior—and \"evidentially expected utility\"—satisfaction with predicted utility after successful instrumental action.

In two works, A Theory of Justice, published in 1971, and Justice as Fairness, published in 2002, he claimed to have identified one such pattern, valued both for its intrinsic legitimacy and its instrumental efficiency.

Many are formally organized, with constitutions and by-laws, maintain offices, are served by clergy or lay leaders, and, in nations where this is permissible, often seek non-profit corporate status. Depending on the tradition, these organizations may connect local churches to larger church traditions, ordain and defrock clergy, define terms of membership and exercise church discipline, and have organizations for cooperative ministry such as educational institutions and missionary societies. The word church may also be used for other religious communities, although for non-Christian communities the term is sometimes considered archaic or even offensive, while some other non-Christian communities themselves use the word to refer to their community or house of worship. Established Christianity in the United States was experiencing challenges in the second half of the nineteenth century, a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, high rates of immigration, and the growing understanding of evolutionary theory which challenged traditional Christian accounts of history.

When an individual's significant others engage in deviant and/or criminal behavior, criminal behavior will be learned as a result to this exposure. He argues that criminal behavior is learned in the same way that all other behaviors are learned, meaning that the acquisition of criminal knowledge is not unique compared to the learning of other behaviors. Sutherland outlined some very basic points in his theory, including the idea that the learning comes \n\n Sociologist Jack Katz is recognized by many as being a foundational figure to this approach through his seminal work, Seductions of Crime, written in 1988. Recent theories within cultural criminology take into account the role of space (such as urban space) in the construction of crime, positing, for example, that where an action takes place is as important as the effect of the action in determining criminality. Its praxis largely involves direct intervention in economic affairs and seeks to subvert authoritarian, capitalist structures by reappropriating wealth through illegal acts such as theft, counterfeiting, swindling, and robbery. They attributed their financial status to the nature of capitalism, so these actions still had a distinct revolutionary component in these cases.
