An experiment suggested that managers might respond to risk-based auditing by transferring activity to accounts which are ostensibly low risk. Auditors would need to anticipate such attempts to game the process. A scope limitation is a restriction on the applicability of an auditor's report that may arise from the inability to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about a component in the financial statements. When all the audit procedures that are considered necessary, either by circumstances, engagement, or client limitation, the audit is limited in scope. Auditing standards suggest that when restrictions imposed by the client significantly limit the scope of the engagement the auditor should consider disclaiming the opinion. Some scope limitations arise for reasons that are beyond the control of the client, such as fire and flood. Alternative procedures can overcome the risk of the auditor's qualified or disclaimer opinion. Simple procedures to provide sufficient evidence would be necessary for the auditor to adhere to US GAAP. A type of study used in economics, sociology, political science, and psychology, an audit study is one in which trained employees of the researcher (\"auditors\") are matched on all characteristics except the one being tested for discrimination. These auditors then apply for a service, be it a job, financial advice regarding their stock portfolio, housing, or a credit card, to test for discrimination. Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff, and in the context of accounting it is the \"unbiased examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional accounting.

Under IFRS, companies need to record the cost of their Ending Inventory at the lower of cost and NRV, to ensure that their inventory and income statement are not overstated (under ASPE, companies record the lower of cost and market value). For example, under IFRS, at a company's year end, if an unfinished good that already cost $25 is expected to sell for $100 to a customer, but it will take an additional $20 to complete and $10 to advertise to the customer, its NRV will be $100-$20-$10=$70.
