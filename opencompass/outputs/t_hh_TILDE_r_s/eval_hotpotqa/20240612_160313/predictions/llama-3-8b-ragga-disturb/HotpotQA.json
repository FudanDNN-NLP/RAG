It was first formally described in 1845 by Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel in Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae and was given the name Candollea exasperata. In 1900, John Isaac Briquet changed the name to Hibbertia exasperata. Harpagophytum ( ), also called grapple plant, wood spider, and most commonly devil's claw, is a genus of  plants in the sesame family, native to southern Africa. Plants of the genus owe their common name \"devil's claw\" to the peculiar appearance of their hooked fruit. Several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea and certain species of Pisonia, however, are also known by this name. Etymology\nThe genera name is derived from the Greek words harpago meaning hook and phyton meaning plant. Ecology and management \nHarpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Stewart and Cole (2005) examined the complex economic, social, and cultural factors involved in the harvest of the species. Harvest also did not affect growth, although plants in the medium size class grew more during the study period in both the harvested and unharvested populations. Fruit production was highly variable, and mature fruits were produced only under favorable conditions. Under the conditions of this experimental harvest, the species appears to be resilient to harvest, with plants subjected to harvest surviving as well as unharvested plants. However, due to the spatially variable nature of its habitat and the plasticity of the plants themselves, harvesting data from actual harvested areas from a large number of plants is required to better understand the life history of the species.

With only moderate success with their third album, Groove Coverage did not release any more music until late 2007, where they released the single \"Because I Love You\" to promote their first Greatest Hits compilation. formed the Universal Music Group forced its debut album, Antidote, to remain in its vaults, although the single “One More to Go” (featuring Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, Street Life, and GZA) b/w “Bomb Threat,” was released and the album was later leaked. The group was also featured on NBA All-Star and rapper Shaquille O'Neal's 1998 album Respect. After the departure of Finesse due to undisclosed business reasons, the group finally managed to release an album with 2002's Still Standing, on Rocks the World/Caroline/Virgin/EMI Records.\n\n"

At age nineteen, her book was published by Editora Record (the largest publishing company in Latin America.) Mayra wrote “Fugalaça” while she was battling with depression. The author revealed that she went through a catharsis while working on her first novel. The book became an immediate phenomenon amongst Brazilian teenagers and a portrait of a generation unable to deal with frustrations. Satine, the narrator, is the author's alter ego. Both suffered with the sudden death of their father during pre-adolescence and became involved with a world of drugs, obsessive and destructive \n\nThe Heart  is a 2014 realistic and medical fiction novel by the French author Maylis de Kerangal. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. It has been performed as a theater play in France since 2015. Plot \nEarly one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. The couple is then introduced to Thomas, who attempts to convince them to authorize the donation of Simon's organs. Eventually, Marianne realizes that allowing Simon to surf and live his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean had done for him, and she decides to accept Thomas' request to donate Simon's organs. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Marianne Limbres is Simon's mother. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Eventually, he is persuaded by Marianne to allow the hospital to carry out the donations. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. Juliette is Simon's 18-year old girlfriend. Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher are Simon's friends, with whom he went surfing on the day of his death. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cordélia worked in the operating room. Dr. Marthe Carrare is one of the founders of the Biomedical Agency, an organization located within the National Center for the Allocation of Transplants that conducts thorough evaluations of transplant organs and allocates them to various hospitals and patients. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with the passing of their son Simon, a strong, healthy young man who lived his life fearlessly and immensely. To the Limbres, Simon's body is not merely a large mass of skin, tissue, muscle, and bone; it is a tangible symbol for his life, for his existence on Earth, and for the impacts he made on the lives of those who loved him most. Background and development \n\nIn 2007, after watching a television report on heart transplantation, Maylis de Kerangal wrote a short piece titled Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body for Who is Alive?, a compilation book commemorating the 10th anniversary of the French publisher Éditions Verticales. Over the next five years, de Kerangal experienced personal grief and revitalized her interest in heart transplantation, which inspired her to write about the heart not just as an essential organ in the human body like she did in Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body, but as a source of love, emotion, and humanism. She subsequently began writing The Heart in July 2012. While developing and writing the novel, de Kerangal consulted with an organ transplant coordinating nurse at the Biomedicine Agency in Saint-Denis, France, who educated her on the legal aspects of organ transplantation and the process of obtaining consent from family members of the deceased. She then met with an emergency physician at the agency who introduced her to Cristal, a software that stores medical records, serves as a database of patients awaiting organ donations, matches donors with suitable recipients, and protects their identities. Critical reception \nUpon its initial release in France in 2014, The Heart was widely lauded. French journalist and author Pierre Assouline referred to The Heart as \"a novel of great beauty, a writing, a language dazzling\" and as \"fine and intelligent without ever pushing the collar.\" In his review, French journalist and television personality Bernard Pivot described The Heart as a \"story driven with [the] surgical precision of a heart transplant\" and called it \"an extraordinary novel that now classifies Maylis de Kerangal among the major writers of the early twenty-first century.\" French cultural and television magazine Télérama gave The Heart a five-star rating and commended the continuous flow and musicality of de Kerangal's prose. In her review for The New York Times, Priya Parmar recounted the novel as a \"...story [that] unfolds in an intricate lacework of precise detail\" and described the characters as \"less like fictional creations and more like ordinary people, briefly illuminated in rich language, beautifully translated by Sam Taylor, that veers from the medical to the philosophical.\" In her critique for the American edition of The Guardian, Lydia Kiesling emphasized on how The Heart embodied the importance of narratives to medicine and vice versa, and also commended de Kerangal as a \"master of momentum\" who \"liberates medicine from the language that, by necessity, has constrained its practice.\" In an entry titled \"A Poetic Novel About Grief\" for his blog Gates Notes, Bill Gates described The Heart  as \"poetry disguised as a novel\" that deftly formed a strong connection between readers and characters who appear only briefly in the novel, and that compelled him to \"feel the depth of grief,\" which he identified as a fulfilling and insightful personal experience.

The author revealed that she went through a catharsis while working on her first novel.

The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. It has been performed as a theater play in France since 2015. Plot \nEarly one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. Révol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. The couple is then introduced to Thomas, who attempts to convince them to authorize the donation of Simon's organs. Eventually, Marianne realizes that allowing Simon to surf and live his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean had done for him, and she decides to accept Thomas' request to donate Simon's organs. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Marianne Limbres is Simon's mother. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Eventually, he is persuaded by Marianne to allow the hospital to carry out the donations. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. Juliette is Simon's 18-year old girlfriend. Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher are Simon's friends, with whom he went surfing on the day of his death. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cordélia worked in the operating room. Dr. Marthe Carrare is one of the founders of the Biomedical Agency, an organization located within the National Center for the Allocation of Transplants that conducts thorough evaluations of transplant organs and allocates them to various hospitals and patients. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with the passing of their son Simon, a strong, healthy young man who lived his life fearlessly and immensely. To the Limbres, Simon's body is not merely a large mass of skin, tissue, muscle, and bone; it is a tangible symbol for his life, for his existence on Earth, and for the impacts he made on the lives of those who loved him most. Background and development \n\nIn 2007, after watching a television report on heart transplantation, Maylis de Kerangal wrote a short piece titled Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body for Who is Alive?, a compilation book commemorating the 10th anniversary of the French publisher Éditions Verticales. Over the next five years, de Kerangal experienced personal grief and revitalized her interest in heart transplantation, which inspired her to write about the heart not just as an essential organ in the human body like she did in Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body, but as a source of love, emotion, and humanism. She subsequently began writing The Heart in July 2012. While developing and writing the novel, de Kerangal consulted with an organ transplant coordinating nurse at the Biomedicine Agency in Saint-Denis, France, who educated her on the legal aspects of organ transplantation and the process of obtaining consent from family members of the deceased.

He also scoffed at her recommendation that teachers find better literature to share with their students: \"I would dearly like to see Ms. Cameron trying to read \n\n Women, or Robinson Crusoe for that matter to a class of today's children. In her essay, Cameron also decried the Oompa-Loompas, who were portrayed as abused, half-naked, African pygmy slaves. In its combining reality and magic, Pluk is often mentioned alongside Roald Dahl's The BFG. The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.\n\n"

Krotite was reported in 2011 in a calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion (CAI) in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorite NWA (North West Africa) 1934, which landed in Morocco. The mineral name was approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA 2010-038) and honors Alexander N. Krot, a researcher in cosmochemistry at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, Hawaii. Researchers have found that the mineral, which has the same atomic arrangement as a man-made component of some types of concrete, forms under low pressure at a temperature of at least 1500 C. These conditions of high temperature and low pressure are consistent with a hypothesis that the \n\n Artinite (IMA symbol: Art ) is a hydrated magnesium carbonate mineral with formula: Mg2(CO3)(OH)2·3H2O. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and a specific gravity of 2. It occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal veins and in serpentinized ultramafic rocks. Associated minerals include brucite, hydromagnesite, pyroaurite, chrysotile, aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite. Hydroxyapatite, also called hydroxylapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca5(PO4)3(OH), but it is usually written Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH− ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of dental fluorosis. Up to 50% by volume and 70% by weight of human bone is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, known as bone mineral. Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are composed. Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the pineal gland and other structures, known as corpora arenacea or \"brain sand\". The hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below:\n\n10 Ca(OH)2 + 6 H3PO4 → Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 18 H2O\n\nThe ability to synthetically replicate hydroxyapatite has invaluable clinical implications, especially in dentistry. Stoichiometric apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO42−, anions. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness. A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by amelogenins and enamelins instead of collagen. Hydroxyapatite is the main mineral component of enamel in teeth. Avian eggshell hydroxyapatite  can be a viable filler material in bone regeneration procedures in oral surgery. Hydroxyapatite has shown significant medium and long-term desensitizing effects on dentine hypersensitivity using evaporative stimuli and the visual analogue scale (alongside potassium nitrate, arginine, glutaraldehyde with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyapatite, adhesive systems, glass ionomer cements and laser). To prevent this, nano-hydroxyapatite can be added to the bleaching solution to reduce the impact of the bleaching agent by blocking pores within the enamel. Caries prevention \nNano-hydroxyapatite possesses a remineralising effect on teeth and can be used to prevent damage from carious attacks. It is chemically similar to naturally occurring hydroxyapatite and can mimic the structure and biological function of the structures found in the resident extracellular matrix. As a dental material \nHydroxyapatite is widely used within dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, due to its chemical similarity to hard tissue. In recent years, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (nHA) have been used in toothpaste to combat dental hypersensitivity. It involves ionic interactions between positively charged groups on a biomolecule (often a protein) and the phosphate groups in hydroxyapatite, and metal chelation between hydroxyapatite calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate and/or carboxyl groups on the biomolecule. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of trace elements, including carbon, oxygen and strontium. Defluoridation\nHydroxyapatite is a potential adsorbent for the defluoridation of drinking water, as it forms fluorapatite in a three step process. However, during the defluoridation process the hydroxyapatite dissolves, and increases the pH and phosphate ion concentration which makes the defluoridated water unfit for drinking.

While not the highest in U.S. casualties, the subsequent Battle for Luzon was the highest net casualty battle U.S. forces fought in World War II, with 192,000 to 217,000 Japanese combatants dead, though some sources quote losses as high as 380,000 for the entire conflict including non-combat casualties (mostly from starvation and disease). The Battle for the Recapture of Corregidor (Filipino: Labanan para sa Corregidor), which occurred from the 16th to the 26th of February, 1945, pitted American forces against the defending Japanese garrison on the island fortress. The Japanese had captured the bastion from the United States Army Forces in the Far East during their 1942 invasion. The battle was waged to complete the recapture of the central portions south of the archipelago and secure them from remaining Japanese forces.\n\n"

The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products. The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland.

White Oak Federal Research Center \nSince 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on  of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately  of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately  of office and special use space to their existing facilities. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. Other locations \nThe FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Scope and funding\nAs of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. Regulatory programs\n\nEmergency  approvals (EUA)\n\nEmergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. \"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"\nThe FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry. There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\". Medical countermeasures (MCMs)\n\nMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. The FDA runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. Medications\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. A drug is considered \"new\" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different excipients or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. New medications\n\nNew drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a new drug application (NDA). Under the Trump administration, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster. New drugs are available only by prescription by default. A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. (See FDA Special Protocol Assessment about Phase III trials.) Post-market safety surveillance\nAfter NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis. The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program. While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely. For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing \n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices. On March 18, 2020, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died. Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology\n\nThe Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents. These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs. The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 Biologics Control Act, with additional authority established by the 1944 Public Health Service Act. Along with these Acts, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the National Institutes of Health; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972. Medical and radiation-emitting devices\n\nThe Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complex devices such as implantable neurostimulators. \"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"\nClearance requests are required for medical devices that prove they are \"substantially equivalent\" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate \"safety and efficacy\", for example they may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Veterinary products\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals. The FDA's requirements to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers. CVM does not regulate vaccines for animals; these are handled by the United States Department of Agriculture. Tobacco products\nThe FDA regulates tobacco products with authority established by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Surgeon General. In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device. A more recent example of the FDA's international work is their 2018 cooperation with regulatory and law-enforcement agencies worldwide through Interpol as part of Operation Pangea XI. The FDA targeted 465 websites that illegally sold potentially dangerous, unapproved versions of opioid, oncology, and antiviral prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. Science and research programs\n\nThe FDA carries out research and development activities to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments. The FDA's research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women's health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine. Data management\nThe FDA has collected a large amount of data through the decades. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse named Jim who had contracted tetanus. The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry. In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective. When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove oxymorphone hydrochloride from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history. 21st century reforms\n\nCritical Path Initiative\nThe Critical Path Initiative is the FDA's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products. A 2006 court case, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. Pediatric drug testing\nPrior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective. An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate. President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 which extended the authorization until 2017. Rules for generic biologics\nSince the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher's Disease patients for life. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. Characterized as \"corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk,\" these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report on the agency as well. The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.

FDA also advances the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and affordable; and by helping the public get the accurate, science based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health. 2/ The FY 2015 and FY 2016 appropriations directed FDA to transfer a total of $1.5 million to the HHS Office of Inspector General for oversight activities. 3/ The Drug Quality and Security Act (P.L. 113-54) authorized three new FDA user fees: the outsourcing facility fees; the prescription drug wholesale distributer licensing and inspection; and, the third-party logistics provider licensing and inspection fees. FDA expects that collections for wholesale distributer and third-party logics provider fees in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 will be minimal. 4/ The FY 2017 President’s Budget proposes to increase the statutory user fee limit for export certification. The FY 2017 Budget includes $5.1 billion in total resources for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an increase of $358 million, or 8 percent above FY 2016. Of this increase, $15 million is in budget authority, $269 million in user fees, and $75 million in new mandatory funding. FDA estimates that Americans pay about two cents per day to ensure that the products FDA regulates, representing more than 20 percent of every consumer dollar spent on products in the United States are safe and effective. The Budget will continue to invest in transforming the food safety system to address today’s challenges, ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical products, supporting the Department’s preparedness enterprise, reducing tobacco use, and conducting innovative research. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was enacted in 2011 and provided FDA with the authorities to transform the food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness and other food hazards to preventing them. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. This total includes $1.3 billion in budget authority and $210 million in user fees. In FY 2017, FDA will focus on implementing produce standards for packing, harvesting, and growing fruits and vegetables; and ensuring imported foods meet the same standards of safety as those in the United States. The additional $193 million in new resources are vital to fully support robust implementation of a prevention based food safety system. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade. These programs include: the voluntary qualified importer program, export certification, third party auditor program, and the food reinspection and recall fees. In FY 2017, the FDA food safety portfolio will continue to support other vital food and feed safety activities that are important to the public such as improving the availability of nutritional information to assist with decisions made by individuals and their families, ensuring that food additives and coloring meet standards set by FDA, and guarding public health by ensuring information on food labels is based on the most current science. For example, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is proposing to update the Nutrition Facts Label to better reflect new scientific information and changed consumer preferences. FDA continues to make significant progress in reducing the number of drug shortages, from a high of 251 shortages in 2011 to just 44 new shortages in 2014. As the global market grows and complex challenges arise, FDA is working to keep pace with the latest science and leverage state, local, and foreign partnerships to protect the public health. Initiatives across FDA programs continue to address new and emerging technologies in regulatory science including 3-D printing, genome sequencing, and computer simulations. FDA ensures the safety, quality and effectiveness of a broad scope of medical products used by Americans including biologics such as vaccines, blood products, and gene therapies, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, radiation emitting products, and medical devices ranging from dental devices to surgical implants. This significant accomplishment represents the next step to increasing treatment options for patients. These activities will continue in FY 2017 to improve patient safety by establishing systems that will allow standardized approaches to quickly and efficiently identify drug and device products in the market and streamline the way biologics are reviewed. In addition, in 2015, FDA successfully launched a mobile application to improve public access to information, including current drug shortages, and resolve drug shortages and discontinuations of drug products. In FY 2017, FDA will continue to invest in developing a safer and more modern drug supply system by building on the infrastructure to process biological product applications and support integration of the Unique Facility Identifier into IT systems that support regulatory work. FDA supports the program’s goal to enhance access to high‑quality, lower cost generic drugs. Medical product safety investments in the FY 2017 Budget total $2.8 billion at the program level, $116 million above FY 2016. The Budget will advance FDA’s highest priority activities to ensure that human and animal drugs, biologics, and medical devices available to the American public meet current requirements and standards for safety. In FY 2017, FDA activities include but are not limited to domestic and foreign drug establishment inspections, pre-and post-market product surveillance, research on biologics, human drugs, and devices to help inform FDA program’s and the medical product community, and review of new medical products that will be available to the public. The Budget includes a total of approximately $18 million in budget authority, an increase of $1 million above FY 2016, to continue and extend FDA’s oversight of drugs produced by compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities. Increased efforts in these areas will help to prevent outbreaks that could result in deaths or injuries to patients who receive compounded drugs. Oversight of compounding facilities is critical to protecting patients. In FY 2015, FDA conducted 116 inspections of compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities across the nation. Funding requested in the Budget will build on FY 2016 activities, including inspection and enforcement, developing policies that will ensure compliance with the Drug Quality and Security Act, and facilitating state collaboration and coordination. The Budget includes $42 million in support of the Administration’s National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, the same as FY 2016, which will advance efforts to support the judicious use of medically‑important antimicrobials in food‑producing animals, to evaluate new antibacterial drugs for patient treatments, to streamline clinical trials, and to develop better vaccines for antibiotic resistant organisms. Fighting antibiotic resistance is both a public health and national security priority, and FDA has made strides to make sure effective antibiotics are available in the future. The Budget will build on FDA’s current work in this area, which includes implementing the Veterinary Feed Directive, which would make illegal the use of medically important antibiotics for animal production purposes and bring remaining uses for legitimate animal health purposes under veterinary supervision. In January 2015, the Precision Medicine Initiative was launched to empower health care providers to tailor treatment and prevention strategies to individuals’ unique characteristics and genetic makeup. To that end, FDA developed precisionFDA, an online, cloud-based, portal that will allow scientists from industry, academia, government and other partners to come together to foster innovation and develop the science behind a method of reading DNA known as next‑generation sequencing. FDA is also a key participant in the President’s Precision Medicine Initiative. In the last year, FDA has approved several new Precision Medicine-based therapies and launched precisionFDA, a platform for academic and commercial collaboration. The Budget includes $4 million, an increase of $2 million above FY 2016, to support these activities including supporting precisionFDA and working with the scientific community to develop new reference datasets for validating genetic tests. FDA’s advancement of precision medicine will help reduce the burden of disease by targeting prevention and treatment more effectively. These efforts directly support precision medicine activities across HHS. The Budget also provides $75 million in mandatory resources over five years in order to accelerate progress in cancer as part of the Vice President’s Cancer “Moonshot” initiative. FDA will closely interface with the NIH National Cancer Institute to streamline the development and expedite the approval of novel devices, drugs, biologics, and combination products. FDA will also support improved access to new treatments through cancer clinical trials and access programs, and will enhance sharing of cancer data from clinical trials to promote biological and clinical breakthroughs. FDA infrastructure and facilities, including 56 laboratories strategically located across the continental United States and Puerto Rico, directly support mission critical work and enable FDA to respond to food safety and medical product safety activities. These responsibilities have increased as a result of groundbreaking legislation Congress has passed over recent years, and as a result, FDA has experienced a significant increase in its workforce to carry out these activities. The FY 2017 Budget ensures that FDA facilities are optimally functioning to carry out its growing responsibilities for food and medical product safety. The Budget invests a total of $423 million, $4 million above FY 2016, in FDA infrastructure including costs to keep up with the science and continue planned activities in the White Oak Complex. In 2016, FDA will complete a feasibility study at the White Oak Campus to address its expanded workforce as well as the continued consolidation and construction required to accommodate them. These resources will also ensure FDA’s leased offices and labs across the country are functional and support the workforce in meeting its public health mission. In addition, the Budget provides $12 million, an increase of $3 million above FY 2016, to fund repair and maintenance of FDA-owned facilities. This investment will begin to address high priority needs across owned facilities to ensure FDA can achieve its regulatory responsibilities, strategic priorities, and program initiatives. These investments directly support FDA’s ability to carry out its responsibilities in facilities that can meet modern challenges. FDA supports the establishment and sustainment of an adequate supply of medical countermeasures to protect against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and emerging infectious disease threats. FDA approved the majority of medical countermeasure marketing applications under review in FY 2015 that met standards for safety, efficacy, and quality. The FY 2017 Budget includes $25 million to continue the Medical Countermeasures Initiative program which directly supports FDA’s countermeasures efforts across the agency and the Department’s preparedness activities. This legislation has enabled FDA to make significant progress towards making tobacco-related death and disease a part of the nation’s past and not its future. FDA, through the Center for Tobacco Products, executes its regulatory and public health responsibilities in program areas that support the following objectives: preventing initiation, particularly among youth; decreasing the harms of tobacco product use; and encouraging cessation. The Center for Tobacco Products continues to build on accomplishments to prevent tobacco use in youth; educate Americans on the harms of tobacco products; ensure compliance with the Tobacco Control Act; review new tobacco products and changes to existing products to reduce harm; and, support cutting edge research. In May 2015, FDA launched the first phase of its “Fresh Empire” campaign, which is designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use among at-risk multi‑racial youth aged 12 to 17 who may become regular smokers. In 2017, FDA will continue to build on these campaigns to reach out to youth. The FY 2017 Budget includes $596 million in user fees to support the FDA tobacco program and contributes to the Department’s crosscutting efforts to reduce tobacco use in the United States. FDA will focus resources on five strategic priorities: 1) product standards to protect public health; 2) an FDA‑wide nicotine regulatory policy; 3) premarket and post market product controls: regulations and product reviews; 4) compliance and enforcement through inspections, investigations, monitoring, and review of covered tobacco products; and 5) public education efforts particularly among youth. The Budget assumes resources from five new user fee programs, an increase to one currently authorized fee program, and scheduled increases in all currently authorized user fee programs. Resources from user fees are critical to enable FDA to carry out its mission and institute performance metrics that lead to greater efficiencies and increased speed at which products are available to the public. First, the Budget continues to propose the international courier user fee, which would provide $6 million to support activities associated with increased surveillance related to the increased volume of FDA‑regulated commodities, predominantly medical products, imported through express courier hubs. This request also includes the proposed cosmetic user fee totaling $20 million to support FDA’s role in ensuring the safety of cosmetic products in the United States as the volume of both domestic and imported cosmetic products continues to grow and manufacturing technology and ingredients become more complex. Finally, the Budget proposes to increase the allowable fee amount for the export certification fee to keep up with the growing costs of these certification activities. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) procures funding and manages alliances with public and private institutions in support of the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the premier medical research agency. The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, cosmetics and products that emit radiation, and by regulating the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is the nation’s medical research agency—making important medical discoveries that improve health and save lives. Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, Americans today are living longer and healthier. In recent years, nationwide rates of new diagnoses and deaths from all cancers combined have fallen significantly. PhRMA members alone invested an estimated $45.8 billion in 2009 in discovering and developing new medicines. Industry-wide research and investment reached a record $65.3 billion in 2009. CMS is charged with setting payment policies and promoting innovation that will increase health care quality, lower costs and improve the health of all Americans, ensuring that more than 100 million Americans have access to the hospital and doctors’ services, prescription medication, nursing home care and other essential services they need. BIO is the world’s largest biotechnology organization, providing advocacy, business development and communications services for more than 1,100 members worldwide. We also represent state and regional biotech associations, service providers to the industry and academic centers. The agency is responsible for overseeing and regulating a wide range of products, including food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and more. The primary objective of the FDA is to protect and promote public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. For example, the FDA enforces the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), which sets the standards and regulations for food, drugs, and cosmetics marketed in the United States. In addition to the FD&C Act, the FDA also enforces other laws and regulations, such as Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. This wide-ranging authority allows the FDA to address public health concerns beyond food and drugs. They regulate and control items like medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, animal foods and feed, and veterinary products. They are dedicated to upholding public health standards and promoting the safety of the American population. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products. The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland.

White Oak Federal Research Center \nSince 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on  of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately  of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately  of office and special use space to their existing facilities. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. Other locations \nThe FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Scope and funding\nAs of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. Regulatory programs\n\nEmergency  approvals (EUA)\n\nEmergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. \"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"\nThe FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry. There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\". Medical countermeasures (MCMs)\n\nMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. The FDA runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. Medications\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. A drug is considered \"new\" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different excipients or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. New medications\n\nNew drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a new drug application (NDA). Under the Trump administration, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster. New drugs are available only by prescription by default. A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. (See FDA Special Protocol Assessment about Phase III trials.) Post-market safety surveillance\nAfter NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis. The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program. While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely. For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing \n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices. On March 18, 2020, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died. Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology\n\nThe Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents. These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs. The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 Biologics Control Act, with additional authority established by the 1944 Public Health Service Act. Along with these Acts, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the National Institutes of Health; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972. Medical and radiation-emitting devices\n\nThe Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complex devices such as implantable neurostimulators. \"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"\nClearance requests are required for medical devices that prove they are \"substantially equivalent\" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate \"safety and efficacy\", for example they may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Veterinary products\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals. The FDA's requirements to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers. CVM does not regulate vaccines for animals; these are handled by the United States Department of Agriculture. Tobacco products\nThe FDA regulates tobacco products with authority established by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Surgeon General. In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device. A more recent example of the FDA's international work is their 2018 cooperation with regulatory and law-enforcement agencies worldwide through Interpol as part of Operation Pangea XI. The FDA targeted 465 websites that illegally sold potentially dangerous, unapproved versions of opioid, oncology, and antiviral prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. Science and research programs\n\nThe FDA carries out research and development activities to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments. The FDA's research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women's health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine. Data management\nThe FDA has collected a large amount of data through the decades. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse named Jim who had contracted tetanus. The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry. In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective. When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove oxymorphone hydrochloride from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history. 21st century reforms\n\nCritical Path Initiative\nThe Critical Path Initiative is the FDA's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products. A 2006 court case, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. Pediatric drug testing\nPrior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective. An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate. President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 which extended the authorization until 2017. Rules for generic biologics\nSince the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher's Disease patients for life. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. Characterized as \"corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk,\" these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report on the agency as well. The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.

Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. Characterized as \"corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk,\" these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report on the agency as well. The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.

FDA also advances the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and affordable; and by helping the public get the accurate, science based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health. 2/ The FY 2015 and FY 2016 appropriations directed FDA to transfer a total of $1.5 million to the HHS Office of Inspector General for oversight activities. 3/ The Drug Quality and Security Act (P.L. 113-54) authorized three new FDA user fees: the outsourcing facility fees; the prescription drug wholesale distributer licensing and inspection; and, the third-party logistics provider licensing and inspection fees. FDA expects that collections for wholesale distributer and third-party logics provider fees in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 will be minimal. 4/ The FY 2017 President’s Budget proposes to increase the statutory user fee limit for export certification. The FY 2017 Budget includes $5.1 billion in total resources for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an increase of $358 million, or 8 percent above FY 2016. Of this increase, $15 million is in budget authority, $269 million in user fees, and $75 million in new mandatory funding. FDA estimates that Americans pay about two cents per day to ensure that the products FDA regulates, representing more than 20 percent of every consumer dollar spent on products in the United States are safe and effective. The Budget will continue to invest in transforming the food safety system to address today’s challenges, ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical products, supporting the Department’s preparedness enterprise, reducing tobacco use, and conducting innovative research. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was enacted in 2011 and provided FDA with the authorities to transform the food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness and other food hazards to preventing them. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. This total includes $1.3 billion in budget authority and $210 million in user fees. In FY 2017, FDA will focus on implementing produce standards for packing, harvesting, and growing fruits and vegetables; and ensuring imported foods meet the same standards of safety as those in the United States. The additional $193 million in new resources are vital to fully support robust implementation of a prevention based food safety system. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade. These programs include: the voluntary qualified importer program, export certification, third party auditor program, and the food reinspection and recall fees. In FY 2017, the FDA food safety portfolio will continue to support other vital food and feed safety activities that are important to the public such as improving the availability of nutritional information to assist with decisions made by individuals and their families, ensuring that food additives and coloring meet standards set by FDA, and guarding public health by ensuring information on food labels is based on the most current science. For example, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is proposing to update the Nutrition Facts Label to better reflect new scientific information and changed consumer preferences. FDA continues to make significant progress in reducing the number of drug shortages, from a high of 251 shortages in 2011 to just 44 new shortages in 2014. As the global market grows and complex challenges arise, FDA is working to keep pace with the latest science and leverage state, local, and foreign partnerships to protect the public health. Initiatives across FDA programs continue to address new and emerging technologies in regulatory science including 3-D printing, genome sequencing, and computer simulations. FDA ensures the safety, quality and effectiveness of a broad scope of medical products used by Americans including biologics such as vaccines, blood products, and gene therapies, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, radiation emitting products, and medical devices ranging from dental devices to surgical implants. This significant accomplishment represents the next step to increasing treatment options for patients. These activities will continue in FY 2017 to improve patient safety by establishing systems that will allow standardized approaches to quickly and efficiently identify drug and device products in the market and streamline the way biologics are reviewed. In addition, in 2015, FDA successfully launched a mobile application to improve public access to information, including current drug shortages, and resolve drug shortages and discontinuations of drug products. In FY 2017, FDA will continue to invest in developing a safer and more modern drug supply system by building on the infrastructure to process biological product applications and support integration of the Unique Facility Identifier into IT systems that support regulatory work. FDA supports the program’s goal to enhance access to high‑quality, lower cost generic drugs. Medical product safety investments in the FY 2017 Budget total $2.8 billion at the program level, $116 million above FY 2016. The Budget will advance FDA’s highest priority activities to ensure that human and animal drugs, biologics, and medical devices available to the American public meet current requirements and standards for safety. In FY 2017, FDA activities include but are not limited to domestic and foreign drug establishment inspections, pre-and post-market product surveillance, research on biologics, human drugs, and devices to help inform FDA program’s and the medical product community, and review of new medical products that will be available to the public. The Budget includes a total of approximately $18 million in budget authority, an increase of $1 million above FY 2016, to continue and extend FDA’s oversight of drugs produced by compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities. Increased efforts in these areas will help to prevent outbreaks that could result in deaths or injuries to patients who receive compounded drugs. Oversight of compounding facilities is critical to protecting patients. In FY 2015, FDA conducted 116 inspections of compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities across the nation. Funding requested in the Budget will build on FY 2016 activities, including inspection and enforcement, developing policies that will ensure compliance with the Drug Quality and Security Act, and facilitating state collaboration and coordination. The Budget includes $42 million in support of the Administration’s National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, the same as FY 2016, which will advance efforts to support the judicious use of medically‑important antimicrobials in food‑producing animals, to evaluate new antibacterial drugs for patient treatments, to streamline clinical trials, and to develop better vaccines for antibiotic resistant organisms. Fighting antibiotic resistance is both a public health and national security priority, and FDA has made strides to make sure effective antibiotics are available in the future. The Budget will build on FDA’s current work in this area, which includes implementing the Veterinary Feed Directive, which would make illegal the use of medically important antibiotics for animal production purposes and bring remaining uses for legitimate animal health purposes under veterinary supervision. In January 2015, the Precision Medicine Initiative was launched to empower health care providers to tailor treatment and prevention strategies to individuals’ unique characteristics and genetic makeup. To that end, FDA developed precisionFDA, an online, cloud-based, portal that will allow scientists from industry, academia, government and other partners to come together to foster innovation and develop the science behind a method of reading DNA known as next‑generation sequencing. FDA is also a key participant in the President’s Precision Medicine Initiative. In the last year, FDA has approved several new Precision Medicine-based therapies and launched precisionFDA, a platform for academic and commercial collaboration. The Budget includes $4 million, an increase of $2 million above FY 2016, to support these activities including supporting precisionFDA and working with the scientific community to develop new reference datasets for validating genetic tests. FDA’s advancement of precision medicine will help reduce the burden of disease by targeting prevention and treatment more effectively. These efforts directly support precision medicine activities across HHS. The Budget also provides $75 million in mandatory resources over five years in order to accelerate progress in cancer as part of the Vice President’s Cancer “Moonshot” initiative. FDA will closely interface with the NIH National Cancer Institute to streamline the development and expedite the approval of novel devices, drugs, biologics, and combination products. FDA will also support improved access to new treatments through cancer clinical trials and access programs, and will enhance sharing of cancer data from clinical trials to promote biological and clinical breakthroughs. FDA infrastructure and facilities, including 56 laboratories strategically located across the continental United States and Puerto Rico, directly support mission critical work and enable FDA to respond to food safety and medical product safety activities. These responsibilities have increased as a result of groundbreaking legislation Congress has passed over recent years, and as a result, FDA has experienced a significant increase in its workforce to carry out these activities. The FY 2017 Budget ensures that FDA facilities are optimally functioning to carry out its growing responsibilities for food and medical product safety. The Budget invests a total of $423 million, $4 million above FY 2016, in FDA infrastructure including costs to keep up with the science and continue planned activities in the White Oak Complex. In 2016, FDA will complete a feasibility study at the White Oak Campus to address its expanded workforce as well as the continued consolidation and construction required to accommodate them. These resources will also ensure FDA’s leased offices and labs across the country are functional and support the workforce in meeting its public health mission. In addition, the Budget provides $12 million, an increase of $3 million above FY 2016, to fund repair and maintenance of FDA-owned facilities. This investment will begin to address high priority needs across owned facilities to ensure FDA can achieve its regulatory responsibilities, strategic priorities, and program initiatives. These investments directly support FDA’s ability to carry out its responsibilities in facilities that can meet modern challenges. FDA supports the establishment and sustainment of an adequate supply of medical countermeasures to protect against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and emerging infectious disease threats. FDA approved the majority of medical countermeasure marketing applications under review in FY 2015 that met standards for safety, efficacy, and quality. The FY 2017 Budget includes $25 million to continue the Medical Countermeasures Initiative program which directly supports FDA’s countermeasures efforts across the agency and the Department’s preparedness activities. This legislation has enabled FDA to make significant progress towards making tobacco-related death and disease a part of the nation’s past and not its future. FDA, through the Center for Tobacco Products, executes its regulatory and public health responsibilities in program areas that support the following objectives: preventing initiation, particularly among youth; decreasing the harms of tobacco product use; and encouraging cessation. The Center for Tobacco Products continues to build on accomplishments to prevent tobacco use in youth; educate Americans on the harms of tobacco products; ensure compliance with the Tobacco Control Act; review new tobacco products and changes to existing products to reduce harm; and, support cutting edge research. In May 2015, FDA launched the first phase of its “Fresh Empire” campaign, which is designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use among at-risk multi‑racial youth aged 12 to 17 who may become regular smokers. In 2017, FDA will continue to build on these campaigns to reach out to youth. The FY 2017 Budget includes $596 million in user fees to support the FDA tobacco program and contributes to the Department’s crosscutting efforts to reduce tobacco use in the United States. FDA will focus resources on five strategic priorities: 1) product standards to protect public health; 2) an FDA‑wide nicotine regulatory policy; 3) premarket and post market product controls: regulations and product reviews; 4) compliance and enforcement through inspections, investigations, monitoring, and review of covered tobacco products; and 5) public education efforts particularly among youth. The Budget assumes resources from five new user fee programs, an increase to one currently authorized fee program, and scheduled increases in all currently authorized user fee programs. Resources from user fees are critical to enable FDA to carry out its mission and institute performance metrics that lead to greater efficiencies and increased speed at which products are available to the public. First, the Budget continues to propose the international courier user fee, which would provide $6 million to support activities associated with increased surveillance related to the increased volume of FDA‑regulated commodities, predominantly medical products, imported through express courier hubs. This request also includes the proposed cosmetic user fee totaling $20 million to support FDA’s role in ensuring the safety of cosmetic products in the United States as the volume of both domestic and imported cosmetic products continues to grow and manufacturing technology and ingredients become more complex. Finally, the Budget proposes to increase the allowable fee amount for the export certification fee to keep up with the growing costs of these certification activities. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) procures funding and manages alliances with public and private institutions in support of the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the premier medical research agency. The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, cosmetics and products that emit radiation, and by regulating the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is the nation’s medical research agency—making important medical discoveries that improve health and save lives. Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, Americans today are living longer and healthier. In recent years, nationwide rates of new diagnoses and deaths from all cancers combined have fallen significantly. PhRMA members alone invested an estimated $45.8 billion in 2009 in discovering and developing new medicines. Industry-wide research and investment reached a record $65.3 billion in 2009. CMS is charged with setting payment policies and promoting innovation that will increase health care quality, lower costs and improve the health of all Americans, ensuring that more than 100 million Americans have access to the hospital and doctors’ services, prescription medication, nursing home care and other essential services they need. BIO is the world’s largest biotechnology organization, providing advocacy, business development and communications services for more than 1,100 members worldwide. We also represent state and regional biotech associations, service providers to the industry and academic centers. The agency is responsible for overseeing and regulating a wide range of products, including food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and more. The primary objective of the FDA is to protect and promote public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. For example, the FDA enforces the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), which sets the standards and regulations for food, drugs, and cosmetics marketed in the United States. In addition to the FD&C Act, the FDA also enforces other laws and regulations, such as Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. This wide-ranging authority allows the FDA to address public health concerns beyond food and drugs. They regulate and control items like medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, animal foods and feed, and veterinary products. They are dedicated to upholding public health standards and promoting the safety of the American population. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products. The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland.

White Oak Federal Research Center \nSince 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on  of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately  of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately  of office and special use space to their existing facilities. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. Other locations \nThe FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Scope and funding\nAs of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. Regulatory programs\n\nEmergency  approvals (EUA)\n\nEmergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. \"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"\nThe FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry. There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\". Medical countermeasures (MCMs)\n\nMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. The FDA runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. Medications\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. A drug is considered \"new\" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different excipients or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. New medications\n\nNew drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a new drug application (NDA). Under the Trump administration, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster. New drugs are available only by prescription by default. A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. (See FDA Special Protocol Assessment about Phase III trials.) Post-market safety surveillance\nAfter NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis. The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program. While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely. For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing \n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices. On March 18, 2020, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died. Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology\n\nThe Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents. These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs. The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 Biologics Control Act, with additional authority established by the 1944 Public Health Service Act. Along with these Acts, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the National Institutes of Health; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972. Medical and radiation-emitting devices\n\nThe Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complex devices such as implantable neurostimulators. \"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"\nClearance requests are required for medical devices that prove they are \"substantially equivalent\" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate \"safety and efficacy\", for example they may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Veterinary products\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals. The FDA's requirements to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers. CVM does not regulate vaccines for animals; these are handled by the United States Department of Agriculture. Tobacco products\nThe FDA regulates tobacco products with authority established by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Surgeon General. In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device. A more recent example of the FDA's international work is their 2018 cooperation with regulatory and law-enforcement agencies worldwide through Interpol as part of Operation Pangea XI. The FDA targeted 465 websites that illegally sold potentially dangerous, unapproved versions of opioid, oncology, and antiviral prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. Science and research programs\n\nThe FDA carries out research and development activities to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments. The FDA's research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women's health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine. Data management\nThe FDA has collected a large amount of data through the decades. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse named Jim who had contracted tetanus. The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry. In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective. When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove oxymorphone hydrochloride from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history. 21st century reforms\n\nCritical Path Initiative\nThe Critical Path Initiative is the FDA's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products. A 2006 court case, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. Pediatric drug testing\nPrior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective. An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate. President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 which extended the authorization until 2017. Rules for generic biologics\nSince the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher's Disease patients for life. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process.

The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.

While the overwhelming success of the song overshadows other aspects of Boone’s career, the eternally optimistic singer has had a varied and successful career in multiple musical genres. She also talks about members of her famous family, and the conversation goes well beyond her legendary father Pat Boone. Debby is also related to two other iconic and hugely important musical performers: country singer Red Foley and singer/actress Rosemary Clooney. Foley, considered one of the most important figures in the history of country music, was Boone’s maternal grandfather, and Clooney, who recorded some of the most popular pop songs of the early 1950s, was Boone’s mother-in-law. In a free-flowing, casual interview, Boone talks about her famous relations, and Neil also speaks with John Rumble, senior historian at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, who offers some insights into Foley’s career.

In the late 1970s, when Neil Diamond was asked to star in the movie the Jazz Singer, his career was at the peak of popularity, and he had not only established himself as an elite performer, but also an accomplished songwriter. Similarly, Gilbert Bécaud, who had reached stardom more than a decade before Diamond, was also revered as a top performer and songwriter in France and other European countries. These two men came together in the late 1970s for a writing partnership that would ultimately produce about a dozen songs, including the first single from the Jazz Singer soundtrack – a song that would become one of the biggest recordings in Diamond’s career. On this episode of Documenting Popular Music, veteran journalist Robert Neil spotlights the remarkable songwriting collaboration and offers details about the Diamond/Bécaud partnership that have not been highlighted before. For this ‘Throwback Thursday’ (TBT) episode of Documenting Popular Music, we are replaying our 2015 review of James Taylor’s ‘Before this World album.

In 2017, he was dismissed from his job as a cleaner because he could not produce a British passport, rendering him destitute. Bristol collapsed and died on 31 March 2018 at the age of 57. His mother directly attributed his death to his struggle with the Home Office regarding his immigration status. His treatment and death was described by his MP David Lammy as \"a tragedy\".

He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Early life and education \nMedawar was born in Petrópolis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon, and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling). He had a brother Philip and a sister Pamela. (Pamela was later married to Sir David Hunt, who served as Private Secretary to prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.) His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. (He later described his father's profession as selling \"false teeth in South America\".) His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said, \"My birth was registered at the British Consulate in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born British subject'.\" Medawar left Brazil with his family for England \"towards the end of the war\", and he lived there for the rest of his life. He was also a Brazilian citizen by birth, as dictated by the Brazilian nationality law (jus soli). At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and he had to renounce his Brazilian citizenship. In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire. An experience of bullying and racism made him feel the rest of his life \"resentful and disgusted at the manners and mores of [Marlborough's] essentially tribal institution,\" and likened it to the training schools for the Nazi SS as all \"founded upon the twin pillars of sex and sadism.\" In 1932, he went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in 1935. Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior demy of Magdalen in 1935. In 1938, he became Fellow of Magdalen through an examination, the position he held till 1944. The University of Oxford approved his Doctor of Philosophy thesis titled \"Growth promoting and growth inhibiting factors in normal and abnormal development\" in 1941, but because of the prohibitive cost of supplication (the process by which the degree is officially conferred), he spent the money on his urgent appendectomy instead. The University of Oxford later awarded him a Doctor of Science degree in 1947. His predecessor Sir Charles Harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was, as he described, \"[N]o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a Rolls-Royce\". He was head of the transplantation section of the Medical Research Council's clinical research centre at Harrow from 1971 to 1986.

It directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans, specifically kidney transplantation, carried out by an American physician Joseph Murray, who eventually received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor on 27 February 1937. They met while in graduate class at Oxford, he at Magdalen and Taylor at Somerville College. Medawar described her as \"the most beautiful woman in Oxford\"; but Taylor's impression was he looked \"mildly diabolical.\" Taylor's family objected to their marriage as Medawar had \"no background, and no money.\" Medawar was interested in a wide range of subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket. He was exceptionally tall, 6 ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. As he completed his PhD research in 1941, he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the requisite £25, to which he commented:\n\nI'm an impostor. Medawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director Alex Garland. He even asked his wife \"to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [their] children.\" Nonetheless, he also said the following, which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate, it does not help them all equally:\n\nLater life and death \nIn 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster's annual Reith Lectures—following in the footsteps of his colleague, J. While attending the annual British Association meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at Exeter Cathedral, a duty which falls on every new President of the British Association. It was, as he said, \"monstrous bad luck because Jim Whyte Black had not yet devised beta-blockers, which slow the heart-beat and could have preserved my health and my career\". After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, more haemorrhages followed and in 1987 he died in the Royal Free Hospital, London. He is interred with his wife Jean (1913–2005) in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church in Alfriston in East Sussex.

He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Early life and education \nMedawar was born in Petrópolis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon, and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling). He had a brother Philip and a sister Pamela. (Pamela was later married to Sir David Hunt, who served as Private Secretary to prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.) His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. (He later described his father's profession as selling \"false teeth in South America\".) His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said, \"My birth was registered at the British Consulate in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born British subject'.\" Medawar left Brazil with his family for England \"towards the end of the war\", and he lived there for the rest of his life. He was also a Brazilian citizen by birth, as dictated by the Brazilian nationality law (jus soli). At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and he had to renounce his Brazilian citizenship. In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire. An experience of bullying and racism made him feel the rest of his life \"resentful and disgusted at the manners and mores of [Marlborough's] essentially tribal institution,\" and likened it to the training schools for the Nazi SS as all \"founded upon the twin pillars of sex and sadism.\" In 1932, he went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in 1935. Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior demy of Magdalen in 1935. In 1938, he became Fellow of Magdalen through an examination, the position he held till 1944. The University of Oxford approved his Doctor of Philosophy thesis titled \"Growth promoting and growth inhibiting factors in normal and abnormal development\" in 1941, but because of the prohibitive cost of supplication (the process by which the degree is officially conferred), he spent the money on his urgent appendectomy instead. The University of Oxford later awarded him a Doctor of Science degree in 1947. His predecessor Sir Charles Harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was, as he described, \"[N]o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a Rolls-Royce\". He was head of the transplantation section of the Medical Research Council's clinical research centre at Harrow from 1971 to 1986.

He was exceptionally tall, 6 ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures.

Due to NIAA rules which require a transfer student to wait a year before participating in athletic activities, Randall II was required to sit out his sophomore year in both football and track and field at Bishop Gorman. He is the son of retired National Football League quarterback Randall Cunningham, nephew of retired NFL fullback Sam Cunningham and older brother of World Champion Vashti Cunningham. Subsequently, Cunningham led Gorman through \n\n undefeated Southwest League regular season, marking the seventh consecutive such occurrence for the school. By mid-November, Cunningham stated \"I like USC, UCLA, Kansas State, Texas, ASU, and Indiana - and Oregon as well\". Cunningham was briefly recruited by Clay Helton, USC quarterback coach under Steve Sarkisian, but USC did not make him a football scholarship offer.

As with The Memory Cathedral, the novel includes encounters with a number of other iconic figures of the period, including Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedy family and Elvis Presley. This novel is published by HarperCollins Flamingo in Australia and Morrow in the U.S. Locus wrote: \"The Rebel is a significant and very gripping novel, a welcome addition to Jack Dann's growing oeuvre of speculative historical novels, sustaining further his long-standing contemplation of the modalities of myth and memory. Rogers had a minor career as an actor and was most noted for playing his father (whom he closely resembled), particularly in The Story of Will Rogers (1952), Wild Heritage (1958) in which he played a judge, and in 1982 (in voice only) in The American Adventure at Disney's Epcot in Florida. Earlier, in 1953-1954, he starred too in Rogers of the Gazette, a CBS Radio series that lasted one season, playing the role of a small-town newspaper owner. Also for one season, in 1956, he hosted The Morning Show on CBS Television but was replaced by Jimmy Dean. He was one of several actors as well to host syndicated reruns of the television anthology series Death Valley Days, with the episodes he hosted airing under the title The Pioneers. The series was the result of the success of the pilot, the episode \"Jamie\" of ABC Album/Plymouth Playhouse. It was broadcast on April 26, 1953. The pilot cast would return for the series, except that of Eva Marie Saint who would be replaced by Kathleen Nolan. The star of the show was 11-year-old Brandon deWilde, whose rising fame had catapulted him to national prominence in a period of three years. He then received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his 1953 portrayal of the young Joey Starrett in George Stevens' film Shane, his most memorable role. The series, which is billed as \"The Year of the Paramedic\", begins with a motorway collision stunt sequence, and features a crossover episode with spin-off series, Holby City. Amanda Mealing appears as clinical lead and consultant in emergency medicine Connie Beauchamp, while William Beck, George Rainsford and Jaye Griffiths portray consultants Dylan Keogh, Ethan Hardy, and Elle Gardner respectively. Charles Venn portrays senior staff nurse Jacob Masters, while Azuka Oforka features as staff nurse Louise Tyler, who is later promoted to senior staff nurse. Tony Marshall stars as receptionist Noel Garcia. Additionally, four cast members feature on the series in a recurring capacity: Rebecca Ryan features as porter Gemma Dean; Kai Thorne portrays Blake Gardner; Joe Gaminara appears as F1 doctor Eddie McAllister; and Di Botcher plays operational duty manager and paramedic Jan Jenning. In the opening episode of the series, Sam is killed off after succumbing to injuries sustained in a motorway collision. She was glad that her departure was kept hidden and felt it had a greater impact. Alicia departs in episode 20. Connie departs in the season finale at the conclusion of her story about posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. On 1 August 2018, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy reported that former EastEnders actor Shaheen Jafargholi had joined the cast as new nurse, Marty Kirkby. Series producer Lucy Raffety revealed on 15 August 2018 that actress Gabriella Leon would join the show alongside Jafargholi, playing student nurse Jade Lovall. Genesis Lynea and Jack Nolan were later cast as registrars Archie Hudson and Will Noble. Raffety announced on 31 May 2019 that Jacey Sallés would join the cast as porter Rosa Cadenas during the series and feature in an \"interesting story\" with David. In February 2019, it was confirmed that Thomas had reprised the role for another stint exploring Jacob's backstory, and she appears between episode 36 and 41, where the character was killed off. Episode one features the first appearance of Max Parker as Alasdair \"Base\" Newman, a drug addict who Iain befriends. Base's drug dealer, Ross West (Chris Gordon), also appears in the series across five episodes between episode 5 and episode 22. In his final episode, Ross is revealed to be Jan's son. The same storyline also sees the reappearance of DC Kate Wilkinson (Amy Noble) in episode 22, a character who has appeared on-off since series 30. Gyuri Sarossy is later introduced as Ciara's husband, Joel Dunns, in episode 5. Both characters depart in episode 14. The character, billed as a \"dishy doctor\", returns from episode 15 as a love interest for Marty, but leaves in episode 20. Actor Paul Barber joined the recurring cast in episode 13 as Ernest Maxwell, a homeless man involved in a storyline with Louise. The character is killed-off in episode 23 as the storyline continues, emotionally impacting Louise.

The season takes place largely in the Earth Kingdom, one of the four major nations in the setting of the series, while depicting the re-emergence of airbending among people of other nations. The season's antagonists are the \"Red Lotus\", a group of dangerous anarchists led by the new airbender Zaheer who wants to overthrow the world's governments and the Avatar. Writing for The Escapist, Mike Hoffman noted how the series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing, but also giving emotional weight to the death of major characters, including \"one of the most brutal and sudden deaths in children's television\" in the case of P'Li in season 3.

The season's antagonists are the \"Red Lotus\", a group of dangerous anarchists led by the new airbender Zaheer who wants to overthrow the world's governments and the Avatar.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the European Heart Journal. Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes. China\n\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997, and 1999. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant.

The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the European Heart Journal. Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes. China\n\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997, and 1999. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. On 3 December 2018, GSK announced that Unilever would acquire the Indian-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare business for US$3.8billion (£2.98billion). Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955.

In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the European Heart Journal. Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes. China\n\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997, and 1999. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985.

Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the European Heart Journal. Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes. China\n\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997, and 1999. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. On 3 December 2018, GSK announced that Unilever would acquire the Indian-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare business for US$3.8billion (£2.98billion). Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares).

The strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central pressure, was Typhoon Tip, which reached a pressure of 870 hPa (25.69 inHg) on October 12, 1979. Typhoon Tip is considered to be both the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the world, with a minimum pressure of 870 mbar, as well as the largest ever recorded, with a diameter of more than 2,000 km (>1,250 mi). The cyclone formed on October 5, and after moving into a very favorable environment for development, quickly strengthened into Super Typhoon Tip on the 11th. Tip weakened to a Category 1 typhoon before making landfall in Japan, killing nearly 100 people. ; Typhoon Tip (1983) (T8302, 02W, Auring) – Formed near the Philippines and hit China as a tropical storm, causing minor damage. ; Typhoon Tip (1986) (T8612, 10W) – A Category 1 typhoon that remained well at sea. In 1901, 21 tropical cyclones were observed in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them.

The cyclone formed on October 5, and after moving into a very favorable environment for development, quickly strengthened into Super Typhoon Tip on the 11th. Tip weakened to a Category 1 typhoon before making landfall in Japan, killing nearly 100 people. ; Typhoon Tip (1983) (T8302, 02W, Auring) – Formed near the Philippines and hit China as a tropical storm, causing minor damage. ; Typhoon Tip (1986) (T8612, 10W) – A Category 1 typhoon that remained well at sea. In 1901, 21 tropical cyclones were observed in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them. The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar, before striking eastern China.\n\n"

Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against Tecumseh's Confederacy; the US gained victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811. After Harrison destroyed Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh joined forces with the British in Upper Canada at the outset of the War of 1812. Despite their overall stance as allies for the Americans, a handful of Arapaho warriors fought against the United States in key battles during the war. Like in previous wars, the US recruited Indian warriors from tribes that were enemies with the Arapaho–Cheyenne–Lakota–Dakota alliance to act as Indian scouts, most notably from the Crow, Arikara, and Shoshone. In 1800, William Henry Harrison became governor of the Indiana Territory, under the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, and he pursued an aggressive policy of obtaining titles to Indian lands. Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa organized Tecumseh's War, another pan-tribal resistance to westward settlement. Tecumseh was in the South attempting to recruit allies among the Creeks, Cherokees, and Choctaws when Harrison marched against the Indian confederacy, defeating Tenskwatawa and his followers at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. The Americans hoped that the victory would end the militant resistance, but Tecumseh instead chose to ally openly with the British, who were soon at war with the Americans in the War of 1812. Tecumseh's confederacy was a confederation of native Americans in the Great Lakes region of the United States that began to form in the early 19th century around the teaching of Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of The Prophet, developed into the leader of the group as early as 1808. Together, they worked to unite the various tribes against the European settlers coming across the Appalachian Mountains and onto their land. In November 1811, an American military force under the leadership of William Henry Harrison engaged warriors associated with Tenskwatawa in the Battle of Tippecanoe.\n\nQuestion: In what century did this Native warrior and chief, whose brother Tenskwatawa led the Tippecanoe order of battle, become the primary leader of a large, multi tribal confederacy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Toronto International Film Festival critics have ranked it among the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as \"unnerving but also enthralling\".

It was invented by British hairdresser and amateur chemist Maurice Ward (1933–2011) during the 1970s and 1980s, and received significant publicity after coverage of the material aired in 1990 on the BBC science and technology show Tomorrow's World. The name Starlite was coined by Ward's granddaughter Kimberly. The American company Thermashield, LLC claims to have acquired the rights to Starlite in 2013 and replicated it. Thermashield's Starlite has successfully passed femtosecond laser testing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and ASTM D635-15 Standard Testing. In comparison, the bullet-resistant fiber Kevlar fails at 27–33 J/g. Synthetic muscles offer high contraction/extension ratio given an electric current. SWNT are in use as an experimental material for removable, structural bridge panels. In 2015, researchers incorporated CNTs and graphene into spider silk, increasing its strength and toughness to a new record. The resulting silk had a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a Young’s modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa, surpassing both synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kevlar49) and knotted fibers. Soft Template Manufacturing of Nanomaterials, U.S. Patent 20130149500A1 with A. Bernal, 2011 \n\nOne embodiment of a spinal spacer (10) includes a body (11) sized and configured for engagement between adjacent vertebrae (V). Also provided is a plurality of apertures (16) through the sleeve (15) in communication with the outer surface (13) of the body (11) for bone ingrowth. Specifically, the invention concerns a reinforced bone graft substitute. U.S. Patent No. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,044,104; 5,026,373 and 4,961,740 to Ray; 5,015,247 to Michelson and U.S. Patent No. teach hollow metal cage structures. Surface porosity in such solid implants does not correct this problem because it will not allow sufficient ingrowth to provide a solid bone mass strong enough to withstand the loads of the spine. On the other hand, the hollow cage structures of Harms, Ray and Michelson allow ingrowth. Unfortunately, many of these devices are difficult to machine and therefore expensive. The supply of allograft material, which is obtained from donors of the same species, is not limited. However, allografts are also disadvantageous because of the risk of disease transmission and immune reactions. Furthermore, allogenic bone does not have the osteogenic potential of autogenous bone and therefore will give only temporary support. Calcium phosphate ceramics are biocompatible and do not present the infectious or immunological concerns of allograft materials. Ceramics may be prepared in any quantity which is a great advantage over autograft bone graft material. Furthermore, bioceramics are osteoconductive, stimulating osteogenesis in boney sites, and are also thought to be osteogenic, able to initiate osteogenesis in non-boney sites. Bioceramics provide a porous matrix which further encourages new bone growth. Unfortunately, ceramic implants lack the strength to support high spinal loads and therefore require separate fixation before the fusion. One attempt in overcoming the poor compressive strength of bioceramics is disclosed in International Publication No. WO 96/40014. Of the calcium phosphate ceramics, hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate ceramics have been most commonly used for bone grafting. Hydroxyapatite is chemically similar to inorganic bone substance and biocompatible with bone. The body includes a porous biocompatible material for permitting tissue ingrowth therethrough. In one specific embodiment of the invention, there is provided a plurality of apertures through the sleeve in communication with the outer surface of the body for bone ingrowth. This embodiment is advantageous because it combines the natural mineral structure of bone with the osteoinductive power of a bone growth protein in a load bearing spacer. An additional benefit is that the invention provides a stable scaffold for bone ingrowth before fusion occurs. Other objects and further benefits of the present invention will become apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art from the following written description and accompanying Figures. FIG. FIG. FIG. FIGS. FIG. Porosity of the biocompatible material is required for ingrowth, but it is generally understood that as porosity increases, strength decreases. The biocompatible materials of this invention preferably include porosities of between about 40% and about 60%, with a 50% porosity being most preferred. Therefore, the ceramics of the present invention are contemplated to have a mean pore size of about 200 to about 700 microns. Referring again to FIGS. The metal material includes any surgically suitable metal including titanium, titanium-vanadium-aluminum alloy, cobalt-chromium alloy, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy, cobalt-nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy, biocompatible stainless steel, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, tungsten and alloys thereof. Preferably, the metal is 316 LVM stainless steel, titanium or tantalum foam. Most preferably, the metal material is an open-cell tantalum foam as described in U.S. Patent No. This material is a carbon-metal composite including a skeleton of vitreous carbon defining a network of interconnecting pores which are infiltrated with tantalum or another suitable metal by chemical vapor deposition. This material is advantageous because it provides the strength of other metals to serve as a scaffold and prosthesis but also mimics the structure of bone. The interconnecting pores of the foam serve as another site for bone ingrowth. According to the present invention, a disc of tantalum foam can be prepared according to the Kaplan patent. The center of the tantalum foam disc can then be drilled out to obtain a metal foam sleeve. Referring to FIG. In other words, the sleeve 15 can be expanded by the application of heat and then shrunk around the body 11 by cooling. For example, when the body is cylindrical, the sleeve is a hollow cylinder as shown in FIGS. Any suitable shape is contemplated for the apertures. As shown in FIGS. 6-11, the apertures may be generally circular, oval, diamond shaped or rectangular. In one specific embodiment depicted in FIG. As shown in FIG. In a preferred embodiment, the body 11 of the spacer 10 is shaped from bone. It is contemplated that any suitable bone material may be used. For example, the bone grafts of copending application, USSN 08/740,031 filed October 23, 1996 (corresponding to WO 98/17209, filed October 21, 1997) can be combined with the reinforcement sleeve of the present invention to provide a reinforced bone graft having a high compressive strength. 5,417,975 to Lussi et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,314,380 to Miyata et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,573,771 to Geistlich et al., U.S. Patent No. 110, April 1975 and \"Xenogeneic Bone Grafting in Humans by Salama, in Xenogeneic Bone Grafting, Number 174, April 1983. In such cases, it is important to add collagen, gelatin or a similar protein or composition to provide the correct consistency.

It was invented by British hairdresser and amateur chemist Maurice Ward (1933–2011) during the 1970s and 1980s, and received significant publicity after coverage of the material aired in 1990 on the BBC science and technology show Tomorrow's World. The name Starlite was coined by Ward's granddaughter Kimberly. The American company Thermashield, LLC claims to have acquired the rights to Starlite in 2013 and replicated it. Thermashield's Starlite has successfully passed femtosecond laser testing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and ASTM D635-15 Standard Testing. In comparison, the bullet-resistant fiber Kevlar fails at 27–33 J/g. Synthetic muscles offer high contraction/extension ratio given an electric current. SWNT are in use as an experimental material for removable, structural bridge panels. In 2015, researchers incorporated CNTs and graphene into spider silk, increasing its strength and toughness to a new record. The resulting silk had a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a Young’s modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa, surpassing both synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kevlar49) and knotted fibers. Soft Template Manufacturing of Nanomaterials, U.S. Patent 20130149500A1 with A. Bernal, 2011 \n\nOne embodiment of a spinal spacer (10) includes a body (11) sized and configured for engagement between adjacent vertebrae (V). Also provided is a plurality of apertures (16) through the sleeve (15) in communication with the outer surface (13) of the body (11) for bone ingrowth. Specifically, the invention concerns a reinforced bone graft substitute. U.S. Patent No. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,044,104; 5,026,373 and 4,961,740 to Ray; 5,015,247 to Michelson and U.S. Patent No. teach hollow metal cage structures. Surface porosity in such solid implants does not correct this problem because it will not allow sufficient ingrowth to provide a solid bone mass strong enough to withstand the loads of the spine. On the other hand, the hollow cage structures of Harms, Ray and Michelson allow ingrowth. Unfortunately, many of these devices are difficult to machine and therefore expensive. The supply of allograft material, which is obtained from donors of the same species, is not limited. However, allografts are also disadvantageous because of the risk of disease transmission and immune reactions. Furthermore, allogenic bone does not have the osteogenic potential of autogenous bone and therefore will give only temporary support. Calcium phosphate ceramics are biocompatible and do not present the infectious or immunological concerns of allograft materials. Ceramics may be prepared in any quantity which is a great advantage over autograft bone graft material. Furthermore, bioceramics are osteoconductive, stimulating osteogenesis in boney sites, and are also thought to be osteogenic, able to initiate osteogenesis in non-boney sites. Bioceramics provide a porous matrix which further encourages new bone growth. Unfortunately, ceramic implants lack the strength to support high spinal loads and therefore require separate fixation before the fusion. One attempt in overcoming the poor compressive strength of bioceramics is disclosed in International Publication No. WO 96/40014. Of the calcium phosphate ceramics, hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate ceramics have been most commonly used for bone grafting. Hydroxyapatite is chemically similar to inorganic bone substance and biocompatible with bone. The body includes a porous biocompatible material for permitting tissue ingrowth therethrough. In one specific embodiment of the invention, there is provided a plurality of apertures through the sleeve in communication with the outer surface of the body for bone ingrowth. This embodiment is advantageous because it combines the natural mineral structure of bone with the osteoinductive power of a bone growth protein in a load bearing spacer. An additional benefit is that the invention provides a stable scaffold for bone ingrowth before fusion occurs. Other objects and further benefits of the present invention will become apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art from the following written description and accompanying Figures. FIG. FIG. FIG. FIGS. FIG. Porosity of the biocompatible material is required for ingrowth, but it is generally understood that as porosity increases, strength decreases. The biocompatible materials of this invention preferably include porosities of between about 40% and about 60%, with a 50% porosity being most preferred. Therefore, the ceramics of the present invention are contemplated to have a mean pore size of about 200 to about 700 microns. Referring again to FIGS. The metal material includes any surgically suitable metal including titanium, titanium-vanadium-aluminum alloy, cobalt-chromium alloy, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy, cobalt-nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy, biocompatible stainless steel, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, tungsten and alloys thereof. Preferably, the metal is 316 LVM stainless steel, titanium or tantalum foam. Most preferably, the metal material is an open-cell tantalum foam as described in U.S. Patent No. This material is a carbon-metal composite including a skeleton of vitreous carbon defining a network of interconnecting pores which are infiltrated with tantalum or another suitable metal by chemical vapor deposition. This material is advantageous because it provides the strength of other metals to serve as a scaffold and prosthesis but also mimics the structure of bone. The interconnecting pores of the foam serve as another site for bone ingrowth. According to the present invention, a disc of tantalum foam can be prepared according to the Kaplan patent. The center of the tantalum foam disc can then be drilled out to obtain a metal foam sleeve. Referring to FIG. In other words, the sleeve 15 can be expanded by the application of heat and then shrunk around the body 11 by cooling. For example, when the body is cylindrical, the sleeve is a hollow cylinder as shown in FIGS. Any suitable shape is contemplated for the apertures.

The Admiral Theatre, a restored 1942 Art Deco theater, is Bremerton's most prominent venue for live music and entertainment.\n\n"

Smith was accused by multiple women, including some he married, of romance scams. He is accused of being married at least ten times and to more than one woman at a time, and being accused of using multiple identities. His former partners accused him of using their identities to make purchases and obtain credit, leaving them severely in debt. After one former partner went to the police in 2017, he pleaded guilty to identity theft and received a 10 month jail sentence, later violating probation. The women each tell their stories of how they met Smith and came to be duped, and the film explores what led Smith to act in these ways. Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.

With their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly.

Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. \", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. A second dream scene was also shot which featured a parasitic twin emerging from Beverly's stomach but this sequence was not used in the final cut. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing \"it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid\", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it \"every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller\", adding it was \"like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious\". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" See also\n Look-alike\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n Dead Ringers an essay by Chris Rodley at the Criterion Collection\n\n1988 films\n1988 horror films\n\n1980s psychological thriller films\n1980s thriller drama films\n20th Century Fox films\nAmerican films\nAmerican horror thriller films\nAmerican psychological drama films\nAmerican psychological horror films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nAmerican thriller drama films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian psychological drama films\nCanadian films\nCanadian horror thriller films\nCanadian psychological thriller films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nEnglish-language films\nFilms about sexuality\nFilms about twin brothers\nFilms directed by David Cronenberg\nFilms scored by Howard Shore\nFilms set in Toronto\nFilms shot in Toronto\nAmerican horror drama films\nBest Picture Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners\nGynaecology\nMedical-themed films\nMorgan Creek Productions films\n1988 drama films\n\n Slasher himself, informing Homes that he has escaped from prison, and plans to resume \"slashing\" innocent citizens.

Prohormones are substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body, providing similar benefits to taking anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) without the legal risks associated with them. They are often used to enhance muscle growth, increase strength and power, improve athletic performance, and accelerate recovery from intense training or injuries. These compounds are believed to undergo enzymatic changes within the body, converting into active hormones that interact with androgen receptors to produce anabolic effects. By mimicking the actions of AAS, prohormones aim to enhance muscle protein synthesis, promote nitrogen retention, and inhibit muscle breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and improved physical performance. One of the advantages of using prohormones for bodybuilders and athletes is the legal aspect. The Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 established regulatory control over AAS and certain androgen prohormones, categorizing them as controlled substances. It is crucial to consult with medical professionals or experts in sports medicine before considering the use of prohormones or any performance-enhancing substances. Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

Anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), including testosterone and its esters, have also been taken to enhance muscle development, strength, or endurance. After a series of scandals and publicity in the 1980s (such as Ben Johnson's improved performance at the 1988 Summer Olympics), prohibitions of AAS use were renewed or strengthened by many sports organizations. Testosterone and \n\nAnabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

They increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

        "prediction": "anabolic steroids",
        "gold": "Anabolic steroids",
        "context": "Bodybuilders and athletes may use prohormones for several reasons. Prohormones are substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body, providing similar benefits to taking anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) without the legal risks associated with them. They are often used to enhance muscle growth, increase strength and power, improve athletic performance, and accelerate recovery from intense training or injuries. These compounds are believed to undergo enzymatic changes within the body, converting into active hormones that interact with androgen receptors to produce anabolic effects. By mimicking the actions of AAS, prohormones aim to enhance muscle protein synthesis, promote nitrogen retention, and inhibit muscle breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and improved physical performance. One of the advantages of using prohormones for bodybuilders and athletes is the legal aspect. The Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 established regulatory control over AAS and certain androgen prohormones, categorizing them as controlled substances. It is crucial to consult with medical professionals or experts in sports medicine before considering the use of prohormones or any performance-enhancing substances. Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

Anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), including testosterone and its esters, have also been taken to enhance muscle development, strength, or endurance. After a series of scandals and publicity in the 1980s (such as Ben Johnson's improved performance at the 1988 Summer Olympics), prohibitions of AAS use were renewed or strengthened by many sports organizations. Testosterone and \n\nAnabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

They increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of facial and body hair. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

It also serves as regional capital of Oromia. According to the 2007 census, the city's population is estimated at 2,739,551 inhabitants. A highly developed and important cultural, artistic and financial centre, Addis Ababa is a chartered city. Emperor Menelik II founded the city in 1886 en route to conquering the remains of kingdoms, eventually establishing the modern border of Ethiopia. Following Italy's defeat at the Battle of Adwa, Addis Ababa became permanent capital of the Ethiopian Empire in 1889; international embassies opened and saw rapid urbanization. Several institutions such as the house of the prime minister, Ministry of Peace, headquarters of the Ethiopian National Defense Force and federal police, as well as national intelligence agencies INSA and the NISS, are located in the city. In addition, it is the seat \n\n Al-Assad National Library (مَكْتَبَةُ الْأَسَدِ الْوَطَنِيَّةِ) is the national library of Syria, located in the capital Damascus overlooking the Umayyad Square. It's named after Hafez al-Assad. In 1976, Syria's Ministry of Culture issued an official decision to build a national library. The library's purpose was \"to gather all books and daily issues in addition to all kinds of literature connected with our ancestral cultural legacy\", then to sort out these materials to serve researchers and scholars and benefit them. It is the legal deposit and copyright for Syria. The Libraries and Documents Association of Syria has its headquarters at the Assad National Library. As literacy and socioeconomic status improves in Ethiopia, the demand for quality service is also increasing. Introduction\nEthiopia is one of the fastest growing countries in Africa, having more than 104 million people (the second most-populous in the region). It experiences the public health problems typical of an underdeveloped country, such as communicable diseases (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis etc), maternal and child health problems (diarrhoea & dehydration, pneumonia, neonatal problems etc) and malnutrition; these account for the majority of public health problems. History\n \nIn Ethiopia, the quest for modern medicine beyond traditional practice started during Emperor Lebnedingil’s reign in the 15th century, when the emperor appealed to the Portuguese king for physicians and surgeons to cure illnesses. Later in 1866, western medicine was introduced by Swedish missioner doctors and Nurses. The first Ethiopian hospital was established in 1897, the Ministry of Health in 1948 and the first medical school in the country opened in 1964. It was only during Emperor Menelik’s time (1889-1913) that the first foreign-trained Ethiopian medical doctor, Hakim Workneh Eshete, began practicing medicine in Addis Ababa. Statistics:\n\nHealth care financing\nThe current Ethiopia health care financing strategy focus on financing of primary health care services in a sustainable manner. According to the 6th National Health Accounts (2013/14), health service in Ethiopia is primarily financed from 4 sources: the federal and regional governments; grants and loans from bilateral and multilateral donors; non-governmental organizations and private contributions. The main purchasers of health service in Ethiopia are: the Ministry of Health; Regional Health Bureaus; District/Woreda Health Offices in the form of line-item budgets; Ethiopia Health Insurance Agency; and, other government entities that transfer budget to service providers to reimburse service delivery cost; and households in the form of user fee. History of development \n\nThroughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrolments, adult literacy, and infant mortality rates. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea, but since outlays for health have grown steadily. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. Its major themes focussed on: \nDemocratization and decentralization of health system; \nExpanding the primary health care system and emphasizing preventive, promotional, and basic curative health services; and \nEncouraging partnerships and the participation of the community and nongovernmental actors. In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. This included placing two government-salaried female Health Extension Workers in every kebele, with the aim of shifting the emphasis of health care to prevention. However, these trainees encountered a lack of adequate facilities, including classrooms, libraries, water, and latrines. In January 2005, the government began distributing antiretroviral drugs, hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults. According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, in 2007 Ethiopia had only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people. However, the World Health Organization in its 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1936 physicians (for 2003), which is about 2.6 per 100,000. There were 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia in 2005. Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for a better economic opportunity in better-developed countries. Ethiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years in 2012. Rates of immunization are less than 3% of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20% in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70% of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43%in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas were three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas in 2008. The HEP was launched in the four big agrarian regions, expanded to the remaining regions in subsequent years. It was planned to cover all rural kebeles with the aim of achieving universal primary health care coverage by 2008. Services are organized along geographic lines with construction of a comprehensive network of primary health care units throughout the country with one health post in every rural kebele of 5000 people linked to a referral health center. An implementation Manual for Pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas was finalized and distributed to respective regions. In order to expand the Urban Health Extension program in seven regions of the country, 15 packages along with implementation manual were developed and distributed for implementation in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Harari, Dire Dawa, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has achieved most health related Millennium Development Goals. Addressing equity and quality of health services are the main focuses of the new Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan. Considering the varied nature of the community residing in the pastoralist and developing regions, the Ministry of Health, along with the Regional Health Bureaus is committed to developing a unique strategy to address pastoralist communities' health issues. Health facility construction and expansion\nMajor activities under the health facility construction, expansion, rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping focused mainly on the Primary Healthcare facilities:  the number of public Health Centres increased from 412 in 1996/97 to 519 in 2003/04. There has been also considerable health facility rehabilitation program and furnishing. By 2008/09 there were 111 Public Hospitals. Midwifery teaching institutions increased from 23 to 49. If the current pace is sustained, Ethiopia will be able to meet the minimum threshold of health professionals to population ratio of 2.3 per 1000 population, the 2025 benchmark set by the World Health Organization (WHO), for Sub-Saharan Africa. As shown in the table above, this is the source of health financing that can be seen in Ethiopia, which explains that the donors, households(oop)  and Government have almost equal expenditure.

Introduction\nEthiopia is one of the fastest growing countries in Africa, having more than 104 million people (the second most-populous in the region). It experiences the public health problems typical of an underdeveloped country, such as communicable diseases (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis etc), maternal and child health problems (diarrhoea & dehydration, pneumonia, neonatal problems etc) and malnutrition; these account for the majority of public health problems. History\n \nIn Ethiopia, the quest for modern medicine beyond traditional practice started during Emperor Lebnedingil’s reign in the 15th century, when the emperor appealed to the Portuguese king for physicians and surgeons to cure illnesses. Later in 1866, western medicine was introduced by Swedish missioner doctors and Nurses. The first Ethiopian hospital was established in 1897, the Ministry of Health in 1948 and the first medical school in the country opened in 1964. It was only during Emperor Menelik’s time (1889-1913) that the first foreign-trained Ethiopian medical doctor, Hakim Workneh Eshete, began practicing medicine in Addis Ababa. Statistics:\n\nHealth care financing\nThe current Ethiopia health care financing strategy focus on financing of primary health care services in a sustainable manner. According to the 6th National Health Accounts (2013/14), health service in Ethiopia is primarily financed from 4 sources: the federal and regional governments; grants and loans from bilateral and multilateral donors; non-governmental organizations and private contributions. The main purchasers of health service in Ethiopia are: the Ministry of Health; Regional Health Bureaus; District/Woreda Health Offices in the form of line-item budgets; Ethiopia Health Insurance Agency; and, other government entities that transfer budget to service providers to reimburse service delivery cost; and households in the form of user fee. History of development \n\nThroughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrolments, adult literacy, and infant mortality rates. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea, but since outlays for health have grown steadily. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. Its major themes focussed on: \nDemocratization and decentralization of health system; \nExpanding the primary health care system and emphasizing preventive, promotional, and basic curative health services; and \nEncouraging partnerships and the participation of the community and nongovernmental actors. In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. This included placing two government-salaried female Health Extension Workers in every kebele, with the aim of shifting the emphasis of health care to prevention. However, these trainees encountered a lack of adequate facilities, including classrooms, libraries, water, and latrines. In January 2005, the government began distributing antiretroviral drugs, hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults. According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, in 2007 Ethiopia had only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people. However, the World Health Organization in its 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1936 physicians (for 2003), which is about 2.6 per 100,000. There were 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia in 2005. Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for a better economic opportunity in better-developed countries. Ethiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years in 2012. Rates of immunization are less than 3% of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20% in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70% of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43%in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas were three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas in 2008. The HEP was launched in the four big agrarian regions, expanded to the remaining regions in subsequent years. It was planned to cover all rural kebeles with the aim of achieving universal primary health care coverage by 2008. Services are organized along geographic lines with construction of a comprehensive network of primary health care units throughout the country with one health post in every rural kebele of 5000 people linked to a referral health center. An implementation Manual for Pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas was finalized and distributed to respective regions. In order to expand the Urban Health Extension program in seven regions of the country, 15 packages along with implementation manual were developed and distributed for implementation in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Harari, Dire Dawa, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has achieved most health related Millennium Development Goals. Addressing equity and quality of health services are the main focuses of the new Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan. Considering the varied nature of the community residing in the pastoralist and developing regions, the Ministry of Health, along with the Regional Health Bureaus is committed to developing a unique strategy to address pastoralist communities' health issues. Health facility construction and expansion\nMajor activities under the health facility construction, expansion, rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping focused mainly on the Primary Healthcare facilities:  the number of public Health Centres increased from 412 in 1996/97 to 519 in 2003/04. There has been also considerable health facility rehabilitation program and furnishing. By 2008/09 there were 111 Public Hospitals. Midwifery teaching institutions increased from 23 to 49. If the current pace is sustained, Ethiopia will be able to meet the minimum threshold of health professionals to population ratio of 2.3 per 1000 population, the 2025 benchmark set by the World Health Organization (WHO), for Sub-Saharan Africa. As shown in the table above, this is the source of health financing that can be seen in Ethiopia, which explains that the donors, households(oop)  and Government have almost equal expenditure. The SIH system doesn't include 85% poorest society of Ethiopian living in a rural area, so I have given attention to CBHI. Community-based Health Insurance Development \nPilot implementation initiated since 2011 in 13 districts in four big regions (Oromia, Amhara, Tigray and South nation and nationality).

The original problem was the exterior grazing problem and appeared in the 1748 edition of the English annual journal The Ladies' Diary: or, the Woman’s Almanack, designated as Question attributed to Upnorensis (an unknown historical figure), stated thus: Observing a horse tied to feed in a gentlemen’s park, with one end of a rope to his fore foot, \n\n  The Bilberry goat (Fiaghabhar na bhFraochán) is a breed of feral goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) which is believed to have lived in one herd on Bilberry Rock in Waterford City in the south of Ireland for hundreds of years. Locals believe they came over with the Huguenots from France over 300 years ago and have lived on Bilberry Rock ever since. The Angora goat (Ankara keçisi) is a breed of domestic goat that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia. This breed was first mentioned in the time of Moses, roughly in 1500 BC. The fleece taken from an Angora goat is called mohair.\n\n"

It aims to perpetuate and spread the traditional religion of the ancient Guanche people. It was founded by a group of Canarian devotees of the goddess Chaxiraxi. The Church of the Guanche People performed baptisms and weddings according to what they know of Guanche custom. On 2002, a wedding held in accordance with purported Guanche rites took place on the island of Tenerife—a practice not observed for several centuries since the Spanish domination of the archipelago. The Church of the Guanche People has its own liturgical calendar, which officially begins with the first celebration of Achu n Magek in 2001. According to this system, this is the year I of the Guanche New Age. The Church of the Guanche People is a modern pagan religious body representing Canarian Neopaganism. It contains life-sized scenes of Guanche culture, and recreations of paintings and petroglyphs from various parts of the islands.

Due to the University's safety regulations, however, the rational scientists (including Chris French, Michael Heap, Kevin McClure, Bob Morris, David Stretch, Tim Taylor, Richard Wiseman and Tony Youens ) had to drop \n\n to \"investigation of paranormal and fringe-science claims\", but the 2006 change recognized and ratified a wider purview for CSI and its magazine, Skeptical Inquirer, that includes \"new science related issues at the intersection of science and public concerns, while not ignoring [their] core topics\".\n\n"

Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini, two renowned Italian directors, had distinct life paths that led them to become influential figures in the history of cinema. Firstly, both Visconti and Fellini started their careers in the neorealist genre. In terms of their personalities and creative styles, both directors had a unique vision and storytelling approach. Furthermore, both Visconti and Fellini were politically and culturally involved in their work.

The play explores themes of isolation, loneliness, miscommunication as anathematization, social disparity and dehumanization in a materialistic world. Today, professional theatre companies can produce The Zoo Story either as a part of Edward Albee's at Home at the Zoo (originally titled Peter and Jerry), or as a standalone play. Its prequel, Homelife, written in 2004, however, can only be produced as a part of Edward Albee's at Home at the Zoo. Great American playwright Edward Albee mines the ins and outs of the dysfunctional family in his body of work, which includes Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Three Tall Women, and, most recently, The Goat. ; Edward Albee, 88, American playwright (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, A Delicate Balance, The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? ), Tony (1963, 2002) and Pulitzer Prize winner (1967, 1975, 1994). ; Teodoro González de \n\n give important insight into the budding playwright...

Homelife is written as the first act, with The Zoo Story as the second act, in a new play called Edward Albee's At Home at the Zoo (initially titled Peter & Jerry). Christopher Wallenberg wrote of The Zoo Story: \"Over the years, he'd [Albee] always had a nagging feeling that something was missing from the piece’s unsettling encounter between two very different men on a Central Park bench ...\" Albee said: \"The Zoo Story is a good play.\n\n"

Joseph Cornelius O'Rourke was born in Dorpat in 1772. According to the custom of his class, O'Rourke was immediately enrolled at birth in the Russian Imperial Guard. His father was Count Cornelius O'Rourke, who retired in 1788 with the rank of Major-General. He served under General Kutuzov in \n\nSantiago Ramón y Cajal (; 1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) was a Spanish neuroscientist, pathologist, and histologist specializing in neuroanatomy and the central nervous system. Biography\nSantiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 May 1852 in the town of Petilla de Aragón, Navarre, Spain. Over the summer of 1868, his father took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the University of Zaragoza, where his father worked as an anatomy teacher. To aid his recovery, Ramón y Cajal spent time in the spa-town Panticosa in the Pyrenees mountain range. Two years later, he became the director of the Zaragoza Museum, and he married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he had seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the University of Valencia. In 1899 he became director of the Instituto Nacional de Higiene – translated as National Institute of Hygiene , and in 1922 founder of the  – translated as the Laboratory of Biological Investigations , later renamed to the , or Cajal Institute. Political and religious views\nIn 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a Masonic lodge. John Brande Trend wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal \"was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion\". Discoveries and theories\n\nRamón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC). Distinctions\n\nRamón y Cajal received many prizes, distinctions, and societal memberships during his scientific career, including honorary doctorates in medicine from Cambridge University and Würzburg University and an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Clark University. Even before Ramón y Cajal's work, Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen established the contiguous nature of nerve cells in his study of certain marine life, which Ramón y Cajal failed to cite. In society and culture\nIn 1906 Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida painted Cajal's official portrait celebrating his Nobel Prize win. Cajal posed for a statue that was created by the sculptor Mariano Benlliure and was installed 1924 in the Paraninfo building at the School of Medicine of the University of Zaragoza. This full-body statue that stands 3 m (around 10 ft) high on a narrow pedestal and created by Lorenzo Domínguez, a Chilean medical student. 1982 a TV mini series was created in Spain titled Ramón y Cajal: Historia de una voluntad. In 2003, the first major exhibition of Cajal's scientific drawings opened in Madrid, Spain. The accompanying catalog titled Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-2003) Ciencia y Arte features numerous high quality reproductions of Cajal's drawings and photo essays on the restoration process. Exhibition curators and contributing authors to the catalog include:  Santiago Ramón y Cajal Junquera, Miguel Ángel Freire Mallo, Paloma Esteban Leal, Pablo García, Virginia G. Marin, Ma Cruz Osuna, Isabel Argerich Fernández, Paloma Calle, Marta C. Lopera, Ricardo Martínez, Pilar Sedano Espín, Eugenia Gimeno Pascual, Sonia Tortajada, and Juan Antonio Sáez Dégano. In 2007, sculptures of Severo Ochoa y Santiago Ramón y Cajal created Víctor Ochoa were unveiled at the Spain's CESIC (university research centre), Madrid, Spain. Santiago Ramón y Cajal Museum, Ayerbe, Huesca, Spain opened in 2013 and is located in Cajal's childhood home, where he lived with his family for ten years. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health Bethesda, MD, US, initiated an ongoing exhibition of original Ramón y Cajal drawings in its John Porter Neuroscience Research Center. Inspired by Cajal's original drawings, Kamen's and Hunter's artworks are thematically representative of Cajal's aesthetic and are on permanent display for the public at the John Porter Neuroscience Research Center. Through the award of a 2017-2018 Fulbright España Senior Research Fellowship to the Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain, Hunter continued to develop her creative project about Cajal by referencing original source material. Cajal's work was the centerpiece topic of the exhibition and the show explored the influence of histological drawings on Surrealism. The first symposium held at the NIH in 2015 was titled Bridging the Legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a symposium honoring the father of modern neuroscience. Keynote speaker Dr. Rafael Yuste was honored at a reception held at the Spanish Ambassador's, Ramón Gil-Casares, home. The Cajal Inventory consists of forty-five 11” x 14” drawings in which Hunter recreated in fine detail Cajal’s scientific drawings from primary source, and surreal portrait drawings of Cajal inspired by his photography. Every year more than two hundred four-year postdoctoral fellowships by the Ministry of Science of Spain are awarded to middle career scholars from different fields of knowledge are called \"Ayudas a contratos Ramon y Cajal\" to honor his memory. An exhibition called The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal travelled through North America, beginning 2017 in the US at the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota. During 2019, the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain opened an exhibition about Cajal titled Santiago Ramón y Cajal. From the 19th of November, 2020 through the 5th of December 2021, the National Museum of Natural Sciences, Madrid, Spain will be hosting an exhibition featuring Cajal's scientific drawings, photographs, scientific equipment and personal objects from the Legado Cajal, Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain. In 2020, over 75 volunteers collaborated as part of The Cajal Embroidery Project across 6 countries to create 81 intricate, exquisite hand-stitched panels of Ramón y Cajal's images, which were then curated and displayed by Edinburgh Neuroscience at the virtual FENS 2020 Forum, and showcased by The Lancet Neurology in their front covers in 2021. In 2017, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) recognised Cajal’s Legacy (which had been kept in a museum from 1945 to 1989) as a World Heritage treasure. Recognising that this cultural treasure deserves a dedicated museum, showcasing not only Cajal’s but also his disciples’ legacies, there has been a call for a dedicated museum to commemorate and celebrate Ramón y Cajal's discoveries and impact on neuroscience.

Joseph Cornelius O'Rourke was born in Dorpat in 1772. According to the custom of his class, O'Rourke was immediately enrolled at birth in the Russian Imperial Guard.

He served under General Kutuzov in \n\nSantiago Ramón y Cajal (; 1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) was a Spanish neuroscientist, pathologist, and histologist specializing in neuroanatomy and the central nervous system. Biography\nSantiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 May 1852 in the town of Petilla de Aragón, Navarre, Spain. Over the summer of 1868, his father took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the University of Zaragoza, where his father worked as an anatomy teacher. To aid his recovery, Ramón y Cajal spent time in the spa-town Panticosa in the Pyrenees mountain range. Two years later, he became the director of the Zaragoza Museum, and he married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he had seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the University of Valencia. In 1899 he became director of the Instituto Nacional de Higiene – translated as National Institute of Hygiene , and in 1922 founder of the  – translated as the Laboratory of Biological Investigations , later renamed to the , or Cajal Institute. Political and religious views\nIn 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a Masonic lodge. John Brande Trend wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal \"was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion\". Discoveries and theories\n\nRamón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC). Distinctions\n\nRamón y Cajal received many prizes, distinctions, and societal memberships during his scientific career, including honorary doctorates in medicine from Cambridge University and Würzburg University and an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Clark University. Even before Ramón y Cajal's work, Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen established the contiguous nature of nerve cells in his study of certain marine life, which Ramón y Cajal failed to cite. In society and culture\nIn 1906 Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida painted Cajal's official portrait celebrating his Nobel Prize win. Cajal posed for a statue that was created by the sculptor Mariano Benlliure and was installed 1924 in the Paraninfo building at the School of Medicine of the University of Zaragoza. This full-body statue that stands 3 m (around 10 ft) high on a narrow pedestal and created by Lorenzo Domínguez, a Chilean medical student. 1982 a TV mini series was created in Spain titled Ramón y Cajal: Historia de una voluntad. In 2003, the first major exhibition of Cajal's scientific drawings opened in Madrid, Spain. The accompanying catalog titled Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-2003) Ciencia y Arte features numerous high quality reproductions of Cajal's drawings and photo essays on the restoration process. Exhibition curators and contributing authors to the catalog include:  Santiago Ramón y Cajal Junquera, Miguel Ángel Freire Mallo, Paloma Esteban Leal, Pablo García, Virginia G. Marin, Ma Cruz Osuna, Isabel Argerich Fernández, Paloma Calle, Marta C. Lopera, Ricardo Martínez, Pilar Sedano Espín, Eugenia Gimeno Pascual, Sonia Tortajada, and Juan Antonio Sáez Dégano.

The film was a surprise commercial success and has received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics and audiences, and has been analyzed for its satirical depiction of gentrification, class warfare, and capitalism.\n\n"

The magazine is distinguished from other magazines by its unique 10½ x 10½ inch square format, with each cover often devoted to the work of an artist. John P.

The magazine is distinguished from other magazines by its unique 10½ x 10½ inch square format, with each cover often devoted to the work of an artist. John P.

The magazine features in-depth articles and reviews of contemporary art, as well as book reviews, columns on cinema and popular culture, personal essays, commissioned artworks and essays, and numerous full-page advertisements from prominent galleries around the world. The next publisher/owner Charles Cowles moved the magazine to Los Angeles in 1965 before finally settling it in New York City in 1967, where it maintains offices today. It evolved, in 1852, into The Illustrated Exhibitor and Magazine of Art, a weekly devoted to the arts, educational in purpose and offering \"culture for the little cultured\".

It is the fourth theatrical film in The Muppets franchise, and the first to be produced following the deaths of the Muppets creator Jim Henson and the performer Richard Hunt; the film is dedicated to both. It is the first Muppets film to be produced by Walt Disney Pictures, whose parent company would later acquire the Muppets franchise in 2004. A Christmas Carol is a 1997 American animated musical film version of the 1843 novella of the same name by Charles Dickens produced by DIC Productions, L.P. and distributed by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. It features eight original songs and stars the voice talents of Tim Curry, Whoopi Goldberg, Ed Asner, and Michael York. The film also features additional material such as Scrooge's pet bulldog, Debit. Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) features a live action and animated sequence in which Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson dance together in an underwater nightclub. Inspired by the Swedish film Dunderklumpen (1974), Walt Disney Productions's Pete's Dragon (1977) experimented with these techniques. Unlike its predecessors, it put the animated dragon, Elliot, in a live-action setting. (World Premier, Jacob's Pillow August 1981.) It is the fifth theatrical film in The Muppets franchise. Adapted from the 1883 novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, similarly to its predecessor The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), the key roles were played by live-action actors, with the Muppets in supporting roles.\n\n"

Here’s a quick primer for anyone interested in joining the fermented-food trend. Adding fermented foods to the diet can boost immunity and decrease inflammation, with some studies suggesting they might improve conditions such as colitis, IBS, leaky gut, gastric reflux and high cholesterol. Fields and Hodkins advise starting with smaller portions – a couple of tablespoons to only a few ounces per day ̶ to reap healthful benefits. Live fermented foods can be consumed daily, but megadosing could lead to stomach pain, cramping or diarrhea. Fermented foods are fine for most people seeking general health support, but those with gastritis, acid reflux, ulcers, and other gastric issues and serious medical conditions should consult their doctor. Yogurt, a cultured dairy product containing probiotics, is widely popular today, including regular and Greek versions.

Kefir (pronounced “kee’- fur,​” “kuh-feer’,” or “keh’-fur”), a tangy dairy beverage, is most-commonly known as a “drinkable yogurt.” It originates from the Caucasus Mountains in Eastern Europe and is considered a super power in probiotics, because it has more microflora than yogurt ̶ about 50 strains, including bacteria and yeast, says Hodkins. Traditional kefir is cultured with “kefir grains,” a culture of lumpy clumps of beneficial bacteria and yeasts that technically aren’t a “grain.” ​Dairy kefir is a good source of calcium and protein and is traditionally made from cow’s or goat’s milk, but now almond and soy milk varieties are available. Water kefir is a lighter drink made from kefir grains​ (small, translucent-looking crystals) fermented in sugar water, juice, or even coconut water. It was traditionally made with black tea and sugar, but today green tea and honey are also used. ​ Modern “kvass” also refers to sour tonic beverages,​ fermented from vegetables and fruits, that are not the bread-based version. Sauerkraut, kimchi and other fermented vegetables are all microflora-rich when they are made using traditional lacto-fermentation techniques that combine vegetables and salt to produce naturally-occurring healthy bacteria.

It is made by fermenting sugar water with kefir grains and can be flavored with fruits or herbs.

Iroc was also influenced by DJs that he saw in concert, including Jazzy Jeff, Grandmaster Dee, and Master Flash. Iroc would study the work of other DJs, and try to mimic the scratches which he heard. His father, Robert Camposecco, works as a painting contractor while his mother, Donna (née Wells), is a make-up artist who has worked for various celebrities. His paternal grandfather, Bob Campo, was a former radio personality in Wheeling and he has a younger sister named Julia Marie who is married to Stephen Christian of the band Anberlin. Campo is an alumnus of Seminole High School and was a student at the Performers Studio Workshop in Tampa, Florida. Three years later, its appearance on Volume 1 of Art Laboe's “Oldies But Goodies” album series brought it national attention, and it remains a doo-wop favorite to this day.\n\n"

When working with Tappi Tíkarrass, she was heavily influenced by British new wave bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wire, the Passions, the Slits, Joy Division, and Killing Joke. The Sugarcubes' style has been described as avant-pop and alternative \n\n  The use of electronic music technology in rock music coincided with the practical availability of electronic musical instruments and the genre's emergence as a distinct style. Rock music has been highly dependent on technological developments, particularly the invention and refinement of the synthesizer, the development of the MIDI digital format and computer technology. In the late 1960s, rock musicians began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound; by the end of the decade the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock bands who would dominate rock in the early 1970s. Instrumental rock was most popular from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, with artists such as Bill Doggett Combo, The Fireballs, The Shadows, The Ventures, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Spotnicks.

Rock music has been highly dependent on technological developments, particularly the invention and refinement of the synthesizer, the development of the MIDI digital format and computer technology. In the late 1960s, rock musicians began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound; by the end of the decade the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock bands who would dominate rock in the early 1970s. Instrumental rock was most popular from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, with artists such as Bill Doggett Combo, The Fireballs, The Shadows, The Ventures, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Spotnicks.

Reference: Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease.

The main effects of aldosterone on the kidneys occur in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. Additionally, aldosterone stimulates sodium retention in the distal colon and sweat glands through its receptors. The release of renin from the kidneys leads to the production of angiotensin II, which stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can also stimulate aldosterone secretion. Reference:\n- The adrenal cortex comprises three main zones, or layers that are regulated by distinct hormones. Aldosterone is a hormone secreted by the cells of the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. Specifically, aldosterone stimulates the resorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the nephron. This leads to an increase in the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream, thereby promoting the retention of sodium by the body. Juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to low blood pressure or low blood sodium levels. As aldosterone levels increase, it leads to an increase in blood pressure, sodium concentration, and blood volume, thereby inhibiting the release of renin.
