The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. However, people transferred to \n\n British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government relating to the epidemic, raising concerns that the Beijing government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Asymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March. During the pandemic, no reports of cases of the COVID-19 in Xinjiang prisons or of conditions in \n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications. Signs and symptoms\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission\n\nVirology\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. Pathophysiology\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia. Furthermore, microvascular (arterioles and capillaries) blood vessel damage has been reported in a small number of tissue samples of the brainswithout detected SARS-CoV-2and the olfactory bulbs from those who have died from COVID‑19. COVID‑19 was also found to cause substantial – including morphological and mechanical – changes to blood cells – such as increased sizes – sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge. Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. Immunopathology\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL2, IL7, IL6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP1alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology. Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with COVID‑19. Viral and host factors\n\nVirus proteins\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. S1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. It is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective COVID‑19 vaccines. It is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope. The N and E protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response. Host factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-COV2 virus targets causing COVID‑19. The effect of the virus on ACE2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. Among healthy adults not exposed to SARS-CoV-2, about 35% have CD4+ T cells that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (particularly the S2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses. It is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to COVID‑19. Host cytokine response\n\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease. The cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the CNS are not uncommon. Pregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Given that they are prone to suffering from complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures. Physiological responses to pregnancy can include:\n Immunological: The immunological response to COVID-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. Respiratory: Many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. However, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus. On the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavorable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. Some examples of these could be fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the fetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life. Unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with COVID-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. Pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. Diagnosis\n\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions. Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection. Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection. Viral testing\n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used. The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" On 7September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Imaging\n\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening. Many groups have created COVID‑19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases. Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID‑19. A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive. Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial. Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\". This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. The risk of COVID‑19 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. Recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air. Coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the UV light in sunlight. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%). The virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation. The CDC recommends that if a COVID‑19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups. Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure. A meta-analysis, published online in October 2021, concluded that \"Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms.\" Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases. While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening. Treatment\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. On 30 October 2020, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom warned that \"to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" He has described the vast spectrum of COVID‑19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. Acting on the same ACE2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease. Short term and chronic exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from COVID‑19. Pre-existing heart and lung diseases and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of COVID‑19. It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2. Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. Children\n\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole. Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults. Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal. In the case of pregnant women, it is important to note that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID‑19. This is because pregnant women with COVID‑19 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Longer-term effects\n\nSome early studies suggest that 10–20% of people with COVID‑19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. Overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by DLCO, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time. Immunity\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease. Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms. Reinfection with COVID‑19 is possible but uncommon. The first case of reinfection was documented in August 2020. A systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of May 2021. These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. For example, the case fatality rate for COVID‑19 is lower in India than in the US since India's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the US. Infection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk. This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases. That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID‑19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. On 2July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%. In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%. Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%, and ~1.4%. One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58). The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women. Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men. As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections. That structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease. Comorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases. When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID‑19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms. The WHO recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID‑19 could not rule out co-infections. History\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. The possibility that the virus was accidentally released from a laboratory is also under increasingly active consideration. U.S intelligence agencies found that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and that it is unlikely for it to have been genetically engineered. The first confirmed human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1December 2019. Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8December 2019. Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020. The number of COVID-19 cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then, and more may have been infected. A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\". On 30 January, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020. RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and December 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected. , Reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to COVID‑19 to have exceeded five million. Misinformation\n\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online. Other species\n\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID‑19 virus. , hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica. , more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far. Treatment-related research\n\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments. Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best, and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir. Because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the WHO, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids. Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the NIH for patients with COVID‑19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID‑19 who do not require supplemental oxygen. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID‑19. Cytokine storm\n\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed. It is undergoing a PhaseII non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease. Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people. There is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies. As of 8August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies. It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections. Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible. The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID‑19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients. This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results. Effect on other diseases and the pharmacy trade\nThere was a report on 3March 2021, that social distancing and common wearing of surgical masks and similar as a common precaution against COVID‑19 caused a drop in the spread rate of the common cold and flu.

The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. Novelty\nBased on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil \nDespite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg.\n\nEfficacy and clinical trials\nIn 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. Tolerability and side effects\nLY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. Eli Lilly stops phase III development\nIn August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\".

In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline.

Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented \"discrimination\" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as \"tyranny\" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests. Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat, M.D. Working together with governors, mayors, tribal leaders, state and local health departments, the medical community and our private sector partners, we have been monitoring the spread of H1N1 and facilitating prevention and treatment, including implementing a vaccination program. CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. One major area of effort is the tracking and monitoring of influenza activity, which helps individuals and institutions monitor and understand the impact of the 2009 H1N1 virus. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Data about the virus from around the world—much of it collected with CDC assistance—have shown that the circulating pandemic H1N1 virus has not mutated significantly since the spring, and the virus remains very closely matched to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain. Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants. Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries. A fourth major area of effort is prevention through vaccination. Vaccination is our most effective tool to reduce the impact of influenza. CDC, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), characterized the virus, identified a candidate vaccine strain, and our HHS partners expedited manufacturing, initiated clinical trials, and licensed four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines all within five months. Tens of millions of doses have become available for ordering, and millions more become available each week. Two types of 2009 H1N1 vaccine are now available: injectable vaccine made from inactivated virus, including thimerosal-free formulations, and nasal vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) virus. CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that 2009 H1N1 vaccines be directed to target populations at greatest risk of illness and severe disease caused by this virus. These groups are: pregnant women; people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age; health care and emergency services personnel; persons between the ages of 6 months through 24 years of age; and people from ages 25 through 64 years who are at higher risk for severe disease because of chronic health disorders like asthma, diabetes, or compromised immune systems. In addition, ACIP recommended that local public health authorities may want to prioritize a smaller group of people while supplies are limited, in which case the following groups who are at the highest risk for infection or severe illness should receive the vaccine before others: pregnant women, people who live with or care for children younger than 6 months of age, health care and emergency medical services personnel with direct patient contact, children 6 months through 4 years of age, and children 5 through 18 years of age who have chronic medical conditions. So far the reports of adverse events among H1N1 vaccination are generally mild and are similar to those we see with seasonal flu vaccine. CDC and FDA have been working to enhance surveillance systems to rapidly detect any unexpected adverse events among vaccinated persons and to adjust the vaccination program to minimize these risks. These systems are designed to determine whether adverse events are occurring among vaccinated persons at a greater rate than among unvaccinated persons. In the spring, anticipating commercial market constraints, HHS deployed 11 million courses of antiviral drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to ensure the nation was positioned to quickly employ these drugs to combat 2009 H1N1 and its spread. In early October, HHS shipped an additional 300,000 bottles of the oral suspension formulation of the antiviral oseltamivir to states in order to mitigate a predicted near-term national shortage indicated by commercial supply data. Finally, CDC and FDA have also worked together to address potential options for treatment of seriously ill hospitalized patients with influenza, including situations in which physicians may wish to use investigational formulations of antiviral drugs for intravenous therapy. There have been enormous efforts in the United States and abroad to prepare for this kind of challenge. Germany often do not live in the same household as their extended family and this has reduced the number of infections. ; Germany has many test laboratories and a weekly test capacity of 160 thousand and could have a lower number of unrecorded cases of infections than for example Italy, though the number of tests including negative results was unknown until 23 March. ; Italy has several times fewer hospital beds for intensive respiratory care than Germany. While Italy and Spain ran out of beds, German hospitals still had free capacity. The number of beds, protective gear and the number of medical personnel can become bottlenecks for providing adequate care. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it. This was decided based on the statistics showing that there were only 19 fatal cases out of more than 25 million people who had already received it worldwide. Many countries in Europe have also resumed administering the vaccine but put restrictions on it. This includes Germany who limited it to people over age 60 and France who limited it to people over \n\nThe TeamHeath Medical Call Center (THMCC) is one of the country’s most established, reputable and sought after providers of telephone nurse triage clinical care. For more than 22 years and 11 million successfully managed calls, our team of highly skilled registered nurses know one thing is for certain: every year, the flu returns to wreak havoc on patients, providers, and all aspects of healthcare in general. As you are reading this, the 2018-19 FLU SEASON is already beginning its annual intrusion. • The flu is devastating to the old and young. • Getting vaccinated in the most impactful, preventative measure to alleviate the effects of the flu. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctor visits, missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Also, there is data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder. • Do insurance plans have to pay for flu vaccines? Experience is the best teacher. THMCC has more than 22 years of experience gained from caring for millions of patients.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Using the patient's own stem cells with genetic correction \n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first life-saving gene therapy for children, developed by Italian scientists and GlaxoSmithKline, has been recommended for approval in Europe, boosting the pioneering technology to fix faulty genes. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available. Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development. Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells. Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development. Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years. ; Inclusion criteria are pre-symptomatic late infantiles and both pre- and early-symptomatic juveniles. ; The trial was at a single center at the San Raffaele Institute in Milan, Italy. The trial had several compassionate access patients and ultimately was expanded to 20 patients'' ; In late 2013 GSK exercised its option for the San Rafaelle gene therapy technology and is working with the Milan Investigators to prepare \n\n of ADA injections may impair the success of gene therapy, since transduced cells will have no selective advantage to proliferate if untransduced cells can survive in the presence of the injected ADA. In 2000, a gene therapy \"success\" resulted in SCID patients with a functional immune system. Work aimed at improving gene therapy is now focusing on modifying the viral vector to reduce the likelihood of oncogenesis and using zinc-finger nucleases to further target gene \n\nGene therapy with an autologous stem cell transplant – Italian researchers at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute tested a novel approach combining gene therapy with an autologous stem cell transplant. ; Gene therapy for late infantile and early juvenile patients was approved by the European Commission in December 2020 after receiving a favorable European Medicines Agency CHMP review in October 2020.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\" However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include:\n E-liquid vaporizers\n Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances:\n Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and\n No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Because the cells of the heart do not replace themselves naturally, those who have suffered from heart disease may have few treatment options available. Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease. Stem cells may be used to help replace the damaged heart tissue and valves and establish new vessels to supply them with blood. Stem cells could also be used to build new heart tissue, even whole new hearts. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs. About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells. In 2001, scientists reported that after they injected stem cells into the damaged wall of the ventricle, these cells led to the formation of new cells, which in turn developed into coronary arteries, arterioles and capillaries. The researchers found that mice that received the transplanted cells survived in greater numbers than mice with heart attacks that did not receive the mouse stem cells. In 2003, sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville became the first human to receive experimental stem cell therapy to revive his damaged heart tissue. In lieu of heart transplant surgery, Bonnville’s parents opted for a stem cell therapy to repair his damaged heart. Prior to this clinical trial, scientists in Brazil had already tested the treatment on fourteen patients. It reported on a study that divided 70 cardiac patients into two equal groups: one group was injected with stem cells, and the other group received a placebo. Six months later, the patients treated with stem cells had a significant improvement in left ventricular pumping, and in the control group, there was no improvement. A study looking at safety and feasibility of infusing cord blood stem cells into the hearts of babies born with a defect known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is nearing completion, and we have already heard of one family who is sleeping better knowing their little boy is on the road to recovery. “Prior to the 1980s and '90s, there were essentially no good surgical options for these patients,” said Dr. Joe Rossano, who heads up the cardiac center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, “but a number of very innovative surgical techniques were developed that have allowed many of these children to survive and thrive.\" This would normally require the patient to undergo a heart transplant later down the road, but researchers think an infusion of cord blood could solve the problem by making the right side of the heart two times to five times stronger. “We're finding ways of inventing new therapies to make that right heart stronger by stimulating the growth of the heart muscle and make the five-horsepower engine, a 10-horsepower engine, a 50-horsepower engine,” said Dr. Tim Nelson, who researches and conducts new HLHS treatments. “And if we make it strong enough, we believe that that has a shot at delaying and preventing transplant for a significant number of these children.\" CHOP became one of a number of institutions who joined together to help expand access to this clinical trial, and the Sextons quickly put their child in the care of the CHOP as the first family to undergo the treatment. After collecting the cord blood at the time of birth, processing it in Minnesota and cryo-preserving it for three months, the cord blood stem cells were thawed and infused directly into Ryals’s heart near the end of his second operation. In 2007, Sir Magdi Yacoub, a world-famous heart surgeon based at Imperial College London, and a team of researchers developed heart valve cells with stem cells. They used collagen to hold the valve tissue in shape as it grew into one-inch disk-shaped valves. Presenting at the American Heart Association's annual scientific sessions in New Orleans during November 2008, cardiac surgeon Dr. Ralf Sodian reported that his team had used stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood to create tissue-engineered heart valves. Stem cells collected at birth from the umbilical cord may help doctors fashion new heart valves for children born with heart valve defects. In Circulation Research, Timothy Kamp, co-director of the university's Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Center, reported that the reprogrammed heart cells made in the laboratory generated electrical pulses, and in response to these pulses, they contracted. \"If you have a heart failure patient who is in dire straits and there are never enough donor hearts for transplantation, we may be able to make heart cells from the patient's skin cells and use them to repair heart muscle. A 2014 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials involving 1,255 participants showed a reduce risk of mortality or re-hospitalization in the long-term for patients who underwent a stem cell therapy for heart disease. As scientists have been better developing an understanding of how these stem cells are aiding heart repair, they have moved more and more towards mesenchymal stem cells as a source. While found in cord blood, mesenchymal stem cells can be found in greater abundance in cord tissue. Today, more and more clinical trials using stem cells like those found in cord tissue are being used to treat heart disease. As scientists gain further insight into how, when, which and to what capacity stem cells can be used to treat heart conditions through these clinical trials, we grow ever closer to potentially discovering a whole new way to mend a broken heart. the validity of this research, including the appropriateness of the samples as representative of normally aging hearts. Regardless, further research has been conducted that supports the potential for human cardiac regeneration. The purpose of these studies was to determine if stem cells safely taken from an individual’s bone marrow could be transplanted back into the injured heart muscle of the individual and improve the heart’s ability to pump following a heart attack, as well as to determine the best time for transplanting the cells following a heart attack. The results of both studies were presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific meetings in 2011 (LateTIME) and 2012 (TIME), and simultaneously \n\n to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death. What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of injecting bone marrow stem cells into heart muscle in an attempt to promote blood vessel growth that could potentially improve the blood supply in hearts that are failing.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense (\"buoyant\") LDL. Accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is important because it helps assess their risk of heart disease. LDL cholesterol, also known as \"bad\" cholesterol, builds up in artery walls and contributes to the formation of plaque, which can harden and narrow the arteries. Traditionally, the measurement of LDL cholesterol may underestimate its actual levels. However, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a more precise calculation method that provides a more individualized and accurate assessment of risks associated with LDL cholesterol. Regular screening and monitoring of LDL cholesterol levels can help guide treatment decisions and interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and medication therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Regular monitoring and management of LDL cholesterol levels are essential for maintaining heart health. The problem with this approach is that LDL-C values are commonly discordant with both direct measurements of LDL particles and actual rates of atherosclerosis progression. Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a couple of laboratories in the United States.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical comes of open reduction surgery for anterior shoulder dislocation combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Figure 2: Schematic diagram of shoulder position. Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Clinical studies have shown that anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will cause very serious shoulder soft tissue injury, so that patients show varying degrees of shoulder joint activity disorder in the daily life and training process. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord 2014; 15: 206. J Orthop Trauma 2000; 14: 36-40. Xuhui L.

While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. Another study suggested that \"shneck pain\" was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain. Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City. Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative. The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively. Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own. These students also believed that stress, a potential severe manifestation of suicidal ideation, was part of a normal college environment and not something to raise concern. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Given the large number of attempted suicides, the chances that you will encounter someone planning to take their ownlife is highly probable. usually considered suicide. The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years. The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6). Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths. In 2015, the suicide rate in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one seventh of the global average. Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths. The report points to things such as impulse control, and access to means of self-harm such as firearms and prescription drugs. According to the report, 16 percent of North Carolina high school students reported considering suicide in 2017. Studies have demonstrated that asking if a depressed friend or family member has thought of committing suicide is an effective way of identifying those at risk, and it does not \"plant\" the idea or increase an individual's risk for suicide in any way. Depressive disorder is frequent in primary care and general hospital\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

June 17 2017 by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of persons with autism achieving some degree of independent living. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. \"We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia,\" said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish \"bricks\" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. We examined the phospholipid fatty acids in the plasma of a population of autism subjects compared to mentally retarded controls. Our results showed a marked reduction in the levels of 22: 6n-3 (23%) in the autism subjects, resulting in significantly lower levels of total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (20%), without significant reduction in the (n-6) PUFA series, and consequently a significant increase in the (n-6)/(n-3) ratio (25%). Not wanting to medicate our son, we are thankful for the discovery of the effects of kava on the behaviors of autism. The serotonin system could be involved in autism, since there is a different metabolic response to 5HTP administration in children with autism compared to controls (see study below). Bacteria living in the intestines and colon may affect symptoms of autism by releasing substances in the gut that cross into the blood and make it to brain tissue and influence the health of nerve cells or influence the release of brain chemicals. A small study found that some children with autism have different types of intestinal germs compared to children without autism. �If left unchecked, however, harmful bacteria can excrete dangerous metabolites or disturb a balance in metabolites that can affect the gut and the rest of the body, including the brain.\" My comments: It is still not clear whether supplementation with probiotics or changes in dietary intake of fermented foods can make a difference in children with autism. Makes one ponder whether perhaps certain forms of mental conditions, for instance chronic anxiety, mood disorders, and others, may be, at least slightly or partially, influenced by manipulation of the intestinal microflora. Email November 2011 - A study came out last June which suggested that d-Ribose could be helpful for autism. Pilot study of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement for children with autistic spectrum disorder. Determine the effect of a moderate dose multivitamin / mineral supplement on children with autistic spectrum disorder. This may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in many children and adults with autism. Pediatrics. Core symptoms of autism improved after vitamin d supplementation. This report is one case study of a 3 year old boy who improved after vitamn D supplementation. Institute at the University of California Davis Health System in Sacramento, and her team report, \"Melatonin can be considered a safe and effective pharmacologic treatment in addition to behavior therapies and sleep hygiene practices for the management of sleep problems in children with autistic spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome.\" In a 4-week study, 18 children, ranging in age from 2 to 15 years, with autistic spectrum disorder and/or fragile X syndrome were given either 3 mg melatonin or placebo each night for 2 weeks. The children then \"crossed over\" to the other treatment group for 2 weeks. The main feature of autism is impaired social interaction. Sleep problems are reported in the vast majority of children with autism and fragile X syndrome. Having a parent or a mother with psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia increases a child's risk of having autism. Low birth weight and preterm delivery are a cause. Advanced parental age appears to increase autism risk in children, and the risk is seen with both mothers and fathers. Pediatrics, 2010. Expectant mothers suffering from asthma, allergies or a type of skin disease have a higher risk of giving birth to an autistic child. Obese mothers are more likely to have autistic children. Environmental pollutants, in addition to genetics, play a role in autism development. Children whose mothers took certain asthma drugs during pregnancy may have a slightly increased risk of autism. The study, published online Jan. 6 2016 in Pediatrics, found a connection between autism risk and prenatal exposure to drugs called beta-agonists. Children living in an area of New York state that uses aerial pesticides to control mosquitoes have a higher rate of autism than children in neighboring areas. Is it possible that children given too many vaccines could develop signs of autism? There is a debate in the medical community regarding the role of vaccines in causing or precipitating autism. Over the past two decades so many new vaccines have been added to a child's vaccination list that the medical community has little idea how all of these interact with each other and how they influence the immune system and neural tissue. There does not appear to be a link between the season or month a child is born and the subsequent risk. I have not seen any evidence that autism is a result of toxins or toxic metals. There are three large categories of autism treatment: Behavioral modification and communication approaches, dietary and nutritional approaches, complementary approaches. Tests on the brain tissue of 11 patients with autism who had died and spinal fluid from six living children with autism showed the activation of immune system responses. In a study published in the online edition of the Annals of Neurology, researchers said they found abnormal activity by immune system signaling chemicals called chemokines in the autistic patients. This ongoing inflammatory process was present in different areas of the brain and produced by cells known as microglia and astroglia. Any opinions about chelation therapy?

She has authored a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006). This book delves into the topic of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy and offers insights into this specific approach to hormone therapy. Furthermore, Somers has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and even a book of poetry, showcasing her diverse range of interests and talents. Throughout her career, Suzanne Somers has been a strong advocate for various health-related issues. However, her views on some medical subjects have faced criticism. She has faced scrutiny for her support of the Wiley Protocol, which is deemed \"scientifically unproven and dangerous.\" Additionally, her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has drawn criticism from the American Cancer Society. It is worth noting that while Somers has achieved success in her career, her ventures into health-related advocacy have been met with controversy. Suzanne Marie Somers (née Mahoney; October 16, 1946) is an American actress, author, singer, businesswoman, and health spokesperson. Somers later became the author of a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006), about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Somers has been criticized for her views on some medical subjects and her advocacy of the Wiley Protocol, which has been labelled as \"scientifically unproven and dangerous\". Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969–70), where she met host Alan Hamel. Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president  Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled Suzanne Somers, which lasted one season. \"Breaking Through\nIn 2012, Somers began an online talk show, Suzanne Somers Breaking Through, at CafeMom.

Her book, Ageless, includes interviews with 16 practitioners of bioidentical hormone therapy, but gives extra discussion to one specific approach, the \"Wiley Protocol\". Somers and T. S. Wiley, the originator of the Wiley Protocol, have been criticized for their advocacy of the Wiley Protocol. A group of seven doctors, all of whom utilize bioidentical hormone therapies to address health issues in women, issued a public letter to Somers and her publisher, Crown, in which they state that the protocol is \"scientifically unproven and dangerous\" and cite Wiley's lack of medical and clinical qualifications. The use of bioidentical hormone therapies is a very controversial area of medicine; its efficacy has never been tested and numerous groups have expressed concern over its safety and the misleading claims made by practitioners, which was the subject of an Associated Press article:\n \"The problem, for many doctors: These custom-compounded products are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. ...

Another headline, on Salon.com: 'Oprah's Bad Medicine'.\" In 2001, Somers was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy, and radiation, but declined to undergo chemotherapy. In November 2008,  Somers announced she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer by six doctors, but she learned a week later that she was misdiagnosed. During this time, she interviewed doctors about cancer treatments and these interviews became the basis of her book, Knockout, about alternative treatments to chemotherapy. In her book Knockout, Somers promotes alternative cancer treatments, for which she was criticized by the American Cancer Society:\n\n \"The American Cancer Society is concerned. ... 'I am very afraid that people are going to listen to her message and follow what she says and be harmed by it', says Dr. Otis Brawley, the organization's chief medical officer.

More broadly, Brawley is concerned that in the United States, celebrities or sports stars feel they can use their fame to dispense medical advice. 'There's a tendency to oversimplify medical messages.... Well, oversimplification can kill.'\" She is also opposed to water fluoridation. She stated that all these chemicals may \"overelectrify the brain\". Conversely, early surgical menopause has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of these diseases. However, the most compelling supportive evidence is from studies of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Research with women and men undertaking HRT has shown that taking sex hormones that are biologically identical to human hormones delays the onset, decreases the incidence of, and can reverse the course of age related illnesses such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and some types of cancer. However, only biological hormones appear to have these effects.

In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%. In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo. \"It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future,\" he tells WebMD. Nishimura was not involved with the study. The new drug works differently than statins do. It inhibits a protein called PCSK9. This, in turn, clears LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Statin drugs work in a different way to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone. About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins. Both studies are too small and too short to draw any conclusions about the drugs' safety, Raymond Gibbons, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a past president of the American Heart Association, tells WebMD. This REGN727 study was funded by Sanofi U.S. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which make the drug. The AMG 145 study was presented by Amgen, the drug's maker. Adding an experimental new biologic drug to conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs may result in better cholesterol control and reduced risks of heart attack and stroke, according to a new study. The findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's maker, Amgen. Sabatine's group looked at 4,465 patients who had already completed one of the 12 phase II or III trials to evaluate the drug. The patients were offered an opportunity to join a one-year extension trial. The researchers randomly assigned patients to either standard treatment -- usually with cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins -- or to standard treatment as well as the new drug. The new drug works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL -- or so-called ''bad'' -- cholesterol from the blood, the researchers explained. \"This is a new class of drugs. \"Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. Those on the biologic were about half as likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the one-year follow-up. Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. The drugs, known as PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, \"have demonstrated impressive reductions in LDL levels,'' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. While those on the combination therapy had half the risk of heart attack and stroke as those on standard statin therapy, the difference between the two groups was small -- only about 1 percent. A second preliminary study to be presented Sunday at the cardiology meeting found that another experimental drug, alirocumab, also lowered levels of LDL cholesterol when combined with statin therapy. Statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of \n\n In the US, the American Heart Association, NIH, and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting LDL-Cholesterol levels, estimated or measured, and risk for heart disease. As of about 2005, these guidelines were: Over time, with more clinical research, these recommended levels keep being reduced because LDL reduction, including to abnormally low levels, was the most effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular death rates in one large double blind, randomized clinical trial of men with hypercholesterolemia; far more effective than coronary angioplasty/stenting or bypass surgery. Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note to clients that Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, has a different method of reducing \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. A year and a half after its feted approval, a new cholesterol drug has passed a key test. Those benefits are clinically significant, not just statistically significant, and in a conference call hosted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc.'s senior biotech analyst Salim Syed, James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Medical School and president-elect of the national lipid association, stressed the good news about the results. \"There are an very bad lot of people with really quite high cholesterol out there and we'll probably need more than one drug to get their levels down\". Almost all were taking modest or large doses of statins. \"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine\". \"Now we have more confidence that not only are we are helping on the biochemistry reports numbers, but also helping keep patients out of emergency rooms and cardiac operating theatres\".\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Indications: Kyleena is a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years. • Release rate of levonorgestrel (LNG) is 17.5 mcg/day after 24 days and declines to 7.4 mcg/day after 5 years; Kyleena must be removed or replaced after 5 years. • To be inserted by a trained healthcare provider using strict aseptic technique. • Patient should be re-examined and evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after insertion; then yearly or more often if clinically indicated. Safety and efficacy: The contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena.

Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. In 2006–2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%), male sterilization (8.8%), intrauterine device (4.9%), withdrawal (4.6%).

In his third game, against the Philadelphia Flyers, Catenacci was injured by a check from Radko Gudas. After spending a week on the injured reserve list, Catenacci was reassigned to Rochester on February 19. He finished the season playing in 11 games with Buffalo, scoring no points.

The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever. ​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika. It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely. If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. If that weren’t enough to give any thinking person pause about the risk to the unborn child of injecting aluminum into the mom, the safety of giving Tdap has never been tested on pregnant women. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in 2014 to kill mosquito larvae. ​Microcephaly occurs in about 2 - 12 babies out of 10,000 in the Uniited States (source). Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December. ​When I was training to be a doctor in the 1980s we saw cases of severe microcephaly, cased by congenital rubella syndrome, CRS. I held a newborn in my arms who had a severely deformed and tiny head, CRS. ​Congenital rubella can also occur when a newly pregnant woman or a woman about to get pregnant is given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The CDC warns that the MMR vaccine, “should not be administered to women known to be pregnant. Because a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source). ​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese). Perhaps it is the MMR vaccine, not the Zika virus, that is the real culprit? Stop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits. Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic. But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are in a fast and furious race to develop another vaccine … against the Zika virus. abnormalities in unborn babies, was reported in Brazil. The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus. A public health emergency was also announced in Puerto Rico by Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Sylvia Burwell at the behest of Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, suggesting that \n\nZika fever, also known as Zika virus disease or simply Zika, is an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nZika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy \n\nThe disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology \nIn fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis \nIt is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Infant testing \nFor infants with suspected congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications  should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, and herpes simplex virus. Breastfeeding is still recommended by the WHO, even by women who have had Zika fever. There have been no recorded cases of Zika transmission to infants through breastfeeding, though the replicative virus has been detected in breast milk. WHO response \nBoth the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) as well as the WHO have issued statements of concern about the widespread public health impact of the Zika virus and its links to GBS and microcephaly. The WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, issued a statement in February 2016 \"declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil, following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014, constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Oxitec’s genetically modified OX513A mosquito was approved by Brazil's National Biosecurity Technical Commission (CTNBio) in April 2014 and it was being used to try to combat mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus in the town of Piracicaba, São Paulo in 2016. Care is supportive with treatment of pain, fever, and itching. Some authorities have recommended against using aspirin and other NSAIDs as these have been associated with hemorrhagic syndrome when used for other flaviviruses. The fetus of a pregnant woman who has Zika fever may die or be born with congenital central nervous system malformations, like microcephaly. Epidemiology \n\nIn April 1947, as part of studies sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation into yellow fever, 6 caged rhesus monkeys were placed in the canopy of the Zika Forest of Uganda. In May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of the illness. According to the Brazilian Health Ministry, as of November 2015 there was no official count of the number of people infected with the virus in Brazil, since the disease is not subject to compulsory notification. Mosquito-borne Zika virus is suspected to be the cause of 2,400 possible cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015 (of the 2400 or so notified cases in 2015, 2165 were under investigation in December 2015, 134 were confirmed and 102 were ruled out for microcephaly). The Brazilian Health Ministry has reported at least 2,400 suspected cases of microcephaly in the country in 2015 as of 12 December, and 29 fatalities. In the state of Pernambuco the reported rates of microcephaly in 2015 are 77 times higher than in the previous 5 years. A model using data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia estimated the risk of microcephaly in children born to mothers who acquired Zika virus in the first trimester to be 1%. In February 2016, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as evidence grew that Zika is a cause of birth defects and neurological problems. In April 2016, WHO stated there is a scientific consensus, based on preliminary evidence, that Zika is a cause of microcephaly in infants and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. In the Americas the number of cases peaked during the first half of 2016 and declined through 2017–2018, with a total of 31,587 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of ZIKV disease were reported in the Region of the Americas. Microcephaly and other infant disorders \nZika virus was first identified in the late 1940s in Kampala, Uganda, Africa but was first confirmed in Brazil. Following the initial Zika outbreak in Northeastern Brazil in May 2015, physicians observed a very large surge of reports of infants born with microcephaly, with 20 times the number of expected cases. Many of these cases have since been confirmed, leading WHO officials to project that approximately 2,500 infants will be found to have born in Brazil with Zika-related microcephaly. For example, the effects on an infant might not be seen until months after the mother's initial infection, long after the time when Zika is easily detected in the body. Since the initial outbreak, studies that use several different methods found evidence of a link, leading public health officials to conclude that it appears increasingly likely the virus is linked to microcephaly and miscarriage. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization declared recently reported clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 8 March 2016, the WHO Committee reconfirmed that the association between Zika and neurological disorders is of global concern. The Zika virus was first linked with newborn microcephaly during the Brazil Zika virus outbreak. In 2015, there were 2,782 suspected cases of microcephaly compared with 147 in 2014 and 167 in 2013. Confirmation of many of the recent cases is pending, and it is difficult to estimate how many cases went unreported before the recent awareness of the risk of virus infections. In November 2015, the Zika virus was isolated in a newborn baby from the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil, with microcephaly and other congenital disorders. The Lancet medical journal reported in January 2016 that the Brazilian Ministry of Health had confirmed 134 cases of microcephaly \"believed to be associated with Zika virus infection\" with an additional 2,165 cases in 549 counties in 20 states remaining under investigation. An analysis of 574 cases of microcephaly in Brazil during 2015 and the first week of 2016, reported in March 2016, found an association with maternal illness involving rash and fever during the first trimester of pregnancy. During this period, 12 Brazilian states reported increases of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs) in cases of microcephaly compared with 2000–14, with the northeastern states of Bahia, Paraíba and Pernambuco reporting increases of more than 20 SDs. In January 2016, a baby in Oahu, Hawaii, was born with microcephaly, the first case in the United States of brain damage linked to the virus. The baby and mother tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. Her pregnancy had progressed normally, and the baby's condition was not known until birth. In one study in Pernambuco state in Brazil, about 40 percent of babies with Zika-related microcephaly also had scarring of the retina with spots, or pigment alteration. Also in February 2016, rumors that microcephaly is caused by the use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen in drinking water were refuted by scientists. \"It's important to state that some localities that do not use pyriproxyfen also had reported cases of microcephaly\", read a Brazilian government statement. The Brazilian government also refuted conspiracy theories that chickenpox and rubella vaccinations or genetically modified mosquitoes were causing increases in microcephaly. One other study published in March 2016 by Mlakar and colleagues analyzed autopsy tissues from a fetus with microcephaly that was probably related to Zika virus; researchers found ZIKV in the brain tissue and suggested that the brain injuries were probably associated with the virus, which also shed a light on the vertical transmission theory. Also in March 2016, first solid evidence was reported on how the virus affects the development of the brain, indicating that it appears to preferentially kill developing brain cells. The first cases of birth defects linked to Zika in Colombia and in Panama were reported in March 2016. Guillain–Barré syndrome \nA high rate of the autoimmune disease Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), noted in the French Polynesia outbreak, has also been found in the outbreak that began in Brazil. Research\n\nMechanism \nResearch has been ongoing to better understand how Zika virus causes microcephaly and other neurological disorders. It may involve infection of the primary neural stem cells of the fetal brain, known as neural progenitor cells. Infection of brain stem cells can cause cell death, which reduces the production of future neurons and leads to a smaller brain. In addition to inducing cell death, infection of neural progenitor cells may alter the process of cell proliferation, causing a depletion in the pool of progenitor cells. A large number of cases of microcephaly have been associated with inherited gene mutations, and specifically with mutations that lead to dysfunction of the mitotic spindle. Another line of research considers that Zika, unlike other flaviviruses, may target developing brain cells after it crosses the placenta, and considers the resulting damage likely to be the result of inflammation as a byproduct of the immune response to the infection of those cells. Mosquito control \nSome experimental methods of prevention include breeding and releasing mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to prevent them from transmitting pathogens, or have been infected with the Wolbachia bacterium, believed to inhibit the spread of viruses. In 2016 the World Health Organization encouraged field trials of transgenic male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes developed by Oxitec to try to halt the spread of the Zika virus. Insect-borne diseases\nSexually transmitted diseases and infections\nZika virus\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\nArticles containing video clips\nWikipedia infectious disease articles ready to translate\n\n Zika virus has been shown to have teratogenic effects, causing defects in fetal neurological development. Cerebral organoids have been used in studies in order to understand the process by which Zika virus affects the fetal brain and, in some cases, causes microcephaly. Cerebral organoids infected with the Zika virus have been found to be smaller in size than their uninfected counterparts, which is reflective of fetal microcephaly. Increased apoptosis was also found in cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus. The two methods by which NPC populations were reduced were increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation. Additionally, lumen size was found to be increased in organoids infected with Zika virus. The results found from studying cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus at different stages of maturation suggest that early exposure in developing fetuses can cause greater likelihood of Zika virus-associated neurological birth defects. many fronts, with much effort devoted to developing anti-Zika virus vaccines and therapeutics. The WHO's priority was to develop a vaccine that was safe for use by pregnant women.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. Labels such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHA), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder are becoming so common place, that teachers themselves are expected to not only recognise children with these labels, but to also provide appropriate support for them within the classroom setting. But what if this new label could actually explain many of the difficulties a child is experiencing and may actually result in the removal of some of the other labels? This is potentially the case for children affected by aspects of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them. Although CVI has recently been recognised as the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world, the vast continuum of visual difficulties associated with this umbrella term means that many of our children are not being correctly diagnosed. At one end of the CVI continuum, there are children who are functionally blind and don’t appear to be able to “see” the world around them. Fortunately, these children are more likely to receive an overall diagnosis of CVI, as their visual issues are more obvious. However, at the other end of the continuum, are children who may appear to have normal or near normal visual acuity when assessed by an optometrist (meaning that they are able to read to a level on the eye chart that is considered within normal range i.e. Despite having normal or near normal visual acuity however, many children are greatly affected by what is commonly referred to as visual perceptual difficulties. - fatigues easily and appears to get frustrated / anxious easily. Another important aspect of visual perceptual difficulties, is that these issues are made worse when the environment around a person with these difficulties is cluttered. When children are diagnosed with certain impairments such as: ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder, tools and teaching strategies are implemented in the classroom to help ensure the child has the same opportunities to learn as his or her peers. But if the child has been incorrectly diagnosed with one of those conditions, as a result of the similarities between visual perceptual difficulties and these impairments, or they have visual perceptual difficulties in addition to another impairment, the interventions being used may not be as effective as they could be. To help provide an optimal learning environment for not only children with visual perceptual difficulties, but for all children, the first step any teacher needs to take, is to look closely at their classroom environment and get a feel for how cluttered it actually is. To learn more about this common yet often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed condition, tune in for part two of this blog series on visual perceptual difficulties. The Children's Nonverbal Learning Disabilities Scale (C-NLD) is an assessment that screens for the symptoms for nonverbal learning disabilities in children, which can affect a child's visual spatial organization, motor abilities, and social interactions. If you've just learned that your child is visually impaired, you are probably trying to sort out how serious the problem is, where to get help, and what this means for your child's future. In many cases, visual impairments can be corrected. If your child's visual impairment is serious, give yourself time to adjust. One in 20 preschoolers and 1 in 4 school-age children have vision problems, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Glasses or contacts can usually improve it. Glasses can usually improve it. If detected early, temporarily patching the normal eye may resolve the problem by forcing the brain to use the affected eye. Amblyopia, also know as \"lazy eye,\" occurs when vision in one eye is reduced. Cortical visual impairment (CVI). Not enough oxygen to the brain, brain injury, or infections such as encephalitis and meningitis can cause CVI. It can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment and blindness. If more severe, ROP can result in permanent vision impairment or blindness. Genetically transmitted visual impairments. Infantile cataracts (a cloudy lens) and congenital glaucoma (a disorder that damages the optic nerve) often run in families. They can cause vision impairment. This is particularly important if your child has risk factors or a family history of eye problems. Children need their vision checked at infancy, 6 months, between 3 and 3 1/2 years, and upon entering school, around the age of 5. Visually impaired children can have learning problems that range from mild to severe. Check in with your child and your child's teachers often to make sure that he or she is thriving at school and that appropriate support is in place to meet your child's needs. If your child's visual impairment is severe, he or she may need help from other specialists to develop life skills. Specialists in low-vision rehabilitation and mobility are trained to help visually impaired children adapt to their environment and develop independence. Today, there are also many low-vision devices and adaptive technologies that will help your child communicate, learn, and lead an independent life.

Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. Risk factors include poor immune function such as from diabetes or cancer, obesity, alcoholism, intravenous drug use, and peripheral artery disease. It does not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Rapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. Bacteria\nTypes of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods,  (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. Clostridium sordellii can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. This mainly involves  Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Diagnosis\n\nEarly diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. It also has a 99% chance of ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. Prevention\nNecrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Epidemiology\nNecrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or  bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. Bones, flesh, and sinew (cord, tendon, or nerve) would fall off from the body and there were many deaths\". The first English description for necrotizing soft-tissue infection was by British surgeon Leonard Gillespie and British physicians Gilbert Blaine and Thomas Trotter in the 18th century. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". In 1883, Dr Jean-Alfred Fournier described the necrotizing infection of the perineum and scrotum, now called Fournier gangrene. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it. This...spread across my leg as fast as a Star Trek space disease in time-lapse.\" He got the disease during a trip to Thailand. He suffered an open compound fracture in his lower leg, which became infected.

Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. History\nIn the fifth century BCE, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease where those affected would have \"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. Bones, flesh, and sinew (cord, tendon, or nerve) would fall off from the body and there were many deaths\". The first English description for necrotizing soft-tissue infection was by British surgeon Leonard Gillespie and British physicians Gilbert Blaine and Thomas Trotter in the 18th century. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infections were known variously as \"phagedaenic ulcer\" (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), \"gangrenous phagedena\", \"gangrenous ulcer\", \"malignant ulcer\", \"putrid ulcer\", \"fulminating gangrene\", \"necrotizing erysipelas\", \"gangrenous erysipelas\", \"crepitant cellulitis\", \"gangrenous cellulitis\", \"Meleney cellulitis\", \"necrotizing synergistic cellulitis\", \"hemolytic streptococcal gangrene\", \"progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene\", \"necrotizing abscess\", \"galloping gangrene\", or \"hospital gangrene\". Later, \"hospital gangrene\" became more commonly used. In 1883, Dr Jean-Alfred Fournier described the necrotizing infection of the perineum and scrotum, now called Fournier gangrene. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Despite being disfavored by the medical community, the term \"galloping gangrene\" is frequently used in sensationalistic news media to refer to outbreaks of necrotizing fasciitis. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\". 2009 R. W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it. This...spread across my leg as fast as a Star Trek space disease in time-lapse.\" He got the disease during a trip to Thailand. He suffered an open compound fracture in his lower leg, which became infected.

Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. On 12 May 2016, the FDA issued a drug safety communication advising that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for these conditions only when no other options are available due to potentially permanent, disabling side effects occurring together. The FDA put out another label change in July 2017, strengthening the warnings about potentially disabling adverse effects and limiting use of these drugs to second-line treatments for acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of \"black box\" warnings in the United States. A 2018 EU-wide review of fluoroquinolones concluded that they are associated with serious side effects including tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, \n\n the labels to describe the potential for irreversible peripheral neuropathy (serious nerve damage). In November 2015, an FDA Advisory Committee discussed the risks and benefits of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs based on new safety information. The advisory committee concluded that the serious risks associated with the use of fluoroquinolones for these types of uncomplicated infections generally outweighed the benefits for patients with other treatment options. The 21-member joint \n\n In 2008, the U.S. FDA added black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones, advising of the increased risk of tendon damage. In 2016, the FDA found that systemic use (by mouth or injection) of fluoroquinolones was associated with \"disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects\" involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, concluding that these side effects generally outweigh the benefits for people with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections when other treatment options are available.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

She supported making birth control available to women over the counter. 53% of adults said in a poll by the Pew Research Center that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. However, the Center for Reproductive Rights in its What if Roe Fell website labels the state as hostile towards abortion rights e.g., 20-week ban, telemedicine ban, TRAP requirements, admitting privileges requirement, transfer agreement requirement, reporting requirement, parental consent required, mandatory counseling, mandatory ultrasound and waiting period requirements. There is also an anti-abortion community, much of it centered on religious groups. Protesters were regularly outside Affiliated Medical Services in 2013. There has been some anti-abortion violence, including a bomb attack against a Planned Parenthood clinic in April 2012. Terminology \n\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"induced abortion\" of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense. Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons. Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". Context \nFree birth control correlates to teenage girls having a fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. A 2014 New England Journal of Medicine study found such a link. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states have legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. History\n\nLegislative history \n\nIn 1849, the state legislature passed a law that criminalized abortion, making it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman, no matter the circumstances of her pregnancy. The state was one of 23 states in 2007 to have a detailed abortion-specific informed consent requirement. In 2012, Governor Walker and the Republican controlled legislature repealed the Healthy Youth Act, which required schools to provide students scientifically-accurate and age-appropriate information on contraception as one method to help prevent STIs and unplanned births. However, this was replaced with a requirement for abstinence-only education, in which schools are to teach that \"abstinence is the only reliable way to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually transmitted infections.\" Specifically, requirements under this law require that students are taught the benefits of and reasons for abstinence, as well as the \"positive connection between marriage and parenting.\" In mid-May 2019, state law banned abortion after week 22. Specifically, the legislature passed a measure requiring abortion physicians to provide information on abortion reversal – a procedure that the scientific community sees as illegitimate and invalid, as it is not based upon medically-sound research. In addition, the legislature passed a bill that would eliminate all government funding for Planned Parenthood, as well as a ban on all abortions based upon the race, sex, or genetic anomaly of the fetus. Evers also vetoed a bill that would sentence doctors to life in prison for failing to provide infants with medical care if they are born alive during a botched abortion attempt. Admitting privileges require physicians providing abortion to obtain the right to admit patients at local hospitals – although federal law dictates that no hospital can deny a patient admittance. The state's primary argument in defense of the admitting privileges requirement centers on women's health. Specifically, if complications arise, this requirement presumes a continuity of care for the patient. The court's ruling, however, determined that the remarkably low rates of complications associated with abortion, and the state's failure to impose similar requirements on physicians providing riskier procedures rendered these claims moot. In 2001, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin did not provide any residence related data regarding abortions performed in the state to the Centers for Disease Control.

The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is a strain of coronavirus that leads to the respiratory illness known as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is highly contagious in humans. It is considered the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. It is important to note that the virus has the potential to mutate, and some variants have shown increased infectivity. However, with the emergence of variants, the transmissibility of the virus can vary. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread globally. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin\n\nThe first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification, but it is not its direct ancestor. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Phylogenetics and taxonomy\n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus (which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families) Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses. A distinguishing feature of SARS‑CoV‑2 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence. Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses within the Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, it appears in few other viruses from the Beta-CoV genus, and it is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019. 3,422 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus. In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins. Phylogenetic tree\n\nVariants \n\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades. The World Health Organization has currently declared five variants of concern, which are as follows:\n Alpha: Lineage B.1.1.7 emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence. Virology\n\nStructure\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 virion is  in diameter; its mass within the global human populace has been estimated as being between 0.1 and 1.0 kg. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope. In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion. Genome \nSARS-CoV-2 has a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 30,000 bases long. Its genome has a bias against cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides, like other coronaviruses. The depletion of CG dinucleotides in its genome has led the virus to have a noticeable codon usage bias. A similar codon usage bias trend is seen in other SARS–related coronaviruses. By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS‑CoV‑2. Studies have shown that SARS‑CoV‑2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus. Treatment and drug development \nVery few drugs are known to effectively inhibit SARS‑CoV‑2. However, it is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans as of August 2021. COVID Moonshot is an international collaborative open-science project started in March 2020 with the goal of developing an un-patented oral antiviral drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis from November 2020 estimated the basic reproduction number () of the virus to be between 2.39 and 3.44. This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 2.39 to 3.44 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken. While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear, one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015. Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.

The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin\n\nThe first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS‑CoV‑2. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2. This sequence was the closest known to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of its identification, but it is not its direct ancestor. In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Phylogenetics and taxonomy\n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Like the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS‑CoV‑2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus (which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families) Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses. A distinguishing feature of SARS‑CoV‑2 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence. Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses within the Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, it appears in few other viruses from the Beta-CoV genus, and it is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS‑CoV‑2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019. 3,422 SARS‑CoV‑2 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus. In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS‑CoV‑2 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins. Phylogenetic tree\n\nVariants \n\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades. The World Health Organization has currently declared five variants of concern, which are as follows:\n Alpha: Lineage B.1.1.7 emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence. Virology\n\nStructure\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 virion is  in diameter; its mass within the global human populace has been estimated as being between 0.1 and 1.0 kg. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope. In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion.

The low-grade breast implants produced by the now closed French manufacture Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were made available in nearly all member states with the largest concentration in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. The implants - containing silicone made for use in mattresses - were banned in 2010 but France caused waves in December last year when it issued a cancer alert and advised French women to have the implants removed. The report found that “data available today was insufficient to lead to firm conclusions regarding the health risks for women with PIP silicone breast implants”. The evidence of health risks for women with PIP silicon breast implants, it concluded, is weak. But proven fraud, possible sub-standard screening processes in Europe, and recent revelations that the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) banned the company in 2000 are causing concern among MEPs in the European parliament. PIP obtained a permit for its saline implants in 1997 from the German certification company, TUV Rheinland. The manufacturer declared a medical-grade silicone but instead used an industrial alternative that is around ten times less expensive saving the company around €1.2 million per year, according to Reuters. The FDA issued a warning letter to the company's founder, Jean-Claude Mas, and then banned PIP saline implants in the United States in 2000 after inspecting the manufacturer’s premises in southern France. The FDA agent who inspected the site in 2000 said the implants had been “adulterated”, according to press reports. The same plant in southern France was manufacturing the silicone implants generating the current uproar. Authorities are unable to determine which people received which implants. In Denmark, one clinic closed and destroyed all its documents once it was discovered that it had used some PIP implants. The women treated at the clinic have no idea if they are carrying anyone of the implants classified as potentially dangerous. McAvan is now pushing for a EU-wide system that improves traceability of the implants and wants the commission to implement an EU-level barcode that identifies every item. Euro-MPs are pressing for a ban on breast implants for under-18 year olds as part of an EU-wide campaign for tougher health and safety regulations on silicone gel products. The European Commission has promised to re-write EU legislation on medical devices to avoid a repeat of the breast implant scandal involving French-firm Poly Implant Prothese which emerged last year. After recent implant scandals, revised EU legislation should make medical devices subject to more stringent tests, but health ministers are dragging their feet. as a part of the breast reconstruction process or used cosmetically to augment small breasts. An implant consists of a fluid-filled, malleable pouch that is designed to mimic to the look and feel of natural breast tissue when inserted into a pocket created under the skin in a procedure called a mammoplasty. The ensuing scare resulted in the largest product liability settlement in U.S. history and the Chapter-11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning Corporation, one of the makers of the implants. Despite legal settlements in the billions of dollars, the claims against silicone-filled implants remain anecdotal; numerous scientific studies have found no link or only a weak equivocal link between the implants and disease. The use of silicone-filled implants was again approved by the FDA for reconstructive surgery in 1998 and for cosmetic surgery in 2006. In 2010 silicone-filled implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned after it was discovered that the firm had used industrial-grade, instead of medical-grade, silicone gel. Some countries adopted similar recommendations, while others did not; the implants had not been licensed for use in the United States. A 2012 British report on the PIP implants found that the gel used in them did not constitute a long-term health threat. This study investigated whether breast implants are associated with abnormal ECG recordings. The boss of the French company which distributed the defective breast implants was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud. And despite reports and conjectures showing adverse health impacts of breast implants, there are still women who consider having breast implants,\" the bill's authors noted. There have been roughly 60 cases of ALCL in women with breast implants worldwide, according to the FDA. According to a Dubai-based plastic surgeon, breast implants procedures are much in demand in the UAE. If you have developed problems with your breast implants, or your breast implant surgery has gone wrong, you could be entitled to compensation. PIP implants refer to a type of silicone based breast implant manufactured in France by a company called Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP). Polypropylene breast implants, also known as string breast implants, are a form of breast implant using polypropylene developed by Gerald W. Johnson. Due to a number of medical complications, the device has not been approved in the European Union or the United States. The polypropylene, which is yarn-like, causes irritation to the implant pocket which causes the production of serum which fills the implant pocket on a continual basis. Problems can also \n\nDespite reassurance surrounding the controversial breast implants at the centre of a global health scare, fear is continuing to spread. Israel”s Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk. The decision was prompted by the French Government”s announcement that it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, to have them removed. Theyhave a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from arare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. Ithas also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coatingdesigned to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel. Up to now, there have been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the Middle East, and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in recent weeks. Shesaid ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from theNetherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Maltaand Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. minor masculinising effects, but with one-seventh the intensity of testosterone. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping.

Meningococcemia, another manifestation of meningococcal disease, is a bloodstream infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis. In some cases, meningococcemia can cause blood clotting problems, leading to purpura fulminans, a condition characterized by extensive skin necrosis and organ damage. It is important to note that meningococcal disease can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, so prompt medical attention is crucial. If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms suggestive of meningococcal disease, it is important to seek immediate medical care. While best known as a cause of meningitis, it can also result in sepsis, which is an even more damaging and dangerous condition. It is usually (but not always) associated with Haemophilus influenzae type b. Meningitis involves the inflammation of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Haemophilus meningitis is characterized by symptoms including fever, nausea, sensitivity to light, headaches, stiff neck, anorexia, and seizures. Five to ten percent of cases can be fatal, although the average mortality rate in developing nations is seventeen percent, mostly due to lack of access to vaccination as well as lack of access to medical care needed to combat the meningitis. A child in the presence of family members sick with Haemophilus meningitis or carrying the bacteria is 585 times more likely to catch Haemophilus meningitis. Additionally, siblings of individuals with the Haemophilus influenzae meningitis receive reduced benefits from certain types of immunization. Similarly, children under two years of age have a greater risk of contracting the disease when attending day care, especially in their first month of attendance, due to the maintained contact with other children who might be asymptomatic carriers of the Hib bacteria. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, and Neisseria meningitidis is one of the leading pathogens responsible for this condition. It is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and bloodstream infections. Meningococcal infections can occur at any age, but children, particularly those aged 6 months to 2 years, are more susceptible to this infection. Consequently, environments like daycare centers and schools can facilitate the transmission of the infection. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the symptoms of a Neisseria meningitidis infection, which may include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Vaccination is also available to prevent some types of meningococcal infections, and it is recommended for infants, preteens, and certain high-risk groups. To conclude, Neisseria meningitidis is indeed a significant cause of meningitis, especially in children.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Blood Tests to Diagnose Arthritis. Your doctor will use several different blood tests to help diagnose you with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions. Blood tests are usually fast. They take, or «draw,» blood into several test tubes. Once the rheumatoid factor level reaches a certain range, the patient tests positive for rheumatoid factor. Years ago, doctors used the positive result of rheumatoid factor in a patient’s blood to firmly diagnose them with rheumatoid arthritis. Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medically reviewed by University of Illinois-Chicago, College of Medicine on September 21, 2016 — Written by Jeannette Belliveau. nerve damage or rheumatoid arthritis and given Lyrica. I'm happy for the people that have used New Blood Test Predicts Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk. Such a test would substantially increase the early detection of RA and make treatment more effective. This test is done to assert the condition of the joints and not for any diagnosis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gout are two forms of inflammatory arthritis. Imaging tests can detect a buildup of uric acid crystals around the joints or if there are signs of inflammation Yes. Unfortunately, rheumatoid arthritis is sometimes difficult to detect and diagnose because the symptoms vary from person to person and there is no one definitive test for the disease. Nine out of ten or 90% of people with RA test positive for ACPA and the test is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of arthritis. Similar to RF, a patient may test positive for ACPA even before the signs and symptoms of … Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and other body parts. Lab tests aren’t perfect—you can test … Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the immune system that is designed to protect the body by attacking foreign substances like viruses or bacteria. The normal action of the immune system is affected when the autoimmune disease mistakenly attacks the joints. Medical tests for psoriatic arthritis #5: Rheumatoid factor (RF) Rheumatoid factor is a protein antibody produced by the immune system that attacks healthy tissue. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren syndrome have positive RF tests. The higher the level, the more likely one of these conditions is present. These tests are used to detect specific antibodies, genetic and immune factors, and certain markers (substances that may Rheumatoid arthritis The TMJ is affected in > 17% of adults and children with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is usually among the last joints involved.

An autoantibody is an antibody that is directed against an organism’s own tissues (like in autoimmune diseases). In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, 4 out of 5 people will have RF detectable in their blood. A blood test that measures citrullinated proteins (CPs) could lead to osteoarthritis (OA) diagnoses years before the physical symptoms manifest in patients, according to a recent study. Blood Test Aids Early Detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis A blood test that measures the levels of a certain protein can be used in conjunction with clinical assessments to assist with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is now available in North America. Rheumatoid factor is detected in a simple blood test. Learn more about the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by taking the symptoms quiz. This quiz is intended for patients who have been diagnosed with RA. Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis. Blood tests are frequently used to help in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also to assess any potential problems with the various drugs that are used to treat RA. All tests DNA Testing for Rheumatoid Arthritis. This test cannot be ordered as an individual test but only as a part of the list of diseases included in our Genetic Predisposition Test panel. A blood test is used to detect the presence of rheumatoid factor. The blood test is commonly ordered to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic performance of a point of care test (POCT) for detection of anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with 2 years of disease duration or less. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis involves a series of lab tests and a physical evaluation of symptoms. Testing blood for rheumatoid factor is a common way to help diagnose the disease, however some patients may test negative while arthritic symptoms persist. This support surprisingly comes from a study showing that antibiotics were not helpful for treating symptoms of the more common “wear and tear” arthritis (called osteoarthritis)1. Elevated levels can indicate muscle inflammation and other muscle problems. A combination of drugs is the cornerstone of treatment. Blood test that could predict arthritis risk. Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Test : Principle, Procedure, Interpretation and Clinical Significance. The IsolateFibromyalgia test reportedly provides a highly accurate diagnosis that differentiates fibromyalgia from conditions that it mimics or conditions that would be misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Lyme disease, and lupus. Approximately 88% of people with Ankylosing Spokdylitis test positive for HLA B27. It is important to note that positive HLA B27 results by themselves should not be considered definitive. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate)—This blood test is used to detect inflammation in the body. Higher sed rates indicate the presence of inflammation and are typical of many forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and many of the connective tissue diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the synovium. This leads to an inflammatory immune response that causes pain, joint deformity and disability as it progresses (). Test limitations: Eight percent of Caucasians have a positive HLA-B27, while far less than one percent actually develop arthritis. Can a dexa scan detect arthritis . Suggest treatment for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . In order to facilitate the detection of ACPA in clinical practice, our scientists here at ORGENTEC Diagnostika have used mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) to develop a very effective rapid test for point of care testing (POCT) upon suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis. Sensitive Test Enables Early Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It an effective tool for the rapid and precise routine diagnosis of suspected RA and the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis and the Lung. Authored by Dr Colin Tidy, It is usually associated with severe arthritis and high serum levels of rheumatoid factor. Blood tests for evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, including serology. Respiratory function tests, including spirometry. Your doctor will perform physical examination, evaluate your medical history, order some blood tests (i.e. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR, rheumatoid factor or RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide or anti-CCP antibodies) in order to confirm the diagnosis. A test for rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP), substances made in the blood of children with some forms of JIA. Ancillary tests to detect rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A special blood test can help identify the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. Other tests (blood tests, MRI or CT scans) may be performed if there are red flags, or to confirm or exclude the presence other rare conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as a spinal tumor, infection, fracture, or other types of arthritis. The cause of the disease is not known, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disease (an illness that occurs when the body mistakenly detects its own tissue as foreign and attacks itself). A reliable new blood test can test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) years in advance. With about 1.5 million Americans suffering from the debilitating condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), early detection is key. HealthTap: Doctor answers on Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and More: Dr. Singh on signs of autoimmune diseases with negative blood tests: Routine blood tests do not examine for HIV and may not detect any abnormality due to HIV at two years after exposure. “We have developed a test for measuring the underlying autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis patients that should be used to evaluate new treatment regimens,” says senior author Dr. Gregg Silverman, professor in the Departments of Medicine and Pathology at NYU Langone and co-director of its Musculoskeletal Center of Excellence. Blood Test. A special kind of blood test known as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is carried out to diagnose sarcoid arthritis.. Researchers in Sweden found that so-called \"biologic\" drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or anti-TNFs, slightly reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome -- a condition that includes angina and heart attack in which blood supply to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. In another study, British scientists also found taking these drugs was associated with a lower risk for heart attack in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. The roughly 1.3 million Americans affected by the rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly begins to attack the joints, often suffer from pain, stiffness, swelling, and have trouble moving and using many of their joints. \"It has been known that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a greater risk of developing heart disease than those without,\" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. \"This risk seems to extend in many forms of cardiovascular disorders, among which the most notable is coronary artery disease, but also includes heart failure, peripheral artery disease and possibly stroke.\" In the first study, the Swedish team compared rates of heart disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking anti-TNFs with patients not using the drugs and people in the general population, to see if the medications could also cut the risk for heart issues. The study involved a group of more than 7,700 patients in Sweden with rheumatoid arthritis who had never been diagnosed with heart disease. The study revealed the prevalence of heart events was slightly lower among patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were actively taking anti-TNFs than people with rheumatoid arthritis who had never taken this type of medication. After taking other factors into account, such as how long the patients had rheumatoid arthritis, other diseases affecting the patients and socio-economic status, the researchers found that patients actively on the drugs had a 27 percent lower risk for angina/heart attack than patients who had never taken such a drug. \"This nationwide study adds to the evidence that use of TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis also has an impact on cardiovascular [illness],\" study author Dr. Lotta Ljung, a senior consultant in rheumatology at Umea University Hospital, said in a news release issued by the meeting organizers. A second study conducted by researchers in the UK examined the effects of anti-TNF drugs on patients' risk for heart attacks. They also considered whether the severity of heart attacks was in any way affected by treatment with TNF inhibitors. One examined the safety of biologic drugs, the other examined heart attack-related hospitalizations in England and Wales. \"Better control of inflammation with biologic therapy might reduce not only the rate of heart attacks, but potentially also affect the size of [heart attacks],\" reasoned study co-author Dr. William Dixon a rheumatologist with Arthritis Research UK's Epidemiology Unit at the University of Manchester. The study showed that patients taking anti-TNF drugs were at lower risk for heart attack than patients taking traditional DMARDs. However, use of the biologic drugs did not affect the severity of heart attacks, the British team found. His team pointed out, however, that patients with rheumatoid arthritis generally have an increased risk of heart attacks. So, even though anti-TNFs may help curb the risk for heart attacks they do not eliminate it. The U.K. group conclude that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who taking biologic drugs still need to take steps to cut their risk for heart disease. \"Given that these studies demonstrate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis, patients should try to mitigate other known cardiovascular risk factors by not smoking and maintaining a healthy diet and weight,\" said Dr. Diane Horowitz, a rheumatologist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\nFor his part, Ong said it makes \"sense that drugs that reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis could reduce some of the risk of developing heart disease in these same patients.\" The U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases provides more information on rheumatoid arthritis. of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset. Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Since January 2020,  confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. The January 2022 emergence of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to record highs in hospitalizations and cases, with as many as 1.5 million new infections reported in a single day. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline\n\nDecember 2019 to April 2020\nIn November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was publicly reported, though the All of Us study (released in 2021) showed five states already had cases weeks earlier. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. By the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. May to August 2020\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. On July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), \"the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\". In early October, an unprecedented series of high-profile U.S. political figures and staffers announced they had tested positive for COVID-19. On October 2, Trump announced on Twitter that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19 and would immediately quarantine. Trump was given an experimental Regeneron product with two monoclonal antibodies and taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was given remdesivir and dexamethasone. On the same day, the total number of cases had surpassed ten million while the total had risen by over a million in the ten days prior, averaging 102,300 new cases per day. Pfizer also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine may be up to ninety percent effective. In November, the Trump administration reached an agreement with a number of retail outlets, including pharmacies and supermarkets, to make the COVID-19 vaccine free once available. On December 24, following concerns over a probably more easily transmissible new SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom, later called Alpha, the CDC announced testing requirements for American passengers traveling from the UK, to be administered within 72 hours, starting on December 28. On December 29, the U.S. reported the first case of this variant in Colorado. The patient had no travel history, leading the CDC to say, \"Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected.\" On January 22, the U.S. passed 25million cases, with one of every 13 Americans testing positive for COVID-19. By March 5, more than 2,750 cases of COVID-19 variants were detected in 47 states; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico. Experts began warning against public relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation measures as vaccines continue to be administered, with one, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, warning of a new rise in cases. By April 7, the Alpha variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S. On April 12, the U.S. reported its first cases of a new \"double mutant\" SARS-CoV-2 variant from India, later called Delta, in California. On April 29, the CDC estimated that roughly 35% of the U.S. population had been infected with the virus as of March 2021, about four times higher than the official reported numbers. May to August 2021\nOn May 4, Biden announced a new goal of having 70 percent of all adults in the U.S. receive at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot by July 4, along with steps to vaccinate teenagers and more inaccessible populations. On May 6, a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that the true COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. was more than 900,000 people. On May 9, Dr. Fauci confirmed that the U.S. death toll was likely undercounted. On June 15, the U.S. passed 600,000 deaths, though the number of daily deaths had decreased due to vaccination efforts. By June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant. By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated. The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines. On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron. On February 8, the WHO's director-general announced that a team of international experts had been assembled to travel to China and he hoped officials from the CDC would also be part of that mission. In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed \"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\". From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites.

Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.

On April 11, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths.

In January, Boeing announced a donation of 250,000 medical masks to help address China's supply shortages. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100million pledge to China and other countries to assist with their fights against the virus. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. Health officials are also worried that low-income communities will fall further behind in contact tracing efforts which \"may also be hobbled by long-standing distrust among minorities of public health officials\". Public health officials in California claim that most of the functionality could be duplicated by using text, chat, email, and phone communications. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. A small test in France by researcher Didier Raoult had given positive results, although the study was criticized for design flaws, small sample size, and the fact that it was published before peer review. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, saying the available evidence showed \"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\". From early 2020, more than 70 companies worldwide (with five or six operating primarily in the U.S.) began vaccine research. On November 20, 2020, the Pfizer–BioNTech partnership submitted a request for emergency use authorization for its vaccine to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was granted on December 11. On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted the Moderna vaccine emergency use authorization, which Moderna had requested on November 30, 2020. Starting on December 14, 2020, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. In February 2020, similar numbers of Democrats and Republicans believed COVID-19 was \"a real threat\": 70% and 72%, respectively. By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed. A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. 57% felt the federal government was not doing enough to address the limited availability of COVID-19 testing. 58% felt the federal government was not doing enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 cases later in 2020. Concurrent searches for both low-cost and premium products, and a shift to safety over sustainability, occurred alongside rescinded bans and taxes on single-use plastics, and losses of three to seven years of gains in out-of-home foodservice. From the earliest days of the pandemic, there were reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates. CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States. The COVID Tracking Project published data revealing that people of color were contracting and dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites.

Until August to September 2021, many companies were giving bonuses for getting vaccinated. Nonetheless, nearly 2,000 private hospitals and health systems had previously issued vaccine mandates. Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors. With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates. According to the Global Health Security Index, an American-British assessment which ranks the health security capabilities in 195 countries, the U.S. was the \"most prepared\" nation in 2020.

Humira is an immune-suppressing drug that reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation. It has shown promising results in a phase 3 trial, where patients with uveitis who were treated with Humira experienced longer intervals between flare-ups compared to those who received an inactive placebo. However, it is important to note that Humira does carry an increased risk of infections, and patients need to be screened for tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis before taking the drug. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment option for managing chronic eye inflammation. Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. For example, the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen (paracetamol) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. WEDNESDAY, Sept. 7, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis may be able to keep the condition at bay with the immune-suppressing drug Humira (adalimumab), a new study finds. The current standard treatment for uveitis is corticosteroids. But this treatment comes with a significant risk of side effects, the researchers said. Humira reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation, Jaffe said. One concern with Humira is an increased chance of infections. For this phase 3 trial, Jaffe and colleagues randomly assigned more than 200 patients with uveitis to Humira or an inactive placebo. Among those taking Humira, the average time to a flare-up with the condition was 24 weeks, compared with 13 weeks for those taking the placebo, the investigators found. According to Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"Humira effectively achieved disease control after stopping steroid treatment.\" \"Further investigation into alternative therapies for uveitic disease is necessary to attempt to save the sight of the many patients that suffer from this sight-threatening group of diseases,\" Fromer said.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. After confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC. The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the region, it did not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC. Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHEIC was that the \n\n The Western African Ebola virus epidemic took more than 11,000 lives. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus \n\nMeanwhile, WHO has been given the go-ahead by officials in the DRC to import and use an experimental Ebola vaccine in the country, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \"The Senate is disturbed that recent reports by media outlets and the World Health Organisation show that the disease is back in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo with 19 dead and 39 infected recorded so far\". The Africa CDC will dispatch a team on Wednesday to the DRC to assess the situation and the level of support required to ongoing efforts by DRC and other partners to contain the outbreak, said John Nkengasong, Director of Africa CDC, during a press briefing on Tuesday at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms. It was tested in Guinea in 2015. WHO is working with Congo's government and other global organizations, including Medecins Sans Frontieres, to strengthen coordination to fight and contain the Ebola outbreak. and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

According to John Demsey, executive group president of the brand’s parent company Estée Lauder, “It is so important for people of all ages, all races and all genders to get the accurate information and care they need so they can live their best, healthiest lives, but we see that a lot of people aren’t seeking that information and care because of stigmas that disproportionately affect women, people of color and the LGBTQ community .”\n\nLess than one percent of women getting a medication-induced abortion at Planned Parenthood had a serious side effect or a failed abortion, according to a new study. “At Planned Parenthood, medical abortion is extremely safe,” said reproductive health researcher James Trussell from Princeton University in New Jersey, who worked on the study. Of the 233,805 abortions during the study period, 385 women had a serious side effect, including 238 who sought ER treatment, 135 who were admitted to the hospital, 114 who had a blood transfusion and 57 who required intravenous antibiotics. One limitation, the study team noted, is that not all women checked back after the abortion or had follow up medical records available - so it’s possible more complications could have occurred that weren’t recorded. Planned Parenthood staff members were required to make three attempts to reach any patients who didn’t return for follow up visits under the organization’s medical standards and guidelines. “We assume that if anything had happened, that people would get back in touch with Planned Parenthood,” Trussell told Reuters Health. Two of the study’s authors are Planned Parenthood employees, and Trussell is a member of the National Medical Committee of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The medication regimen used by Planned Parenthood - and many other abortion providers - is slightly different than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug course because it includes lower doses of mifepristone and at-home use of misoprostol. Medical abortions done at Planned Parenthood run for about $300 to $800, according to its website. “Mandating the FDA-approved regimen, without a scientific basis, does not protect patients from unsafe abortion; it only limits access to safe and effective medical abortion for women desiring a pregnancy termination,” they concluded. In 2012, Gardner co-sponsored the controversial so-called \"personhood\" legislation titled the Life Begins at Conception Act. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. The paper, published in JAMA Cardiology, found that the rate of abortion for babies with major congenital heart disease (CHD) increased from 0.6% in 1996 to 39.1% in 2013 – a 65 fold increase. The rate is particularly high for some conditions – in the case of fetuses diagnosed with single ventricle defects (such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the most severe form of CHD), roughly 85% of pregnancies ended in abortion. Denmark began offering universal prenatal screening free of charge in 2004, and is already known to have a very high abortion rate for babies with Down’s syndrome. The last statement by Dr. Kon, that women who are not white may get more pressure to commit infanticide, is yet another evidence that indicates that eugenics never went away, but really is stronger today than it ever has been. Back in the first half of the 20th century, they were not pushing women to have abortions, but they were sterilizing people — which is still evil. Last year, Planned Parenthood Southeast president, Staci Fox, admitted that the majority of the babies slaughtered in Planned Parenthood offices are minority babies. So Planned Parenthood specifically targets minorities to murder their children because it wants to eradicate their populations. There are numerous operatives who present themselves as “liberal” and as “against racism” while they lobby for Planned Parenthood. For example, Tim Wise, a Jewish American ‘anti-racist’ operative, will say many things against racism, but he will defend Planned Parenthood. But both back eugenics, while using their words against racism and Islam as a way to cover up their true motivations. While people like Ben Shapiro, Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and Robert Spencer all are part of the Counter-jihad crown, they both have pushed for policies that back the jihad. They say they are against racism, so as to get you to follow them as they advance racism. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Concerns about long-term safety recurred with the report of a possible association between prostate cancer and vasectomy (309). It is extremely likely that normal couples will experience at least one unwanted pregnancy at some time during their reproductive years. As a result, abortion is common. While there was a decline in the overall number of abortions worldwide from 46 million in 1995 to 42 million in 2003, this decline was greater in developed than in developing countries. About half of induced abortions are illegal and considered “unsafe” by the World Health Organization definition: procedures carried out either by an unskilled person or in unsafe conditions or both (313,314). As shown in Table 10.9 total abortion rates are quite similar over much of the world. What differs is the rate of safe abortions compared with unsafe abortions. In the developed countries, unsafe abortions are rare. The highest rates of unsafe abortion are in Latin America and Africa, where abortion is generally illegal. per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" The World Health Organization (WHO) defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities. Legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine. In the United States as of 2012, abortion was estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth. CDC estimated in 2019 that US pregnancy-related mortality was 17.2 maternal \n\nThe cumulative probability of failure was 7.4 per 1,000 procedures at 1 year and 11.3 at year 5, and comparable to the failure rate of tubal sterilization (281).The best long-term information comes from the CREST study.In addition, not all pregnancies after vasectomy can be attributed to the men who had the operation.The best answer available comes from the CREST study (302). A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. Vasectomy is a highly effective method. Vasectomy is not effective until all sperm are cleared by the reproductive tract. A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, \"I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life.\" He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, \"a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist’s child\". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as \"pro-life, with exceptions\". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”\n\nAbortion in Kansas is legal. The state has seen anti-abortion rights violence, including the kidnapping of a doctor in 1982 and the killing of Doctor George Tiller in 2009. Pro-life advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The terms \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" are examples of terms labeled as political framing: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light. The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". Context \n\nFree birth control correlates to teenage girls having fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states with legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. Some states, including Kansas, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to warn patients of a link between abortion and breast cancer, and to issue other scientifically unsupported warnings. The bill was known as House Bill 2324, \"An act prohibiting an abortion of an unborn human individual with a detectable fetal heartbeat.\" Kansas lawmakers approved sweeping anti-abortion legislation (HB 2253) on April 6, 2013, that says life begins at fertilization, forbids abortion based on gender and bans Planned Parenthood from providing sex education in schools. In April 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, and ruled that the right to abortion is inherent within the state's constitution and bill of rights, such that even if Roe v. Wade is overturned and the federal protection of abortion rights is withdrawn, the right would still be allowed within Kansas, barring a change in the state constitution. The Value Them Both Amendment would overturn the 2019 Kansas Supreme Court ruling, stating that \"the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion\" (SCR 1613). (HCR 5003)\n\nThe full text of the Value Them Both Amendment states: \"Because Kansans value both women and children, the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion. To the extent permitted by the constitution of the United States, the people, through their elected state representatives and state senators, may pass laws regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, in circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or when necessary to save the life of the mother.\" (HCR 5003)The ballot would include the following explanation:\"The Value Them Both Amendment would affirm there is no Kansas constitutional right to abortion or to require the government funding of abortion, and would reserve to the people of Kansas, through their elected state legislators, the right to pass laws to regulate abortion, including, but not limited to, in circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, or when necessary to save the life of the mother. A vote for the Value Them Both Amendment would affirm there is no Kansas constitutional right to abortion or to require the government funding of abortion, and would reserve to the people of Kansas, through their elected state legislators, the right to pass laws to regulate abortion. A vote against the Value Them Both Amendment would make no changes to the constitution of the state of Kansas, and could restrict the people, through their elected state legislators, from regulating abortion by leaving in place the recently recognized right to abortion.\" In 1983's Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City v. Ashcroft, the US Supreme Court said the state could require two doctors be present when a third-trimester abortion was being performed and that the abortion providers for third-trimester abortions could be required to submit a pathology report to the state. In 2017, there were two Planned Parenthood clinics, both of which offered abortion services, in a state with a population of 644,117 women aged 15–49. In 2013, Julie Burkhart opened a clinic in Wichita called Trust Women Wichita, part of Trust Women Foundation. Burkhart was a colleague of the murdered Dr. George Tiller, and by 2013 she had taken over Tiller's clinic following his murder. Statistics \nIn the period between 1972 and 1974, there were zero recorded illegal abortion deaths in the state. In 2014, 49% of adults said in a poll of 307 Kansans by the Pew Research Center that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. In 2016, Fort Hays State University's Kansas Speaks survey reported from a sample size of 1,043 that 26% of respondents opposed abortion in all situations, 38% were in favor of abortion is some situations, 8% were in favor of abortion in most situations, and 29% said abortion should be permitted for any woman that chooses it. In a 2018-Midterms Voter Analysis by Fox News, using survey data from the National Opinion Research Center and The Associated Press with 929 respondents, 19% of those surveyed said abortion should be legal in all cases, 35% said abortion should be legal in most cases, 32% said abortion should be illegal in most cases, and 14% said abortion should be illegal in all cases. In the same analysis, with 3,905 respondents, 4% said abortion was the most important issue facing the country, of which in the Kansas gubernatorial election, 82% voted for Republican candidate Kris Kobach, 14% voted for Democratic candidate Laura Kelley, 2% voted for independent candidate Greg Orman, and 2% voted for another candidate. Violence \nIn August 1982, three men identifying as the Army of God kidnapped Hector Zevallos, a doctor and clinic owner, and his wife, Rosalee Jean, holding them for eight days and released them unharmed. In 1993, Shelly Shannon, an Army of God member, admitted to the attempted murder of Dr. George Tiller. Law enforcement officials found the Army of God Manual, a tactical guide to arson, chemical attacks, invasions, and bombings buried in Shelly Shannon's backyard. Dr. George Tiller was shot and killed by Scott Roeder on May 31, 2009, as Tiller served as an usher at a church in Wichita, Kansas.

At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. The device, which Kimmel accurately likens to a sonogram of the heart, was developed with experimental research using animals. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive. Each will likely require a cardiopulmonary bypass—which mimics heart and lung function for the duration of surgery, keeping the patient alive. The device is an adaptation of early “heart-lung machines;” among the first iterations was a model created in the 1920s by research with canines. Thanks to the skill and expertise of pediatric cardiologists, working with cutting edge science and medicine developed through animal research, more than 63,000 children have been given a new chance at life with successful heart transplants. Many thousands more, including Kimmel’s son, have been successfully diagnosed and treated thanks to research performed with animal models. Last year we shared the emotional story of Lincoln Seay, an infant who survived open-heart surgery and a heart transplant after he was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. Manifestations of the condition vary, but, as in the case with Tetralogy of Fallot, it is often associated with cyanosis. Like many pediatric cardiologists, Lincoln’s surgeons faced challenges that make their success all the more remarkable: the seven-month-old went into cardiac arrest as they waited for the donor organ needed for his transplant—which necessitated an emergency surgery to compress his heart. This, followed by the transplantation, is especially tough on the tiny body of an infant patient. It’s not easy for family members in the waiting room, either. All over the world, scientists and researchers rely on animal models to discover more about how to detect and treat congenital heart defects—offering infants like Lincoln, and Kimmel’s son, a second chance at life. The innovations in medical devices and surgical techniques that result from this work have enabled healthcare providers to perform magic, one baby’s beating heart at a time. He was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. Kimmel was a member of Temple Emanu-El in New York City. Kimmel died April 15, 2008. first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son's birth were cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF. Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. The injections are given directly into the area of the spine affected. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. Some may, therefore, require surgery, with some requiring the disc to be removed. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica. Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though the use of such medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve \n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain. Nowadays, radiofrequency (RF) is one of the most effective options for treatment. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN in a shorter duration compared with CRF. The rapid and correct diagnosis is very important to determine prompt institution of treatment because the symptoms are so severe. For patients in whom medical treatment fails to control pain, microvascular decompression, glycerol rhizolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and percutaneous trigeminal microdecompression procedures have been used in an attempt to alleviate ITN . When the pharmacological treatment fails, a choice between minimally invasive technique and a surgical approach should be made. By far, one of the most common procedures to treat pain is the use of radiofrequency (RF) lesioning. The main advantages of RF seem to be its effectiveness and high pain relief rate without the dangerous complications of surgical procedures  and lack of secondary effects and reduction of oral medication . Lesioning using RF current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing 'thermocoagulation' of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat . RF thermocoagulation has become the most common procedure for treating TN. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy have a lower risk for recurrence but a higher risk for complications requiring hospitalization . The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus PRF in the treatment of ITN pain. All procedures were performed in the operating room. After the stimulation period, the patient was given 1 μg/kg fentanyl and 1–2 mg/kg propofol. Trial stimulation:First, sensory stimulation at 100 Hz was performed with 0.1–0.5 V to search for a tingling sensation at the affected branch, which is the trigeminal nerve branch innervating the trigger zone. We continued to lesion in 5°C increments for 60 s until we reached a maximum of 80°C for 60 s. At each stage, the patient was allowed to recover from the intravenous propofol, and we tested for reduction of response to pinprick stimulation. In the PRF group, a PRF current at a dose of 500 pulses was given to the affected branch, and then we tested the affected area for severity of pain. If the pain was still present, we gave another pulsed dose, and then we examined for pain relief until we covered beyond the trigger area and did not exceed a temperature of 42°C. Patients were evaluated as regards their pain intensity using VAS, patient satisfaction using Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS), the need for additional pharmacological treatment, side effects, complications, and the need for repeating the use of RF treatment. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the presence of complications on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF on the first day, at first week, at first month, and at 3 months after treatment. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF at 6 months after treatment [Table 3]. Pain recurrence after one or more surgical operations is also frequently seen. Surgical and interventional procedures include glycerol injection, percutaneous balloon microdecompression, rhizotomy, thermocoagulation with RF, microvascular decompression, and gamma knife radiosurgery, all of which may be necessary when other treatments fail, but have different surgical risks . As regards pain relief, there was a significant improvement in VAS in both groups throughout the follow-up period; follow-up was scheduled on the first day, at first week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. stated that thermocoagulation offers the highest rates of complete pain relief; this is in agreement with the present study, as we found a highly significant difference in VAS scores at different time points of follow-up compared with pretreatment results. This is nearly the same with respect to patient satisfaction in the present study, as patients were satisfied in both groups until the 6 months Less satisfaction was observed in the PRF group; this may be due to the temporary effects of PRF on the nerve rather than the permanent changes caused by CRF. On comparing the studied groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. We needed repetition of the procedure for 12 patients in the PRF group after 6 months of follow-up; Fraioli and colleagues repeated the procedure in 10 patients. This is different from our results as there were statistical differences between the two groups at 6 months, which may be due to the use of PRF for 10 min and in a pulsed manner for 2 min only. The VAS scores decreased in only two of 20 patients from the PRF group (group 2) and these two patients had achieved considerable pain relief after the procedure. The pain relief lasted 3 months and pain recurrence occurred after 3 months of the procedure. Overall, there was greater satisfaction in the CRF group compared with the PRF group at 6-month follow-up, but without statistical significance. Supervisor of the study decided to perform CRF in group 2, because they still had pain. In present study, we found that there was a need for repetition of the procedure after 6 months for only two patients in the CRF group and 12 patients in the PRF group, which showed high statistical difference between the two groups. The results of Erdine and colleagues are in agreement with our results as no complications were observed in the intraoperative period or in the early postoperative period. After the procedures, as a side effect, five of 20 patients from group 1 and three of 20 patients from group 2 reported moderate headache for 24 h. In all patients from group 1, there was mild hypoesthesia and parasthesias after the procedure. Anesthesia dolorosa occurred in one patient and medical treatment was given. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN. Unlike CRF, this is associated with neuritis-like reactions and motor deficits, whereas PRF seems to have transient side effects.

The study included 128 patients who had not responded to conservative treatment for their back pain. These patients underwent CT-guided pRF, which delivers energy pulses to the root of the nerve for 10 minutes. In comparison, another group of 120 participants received CT-guided steroid injections without pRF. Patients who received pulsed radiofrequency reported improvements in pain and disability scores. They also experienced quicker relief from leg pain and perceived faster recovery times. Based on these results, the researchers suggest offering pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disks and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy. This can be an attractive alternative to more invasive treatments, such as surgery or corticosteroid injections. Pulsed radiofrequency treatment is relatively non-invasive, only lasting 10 minutes, and a single session was sufficient for many patients in the study. In summary, the study on CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency as a treatment for back pain from lumbar disk herniation demonstrated favorable outcomes, including improved pain and disability scores, faster leg pain relief, and quicker perceived recovery times. This approach may offer benefits to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments and could potentially help them avoid invasive surgery or corticosteroid injections.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A teratogen is an agent such as drugs, medications, infections, or chemicals causing birth defects or harm to a fetus. Zofran, an antiemetic medication, is potentially linked to birth defects including cleft lip, cleft palate, and congenital heart defect (CHD). If you took Zofran during your first trimester of pregnancy, and have a child with birth defects, contact us for a free case consultation. The complaint is filed on behalf of a little boy who was born with Supraventricular Tachycardia,or SVT, a serious heart birth defect. In the lawsuit, Mr. Kershaw and Mr. Talley allege the child’s birth defect was suffered after his mother took Zofran, also known as Ondansetron, during her first trimester of pregnancy. According to the filing, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran, off-label, to alleviate morning sickness she experienced in the early weeks of her pregnancy. The complaint alleges the little boy’s SVT was the direct result of exposure to Zofran in utero. A frequently asked question from potential clients is, “Do I have a Zofran case?” As you may know, Zofran is linked to various birth defects. Typically, in these cases, the mother took Zofran during her first trimester of pregnancy and her child is born with a birth defect(s). The other factor to take into consideration is the type of birth defect. Right now, there is limited research and scientific data connecting Zofran use during pregnancy with birth defects. So, if you just discovered the link between Zofran and birth defects, the statute would start to run from the date of that discovery. If a defendant is intentionally concealing a link between a drug and a birth defect, that concealment or fraud can “toll” the statute of limitations. So, if you took Zofran and have a child with a birth defect, it’s very important to call an attorney immediately. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Mar 24, 2015 | Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? This was first evidenced by the thalidomide tragedy during the post-war era of the 1960’s. Thalidomide was a sleeping pill and tranquilizer marketed as safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it was anything but safe for the fetus. Severe birth defects secondary to Thalidomide prompted the start of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) drug approval and monitoring systems. According to The Thalidomide Tragedy: Lessons for Drug Safety and Regulation, “They advertised their product as “completely safe” for everyone, including mother and child, “even during pregnancy,” as its developers “could not find a dose high enough to kill a rat.” This is analogous with GlaxoSmithKline and their advertising of Zofran as safe during pregnancy. Additionally, reproduction studies testing Zofran and it’s teratogenic effects were only performed on pregnant rabbits and rats, much like thalidomide. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.” The ramifications from a lack of testing on human subjects was substantiated with thalidomide. It’s ironic how the thalidomide tragedy catalyzed the FDA’s rigorous drug testing standards yet these standards don’t appear to have been applied to Zofran. Around the 1960’s, it was discovered thalidomide also alleviated morning sickness. It was subsequently prescribed for off-label use in pregnant patients. In the U.S. today, Zofran is prescribed off-label to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. And similar to Thalidomide, it may cause birth defects. So, how do drugs like Zofran cause birth defects? In the case of Thalidomide, it was discovered that thalidomide caused malformations by interacting with the DNA of the dividing embryonic cells. In other words, the dosage’s rate of transfer from the mother’s blood stream to the unborn child is significant. Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? On March 17th, a ValleyNewsLive.com segment reported on a North Dakota woman treated with Zofran, the antiemetic, during her pregnancy. In 2014, Dr. Gideon Koren of the The Motherisk Program of Toronto, Canada released a study detailing fetal safety concerns regarding Zofran. This is only the latest of several reports raising awareness about the link between Zofran and significant birth defects. We continually follow developments regarding Zofran and it’s association with birth defects as part of our firm’s ongoing investigation into this matter. We currently evaluate potential Zofran cases on behalf of families whose child was allegedly born with a birth defect secondary to in utero exposure to this drug. Mothers, Cheri Flynn and Tomisha LeClair, were unaware there was a risk of birth defects when they took Zofran, an anti-emetic, for morning sickness during their pregnancies. The physicians prescribing Zofran were also unaware of these risks. However, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturers of Zofran, knew about the potential chance of birth defects, and illegally marketed and promoted the drug to physicians as safe for use in pregnant women. Therefore, doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but GlaxoSmithKline cannot legally promote those uses. Ms. Flynn and Ms. LeClair filed product liability lawsuits against GlaxoSmithKline in February 2015. They both claim Zofran (Ondansetron) use during their respective pregnancies caused severe birth defects in their children. The respective lawsuits assert GlaxoSmithKline failed to warn consumers and medical professionals of the link between Zofran (Ondansetron) and an elevated risk of congenital heart defects, cleft lip and cleft palate. Ms. Flynn took Zofran during two of her pregnancies. Her complaint alleges taking Zofran during her pregnancies caused congenital heart defects in her children who were born in 2004 and 2006; Ms. LeClair claims her daughter suffers from heart malformations and a permanent developmental delay secondary to Zofran (Ondansetron) use during her pregnancy. This is not GlaxoSmithKline’s first time falsely misleading the public. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for promoting and marketing Zofran for off-label uses to doctors. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Doctors may legally prescribe Zofran “off-label” to pregnant women but the manufacturers of Zofran cannot promote those uses. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) manufactures Zofran. They directly promoted and marketed Zofran for off-label uses (i.e. This is illegal. In 2012, the United States government actually sued GlaxoSmithKline for these illegal practices. The lawsuit explicitly stated, “GSK knowingly: (a) promoted the sale and use of Zofran for a variety of conditions other than those for which its use was approved as safe and effective by the FDA (including hyperemesis or pregnancy-related nausea); (b) made and/or disseminated unsubstantiated and/or false representations or statements about the safety and efficacy of Zofran; and (c) offered and paid illegal remuneration to health care professionals to induce them to promote and prescribe Zofran.” GSK plead guilty and eventually paid a $3 Billion fine in order to resolve fraud allegations and failure to report safety data. The failure to report safety data refers to the fact that Zofran has never been adequately tested and determined safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, most major birth defects occur within the first trimester. The researchers found an increased risk of obstructive defects of the renal pelvis and ureter (tube expelling urine from kidneys). Additionally, there was a 20% increased risk of a major birth defect among children exposed to ondansetron (Zofran) in the first trimester. If Congenital Heart Defect, what type? Both the United States and the state of Tennessee alleged that, from September 2008 through January 2010, the Antioch, Tenn.-based company submitted false claims to Medicare and TennCare for diabetes testing supplies, vacuum erection devices and heating pads. Prior to learning of the United States' and Tennessee's investigation, AmMed disclosed to the Medicare Administrative Contractors its failure to refund monies for returned supplies and began paying the refunds to Medicare \n\nA lawsuit was filed in California on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a heart defect. A lawsuit has been filed in California Superior Court on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during early pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a severe heart defect. According to court documents, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran (generic: ondansetron) for morning sickness during her first trimester of pregnancy. The complaint alleges the defect was the direct and proximate result of the baby’s exposure to Zofran in the womb. According to the suit, plaintiff Cheri Flynn’s first child was born prematurely in 2004, and subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac septal defect (“hole in the heart”) and significant developmental delays. Plaintiff alleges she took Zofran for morning sickness during both pregnancies. All of the complaints cite much of the same evidence to support their allegations, including studies linking Zofran to heart defects, orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations. Plaintiffs also accuse the company of illegally marketing Zofran to treat morning sickness, when the drug has never been approved for such an indication. September 1 – Lawsuit filed today in the Central District of California by a mother who blames GSK for failing to warn about the risk of birth defects from Zofran. Plaintiff asserts that she has no family history of neural tube defects, and that her daughter’s problems are the result of exposure to Zofran in the womb. September 29 – An Alameda County couple filed a lawsuit today in San Francisco federal court alleging that the mother’s use of Zofran during pregnancy caused their daughter to be born with severe heart damage that required open heart surgery. November 6 – A man and wife from Florida filed suit against GSK today in a federal court in San Francisco alleging that the woman’s use of Zofran for morning sickness during pregnancy caused their son to be born with a bilateral cleft lip and cleft palate. The boy underwent his first medical intervention within weeks of being born and had has first surgery before the age of one year, yet continues to suffer developmental delays and problems with eating, drinking and hearing, according to the complaint.

They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June. Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

(CDC; US Congress; CSPAN video/6:00; 12 March 2020)\n\nCOVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus\nDetection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Samples can be obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab, sputum (coughed up material), throat swabs, deep airway material collected via suction catheter or saliva. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests \nIsothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies' potency and protective period have not been established. Genetic tests verify infection earlier than antibody tests. A plate is coated with a viral protein, such as a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. SARS-CoV-2, are neutralized by the blocking of steps in the replicative cycle up to and including membrane fusion. It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages. A study of 175 recovered patients in China who experienced mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had no detectable NAbs at discharge, or thereafter. An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, viruses such as HIV can evade NAb responses. Other tests\n\nSniff tests \nSudden loss of smell can be used to screen people on a daily basis for COVID-19. A study by the National Institutes of Health showed that those infected with SARS-CoV-2 could not smell a 25% mixture of ethanol and water. Health care bureaucracies have generally ignored sniff tests even though they are quick, easy and capable of being self-administered daily. This has led some medical journals to write editorials supporting the adoption of sniff testing. A not negative result is followed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) test. Breath tests\nThe breath test by a Coronavirus breathalyzer is a pre-screening test for people who have no or mild symptoms of COVID-19. Animals\nIn May 2021, Reuters reported that Dutch researchers at Wageningen University had shown that trained bees could detect the virus in infected samples in seconds and this could benefit countries where test facilities are in short supply. History\n\nIn January 2020, scientists from China published the first genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 via GISAID, a program that normally handled genetic sequence data. Researchers around the world used that data to build molecular tests for the virus. Even once the first tests were created, the supply was limited. The WHO and other experts called for ramping up testing as the best way to slow the spread of the virus. Shortages of reagent and other testing supplies became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US. Early tests also encountered problems with reliability. Drive-through centers helped South Korea accelerate its testing program. Home collection \n\nIn Hong Kong test subjects can stay home and receive a specimen tube. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample was positive. Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1122 patient samples using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers. Required volume \nRequired testing levels are a function of disease spread. The more the cases, the more tests are needed to manage the outbreak. If properly targeted testing grows more rapidly than cases, it can be contained. WHO recommends increasing testing until fewer than 10% are positive in any given jurisdiction. Romer also claimed that high test accuracy is not required if tests are administered frequently enough. He ran model simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day using a test with a 20% false negative rate and a 1% false positive rate. Those who tested positive would go into quarantine. The significant reduction resulted from a set of complementary lockdown and quarantine measures whereby citizens who tested positive were quarantined synchronously the weeks afterwards. Such aggregative testing may have detected early cases. Studies show that wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential for an early warning system and monitoring for COVID-19 infections. This may prove particularly useful once large shares of regional populations are vaccinated or recovered and don't need to conduct rapid tests while in some cases being infectious nevertheless. PowerChek Coronavirus looks for the \"E\" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with \"fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons\". Primerdesign offers its Genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19). Cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay runs on the Cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Antigen tests\n\nQuidel's \"Sofia2 SARS Antigen FIA\" is a lateral flow test that uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test was never approved for use in the United States, but was being sold by the company anyway. The FDA inspected Innova facilities in California in March and April 2021, and found inadequate quality assurance of tests manufactured in China. The FDA warned consumers to return or destroy the devices because the rate of false positives and false negatives found in clinical trials were higher than the rate claimed by the packaging. Over 1 billion tests from the company have been distributed in the UK, with £3 billion in funding as part of Operation Moonshot, and the MHRK has authorized exceptional use until at least 28 August 2021. Concerned experts pointed out that accuracy dropped significantly when screening was conducted by the public instead of by a medical professional, and that the test was not designed to screen asymptomatic people. Private US labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp offer antibody testing upon request. Quotient Limited developed a CE marked antibody test that also received an US FDA Emergency Use Authorization. A summary review in BMJ has noted that while some \"serological tests … might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care [than RT-PCR]\", and such testing can identify previously infected individuals, \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\". Even relatively high sensitivity rates can produce high rates of false negatives in populations with low incidence rates. Testing 100 people at random using a test that has a specificity of 95% would yield on average 5 people who are actually negative who would incorrectly test positive. Causes of test error \n\nThe time course of infection affects the accuracy of some tests. Samples may be collected before the virus has had a chance to establish itself or after the body has begun to eliminate it. A cycle threshold of 20 cycles would be adequate to detect SARS-Cov-2 in a highly infective person. A Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation compared 7 PCR kits. Test kits made by BGI, R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical and Seegene showed high sensitivity. High sensitivity kits are recommended to assess people without symptoms, while lower sensitivity tests are adequate when diagnosing symptomatic patients. The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives via RT-PCR after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\", and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\". On 7 September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Another study rejected the test in their clinical setting because of this low sensitivity. Confirmatory testing\n\nThe WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing. National responses\n\nIceland \nIceland managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. India\n\nItaly\nResearchers tested the entire population of Vò, the site of Italy's first COVID‑19 death. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms. All discovered cases were quarantined. Along with restricting travel to the commune, new infections were eliminated. Japan \n\nUnlike other Asian countries, Japan did not experience a pandemic of SARS or MERS, so the country's PCR testing system was not well developed. Japan preferentially tested patients with severe illness and their close contacts at the beginning. Japan's Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting chose cluster measures to identify infections clusters. The Expert Meeting analyzed the outbreak from Wuhan and identified conditions leading to clusters (closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact), and asked people to avoid them. In January, contact tracers took action shortly after the first infection was found. Private companies began to test, and the test system gradually expanded. On 3 April, those with positive tests were legally permitted to recuperate at home or in a hotel if they had asymptomatic or mild illness, ending the hospital bed shortage. The first wave (from China) was contained, but a second wave (caused by returnees from Europe and the US) in mid-March led to spreading infection in April. On 13 May, antigen test kits became covered by insurance, and were combined with a PCR test for  diagnosis. Japan's PCR test count per capita remained far smaller than in some other countries even though its positive test rate was lower. The Expert Meeting stated, \"The Japanese health care system originally carries out pneumonia surveillance, allowing it to detect most of the severely ill patients who develop pneumonia. In that sense, it meets the same standards as other countries that mainly carry out PCR tests.\" On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, many people who initially tested negative later tested positive. As of 18 July, Japan's daily PCR testing capacity was about 32,000, more than three times the 10,000 cases as of April. The number of tests per 1,000 people in the United States is about 27 times that of Japan, the UK is 20 times, Italy is 8 times, and South Korea is twice (as of 26 July). The number of those infected with coronavirus and inpatients has increased in July, but the number of serious cases has not increased. In April, the number of tests could not catch up with the increase in the number of infected people, and the test standards were strict, so the test positive rate exceeded 30% at the peak. It means that there were quite a few cases where the those infected was not PCR tested. In other words, it became possible to grasp the actual situation of infection much better than before by strengthening the testing system. At the end of July, accommodation facilities for mild and asymptomatic carriers became full, and the authorities requested hospitals to prepare beds for the mild. Russia\n\nOn 27 April 2020, Russia tested 3 million people and had 183,000 positive results. On 28 April Anna Popova, head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) stated that 506 laboratories were testing; that 45% of those who tested positive had no symptoms; that 5% of patients had a severe form; and 40% of infections were from family members. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors, finding 20% immunity. Singapore\n\nWith contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, Singapore arrested the initial spread without complete lockdown. The government considered the mass test would significantly assist in controlling the virus and avoid a lockdown and may repeat the exercise at a later date. South Korea \n\nSouth Korea's broad testing approach helped reduce spread. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government in the early 2000s. They performed PCR tests and managed mild patients. Korea's 10k PCR tests per million residents was the world's highest as of 13 April rising to 20k by mid-June.

Twenty-seven Korean companies exported test kits worth $48.6 million in March, and were asked to provide test kits or humanitarian assistance by more than 120 countries. Korean authorities set up a treatment center to isolate and manage patients with asymptomatic and minor illnesses in one facility in order to vacate hospital beds for the more severely ill.\n\nCenters were sited mainly at national facilities and corporate training centers. The failure of Korea's MERS quarantine in May 2015 left Korea more prepared for COVID-19 than countries that did not face that pandemic. Korea already had a system for isolating, testing and treating infectious disease patients separately from others. Patients with respiratory illness but no epidemiological relevance were treated at the National Hospital, and those with epidemiological relevance were treated at selected clinics. Korea established a large scale drive-through/walk-through\" test testing program. However, the most common method was \"mobile examination\". In Daegu City, 54% of samples were collected by 23 March in home or hospital. Collecting samples door-to-door of avoided the risk of travel by possibly infected patients, but required additional staff. Taiwan \nHealth insurance IDs and national identification card numbers were used to trace contacts. United States\n\nNew York State \nNew York State's control measures consisted of PCR tests, stay-at-home measures and strengthening the healthcare system. On 29 February before its first case, the state allowed testing at the Wordsworth Center. On 21 March New York City health officials directed medical providers to test only those entering the hospital, for lack of PPE. Five infected sailors who completed quarantine subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive. Nevada\nIn 2020, Nevada received a donation of 250,000 Covid testing kits, which were a product of China's leading genetics company, BGI Group. However, the US Department of Homeland Security and the State Department raised a warning for Nevada hospitals to not use the Chinese-made testing kits, as there were concerns around the involvement of the Chinese government, test accuracy and privacy of the patients. Testing statistics by country\n\nTesting strategies vary by country and over time, with some countries testing very widely, while others have at times focused narrowly on only testing the seriously ill. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for \"Confirmed / tested\" than the country that also tests others. If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher \"Confirmed / population\". Studies have also found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have lower estimated case fatality rates and younger age distributions of cases.

The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France. The government has laid down draft legislation which will change the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 to allow mitochondrial DNA transfer. The procedure, which was developed British scientists, is currently banned, but ministers want to change the law to prevent children suffering debilitating conditions like muscular dystrophy. Under the new rules, IVF (In-Vitro Fertilisation) clinics will be able to replace an egg's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor's egg. It is controversial because it would result in babies having DNA from three people – and effectively, two mothers. \"The Government has run a comprehensive and transparent process over the lifetime of this Parliament to review the public acceptability of mitochondrial donation and the ongoing evidence of safety and efficacy of the new techniques involved,” said public health minister Jane Ellison in a written statement. Although rare, the disorders can be passed to future generations through the maternal line. While many doctors and scientists applaud the move, pointing out that it could eliminate terrible diseases, critics argue \"mitochondrial transfer\" could lead to designer babies. Human trials can then begin immediately. The move was welcomed by scientists and charities. Scientists at Newcastle University, who developed one of the techniques already have a waiting list of women eager to take part in the first trials. Prof Mary Herbert, Professor of Reproductive Biology, Newcastle University said: “We are delighted that the government is taking this forward. “We believe that this technique could open up the possibility of motherhood untainted by the fear of passing on a painful, debilitating condition to their future children. They may also be created by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into an egg cell of another species, creating a cloned embryo that transferred into the uterus of yet another species. Fishel introduced embryo vitrification to the UK in 1991, with the first baby to be born in the country from this technique being delivered in October 1992. Fishel has published more than 200 papers, as well as a number of books, including the 1986 bestseller In Vitro Fertilisation: Past Present\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. M. tuberculosis, then known as the \"tubercle bacillus\", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as \"Koch's bacillus\". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. The hospital determined that he had \n\n  The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is generally spread when an infected person coughs and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the lungs, but can spread to any part of the body. Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria. Humans are the only known reservoirs of M. tuberculosis. When in the lungs, M. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, but they are unable to kill and digest the bacterium.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Smoking restrictions may make it easier for smokers to quit. A study of Massachusetts youths, found that those in towns with smoking bans were 35 percent less likely to be habitual smokers. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the \n\n  Smoking bans, or smoke-free laws, are public policies, including criminal laws and occupational safety and health regulations, that prohibit tobacco smoking in certain spaces. The spaces most commonly affected by smoking bans are indoor workplaces and buildings open to the public such as restaurants, bars, office buildings, schools, retail stores, hospitals, libraries, transport facilities, and government buildings, in addition to public transport vehicles such as aircraft, buses, watercraft, and trains. However, laws may also prohibit smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, pedestrian plazas, college and hospital campuses, and within a certain distance from the entrance to a building. The most common rationale cited for restrictions on smoking is the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoke (SHS), or the inhalation of tobacco smoke by persons who are not smoking. The ban did not include workplaces, but covered all other indoor public spaces and its enforcement was somewhat limited. In the United States, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 3 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have spread to Argentina. As of , a total of  people were confirmed to have been infected, and  people were known to have died because of the virus. On 7 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first documented death, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris, France, who also had other health conditions; the case was only confirmed as positive after the patient's demise. Responses to the outbreak have included restrictions on commerce and movement, closure of borders, and the closure of schools and educational institutions. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in nursing homes, prisons and other detention centers, and urban areas. The number of tests increased over time, although there were some concerns as there was less testing than in other countries of the region such as Chile and Peru. Even so, the government's responses to the pandemic were among the best received by the population in the region during the early stages of the pandemic. Background \nOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality rate for COVID-19 has been much lower than the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, but transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Argentina indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R exceeded 1.0 from April to July 2020, after which it diminished to below 1.0 in October and November 2020. Timeline\n\nFebruary 2020 \nAfter the cruise ship Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Port of Yokohama in Japan after 10 passengers were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, among the passengers diagnosed positive was the first Argentine infected, a 61-year-old man travelling with his wife, who had no symptoms. The patient was later transferred to a hospital in Japan. The other seven Argentines on board, including his wife, remained on the ship in quarantine until 21 February. March 2020 \nA first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Buenos Aires on 3 March, in a 43-year-old man who had arrived two days earlier from Milan, Italy. Two days later, the second case was confirmed in a 23-year-old man living in Buenos Aires, who had recently returned from Northern Italy. Rapidly, on the next day the total cases increased to eight. The Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first death from coronavirus in the country on 7 March, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris who also had other health conditions. On 11 March, the government also announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries including China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. The first cases from local transmission were confirmed on the next day in Buenos Aires and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Chaco, and Córdoba. In Chaco, the first native transmission was also confirmed. The first patient with the virus in the country was discharged and left hospital in Buenos Aires the next day. Tierra del Fuego was put on lockdown on 16 March, becoming the first province to do so. On 23 March, Ministry of Health officials reported the virus was spreading via \"community transmission\" in the City of Buenos Aires, its surroundings and some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and Córdoba provinces. March concluded with 1,054 confirmed cases and 27 fatal victims. After appearance of three asymptomatic cases, Buenos Aires authorities introduced compulsory masking starting on 14 April. April finally concluded with 4,415 confirmed cases, 218 deaths and 1,245 recoveries. May ended with 16,838 confirmed cases, 539 deaths and 5,323 recoveries. On 9 June, the government of the Formosa Province reported the first case of COVID-19 in its province, leaving the Catamarca Province as the only province that did not report any cases at the time. Martín Insaurralde, the Mayor of Lomas de Zamora was diagnosed with COVID-19 and isolated on 12 June. This led to the suspension of the previously planned president's visit to Catamarca, the only province that has not reported any cases to this date. A few days later, it was informed that June concluded with 64,517 confirmed cases, 1,307 deaths and 22,015 recoveries from the virus. On 3 July, The Governor of the Catamarca Province confirmed its first case within the province. Catamarca was the last province to report its first case since the virus reached the country on 3 March. Two weeks later, on 31 July, in another press conference, Fernández announced that the lockdown restrictions at that moment would continue until 16 August as there were a record of cases and deaths in the past days due to the virus. July concluded with 191,289 confirmed cases, 3,543 deaths and 83,767 recoveries. August–September 2020 \nOn 9 August, the Ministry of Health confirmed a total of 61,867 new recoveries on that day. This led to a recovery rate of 70% of confirmed COVID-19 cases through the date. August finally concluded with 417,722 confirmed cases, 8,660 deaths and 301,182 recoveries. Over 10,000 students in San Juan became the first to return to face-to-face classes through social distancing on 10 August. They both described that were \"asymptomatic\" and also \"complying with isolation and all medical recommendations\". The contagion rate on the Greater Buenos Aires area dropped from 93 to 50.8 per cent from May though September, indicating that the virus increased its spreading through all the country. In the first 15 days of September, the provinces of Córdoba, Jujuy, La Rioja, Mendoza, Neuquén, Río Negro, Salta, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Tierra del Fuego and Tucumán registered exponential increases in their number of cases, with most of them showing high strain on their healthcare systems. On 25 September, the Health Access Secretary informed that during the previous week there was a \"stabilization trend\" in the Greater Buenos Aires area with a \"high peak of positive cases\". On the same day, it was confirmed that the Minister of Social Development, Daniel Arroyo, tested positive, while the Minister of Health of Santa Fe was hospitalised in a hospital in Rosario due to a worsening of her symptoms after testing positive for COVID-19. September concluded with 750,988 cumulative confirmed cases, 16,937 cumulative deaths and 594,632 recoveries. October–December 2020 \nOn 2 October, the governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, isolated with his family after having contact with a government worker that tested positive for COVID-19. One week later, Fernández announced that due to the epidemiological situation in the previous weeks, the lockdown would continue for another two weeks until 25 October. Contagion rate from Greater Buenos Aires diminished versus the rest of the country. As of this date, 65 per cent of the total daily confirmed cases come from all the country except the Greater Buenos Aires area, which was the main contagion focus in the past months. The provinces of Río Negro, Mendoza, Tucumán, Santa Fe, Salta, Santiago del Estero, Neuquén and Córdoba saw an increase in the number of occupied ICU beds, with Río Negro reaching to an 88 per cent of occupation. On 20 October, Argentina confirmed over 1,000,000 positive cases, becoming the fifth country to do so and the second country in South America to pass the landmark. Three days later, it was announced that the lockdown would continue for another two weeks in provinces with a high number of daily new confirmed cases. October finally ended with a total of 1,166,911 cases, 31,002 deaths and 973,926 recoveries from the virus. During the first days of November, the government announced that will acquire during December 2020 and January 2021, 25 million of doses from the Russian vaccine Sputnik V after it would enter phase III. The president also said on 3 November, that \"the horizon was starting to come into sight\", after the 7-day average of new cases dipped significantly after hitting a high on 21 October. November concluded with 1,424,518 confirmed cases, 38,730 deaths and 1,257,214 recoveries. On 22 December the flight that would bring the first doses of the Sputnik V vaccine to the country left for Moscow, after negotiations began in early December. 300,000 doses arrived on 24 December, with the vaccination campaign beginning on 29 December. The governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, was among the first to receive the vaccine. The last report of December informed that there were 1,613,911 confirmed cases, 43,163 deaths and 1,426,659 recoveries from the virus at the end of 2020. January–March 2021 \nTowards the end of the Christmas and holiday season, there was a rise on the number of daily confirmed cases. On 6 January, the Chief of Government of the City of Buenos Aires, Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, tested positive for COVID-19. The first case from the lineage B.1.1.7 of the virus was confirmed on 16 January, one month after being reported in the United Kingdom in mid-December. This variant is known for showing evidence of increased transmissibility. On 21 January, President Fernández became the first Latin American leader to be inoculated against the disease via the recently approved Sputnik V. He was later followed by Vice-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who received the vaccine on 24 January. On 19 February, the president asked the Minister of Health Ginés González García to resign, after media reported that people were able to use connections to get access to the COVID-19 vaccines. On 29 March, the government confirmed community contact cases from various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cases from the lineage B.1.1.7 (from the United Kingdom) showed an increase in the frequency of detection of the variant in Greater Buenos Aires during the previous epidemiological weeks. Other cases from the P.1 (from Brazil/Japan), P.2 (Brazil) and CAL.20C variants (United States), and L452R mutations were also found among the population. April–August 2021 \nPresident Fernández tested positive for COVID-19 on 3 April, showing mild symptoms. Fernández had been previously received the full vaccination against the virus earlier on the same year. During the first week of April, there was also an increase in the number of daily confirmed cases, leading to the begin of the second wave of the pandemic in the country. After a delay in the delivery of second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, the government announced on 5 August that they would begin applying Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines as replacements of the second doses of the Russian vaccine. Later, it was reported that Argentina's Richmond laboratories delivered nearly a million doses of the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine produced in the country to the Ministry of Health. During August, Buenos Aires City's Health Minister Fernán Quirós announced that the COVID-19 Delta variant was very close to enter into community transmission. It was later confirmed on 24 August that the first case of contagion via community circulation of the Delta variant was found in Lanús, in Buenos Aires Province. September 2021–January 2022 \nOn 6 December, the health ministry announced the detection of the first positive case of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in a fully vaccinated Argentine traveler, who entered country by airplane on 30 November from South Africa via the United States. On 7 January, Argentina surpassed over 110,000 positive tests in a single day, marking a record number of cases for a fourth consecutive day due to the surge of Omicron cases. Around 4,000 people joined a call from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) to summon volunteers to help on the influenza vaccination campaign, advanced medical students to be in triage in tents near hospitals where the patients will be first checked, volunteers to do a follow-up of isolated patients at home with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, and volunteers to work on logistics. Testing\nThe ANLIS-Malbrán (National Administration of Laboratories and Health Institutes \"Dr. Carlos G. Malbrán\") began carrying out 300 daily COVID-19 tests. Later, after 820 confirmed cases were reached, the Ministry of Health started the delivery of 35,000 reactives to expand the number of laboratories for diagnosis to all 24 jurisdictions to decentralise the testings, making the number of testings increase over time. Contact tracing\nAs an effort to fight and contain the virus, the Ministry of Health implemented a plan of contact tracing in defined areas where an increase in the number of cases is detected or estimated. The program, called Detectar (Detect in English; Strategic Testing Device for Coronavirus in Argentina Terrain), launched on May after a big jump in the number of cases in low socioeconomic class and densely populated neighbourhoods in Greater Buenos Aires, known as villas. It began on hospitals and hemotherapy centers in Greater Buenos Aires and was later extended to the rest of the country. Argentine scientists developed a quick diagnosis test to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), approved by the National Administration of Medicines, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT in Spanish). On 13 June 2020, a new announcement of another quick diagnosis test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 was made. Called ELA-chemstrip, it was developed by Argentine scientists from the National University of Quilmes and the National University of General San Martín. Another SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kit with RT-qPCR technology was approved in September 2020 by ANMAT, while a new kit under development (as of that date), would allow the joint detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses that cause influenza. On 31 May 2020, it was announced that Argentine scientists were also working to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, a project subsidised by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation. On 10 July 2020, pharmaceutical corporations Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the clinical trial for the COVID-19 vaccine BNT162 that was on phase I–II as of the day of the announcement, would begin on early-August in Argentina, soon after the trial began on Germany and the United States. One month later, Fernández announced that the vaccine produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (AZD1222) would begin production alongside Mexico after an agreement with the British pharmaceutical company and the biotechnology company mAbxience. Initially 150 million doses of the vaccine would be produced to supply all of Latin America (with the exception of Brazil). As of the day of the announcement, the vaccine, consisting of modified chimp adenovirus vector, was entering phase III. The antibodies were obtained by injecting a recombinant protein of SARS-CoV-2 in these animals, with in vitro testings demonstrating the ability to neutralise the virus. On 3 November 2020, President Fernández announced in an interview with Russian news agency that government would receive an initial of more than 10 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine by as early as December 2020, after it would enter phase III. Government officials also said that the deployment of any coronavirus vaccine in Argentina would not be mandatory. 300,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine arrived at the country in late December 2020. The Sputnik V and the BNT162b2 vaccines were the first to receive emergency approvals from ANMAT, On 30 December 2020, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca's vaccine AZD1222 was also approved for use by ANMAT. On 2 February 2021, it was announced that 1 million doses of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine would arrive during February in Argentina. Vaccination campaign \n\nVaccination against COVID-19 began in Argentina on 29 December 2020 aiming at health professionals. On 18 February 2021, vaccination on citizens aged over 70 began in the Province of Buenos Aires. Schools, among other sites, were used as temporary vaccination centres. On 18 November 2021, health minister Vizzotti said that there was \"sufficient stock\" to vaccinate all the population with a booster dose. Public response \nDuring the first weeks of the pandemic, people across the country used to applaud from balconies, terraces and windows of their houses and buildings at 9 pm, in order recognise the effort and work of health professionals, a demonstration similar to the ones that occurred during the pandemic in Spain and Italy. Other protests were realised against the government policies to combat the pandemic, corruption and insecurity, and against the bill to reform some elements of the judiciary, but the conspiracy theories about the virus were still present in the protests. Government responses \n\nThe government's responses to the pandemic was very well seen, including the mandatory lockdown and strict social distancing measures, resulting in a general better look in the number of cases and deaths than other countries in the region. Even so, the way that president Fernández and its government handled the country's response to the spread of COVID-19 resulted in the best numbers of public approval since the president's assumption in December 2019. Argentina was among the Latin American countries that earned the best grades for their response to the pandemic, according to a poll conducted in the region, only behind Uruguay and Paraguay. First measures \nOn 11 March 2020, the government announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. On 15 March 2020, it was announced that the government would close its borders for a total of 15 days to non-residents and national parks, and the suspension of public and private school classes in all levels and flights from highly affected countries for 30 days. On 16 March 2020, the province of Tierra del Fuego was put on lockdown, becoming the first province to do so. Nationwide measures\n\nMandatory lockdown \nOn 19 March 2020, President Alberto Fernández announced a mandatory lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Cities with population over 500,000 inhabitants are still under mandatory lockdown due to the communitary transmission of the virus. A survey realised during the first days of May 2020, expresses that the main concern of the surveyed people was the fear of virus contagion (50.9%) instead of the worries of a worsening in the economic situation (49.1%). Also, another survey expressed that 3 out of 10 Argentines believe the World Health Organization reports about the COVID-19 origins. According to Fernández, this urban area saw an increase of 147% of COVID-19 cases, and an increase of 95% on deaths due to the disease during the previous 20 days of the announcement. Fernández also confirmed that 97% of detected cases across the country occur in the Greater Buenos Aires. As the lockdown was due to expire on 2 August 2020, Fernández announced in a press conference on 31 July that the restrictions would continue until 16 August at least, after the country recorded a record daily tally of new cases and deaths on the previous day of the announcement. Several cities that experienced a big growth in the number of confirmed cases in the previous weeks were put back into a tighter lockdown. After three weeks, Fernández announced that due to the epidemiological situation in the weeks prior to 9 October 2020, the lockdown would continue until 25 October with new measures to decrease circulation in 18 provinces. As the country surpassed the million cases on 19 October 2020, President Fernández announced four days later that the lockdown would be extended again for two weeks in the provinces of Chubut, Córdoba, Mendoza, Neuquén, Río Negro, San Luis, Santa Fe and Tucumán, and in Greater Buenos Aires, as these provinces have been accounting for 55 per cent of the country's total cases in the previous weeks. A restriction to nighttime activities was applied on 11 January 2021 after a rise of the number of COVID-19 cases in the previous weeks. Second wave restrictions \nThe government announced on 14 April 2021 that from the following day new restrictions would apply to Greater Buenos Aires for two weeks after a rise in the number of daily cases and ICU bed occupation. Second loosening of restrictions \nIn October 2021, after the number of infections considerably decreased and having reached the mark of more than 70% of the population vaccinated, some regions, especially Buenos Aires lifted the face mask mandate when outdoors. Impact\n\nHealthcare \n\nOn 23 March 2020, Argentina's President Fernández asked the president of China, Xi Jinping, for 1,500 ventilators as Argentina had only 8,890 available. During the pandemic, more than 400 health professionals were infected, making the 15 per cent of the total confirmed cases as of 19 April 2020. The province of Chaco had the worst rate of health professionals infected, with the 52 per cent of the total cases of that jurisdiction in April 2020. Argentina's health system was also dealing with a Dengue fever outbreak, with more than 14,000 cases since 29 July 2019, and the worse measles outbreak since the end of its endemic circulation, after 174 cases and a death were confirmed since 2019. Until 18 July 2020, there were 181,043 confirmed cases of influenza (down 64.4% versus the same period in 2019), 26,323 cases of pneumonia, 24,643 cases of bronchiolitis in children under 2 years (down 84% versus the same period in 2019), and 9,495 cases of severe acute respiratory infections. Regarding the circulation of respiratory viruses, adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza B and influenza A predominated as of that date. Also, eight deaths from influenza were registered through that date, from which three of them also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was better than the forecast announced by analysts and a smaller drop than in the previous months since the beginning of the pandemic. Travel \nAfter announced a mandatory quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries, the government closed its borders, ports, and suspended flights. Some provinces also required COVID-19 tests with negative result before boarding aircraft or arriving. On 26 December 2020, the country limited the entry to the country again due to the new COVID-19 strains across the globe, and the rising of infections. One week later, the first case of a COVID-19 positive school worker was confirmed in a school in Barracas, Buenos Aires, where the school had to close due to the protocols. Criminality \nDuring the pandemic, robberies and homicide went down during the lockdown in most of the country, and increased again as time passed and some restrictions were lifted. Slums \n\nArgentina has a long-standing housing access and slums problem, which was only worsened by the pandemic. Special testing and containment efforts had to be put in place in lower-income neighbourhoods, mostly after outbreaks in Buenos Aires (Villa 31 and Barrio Mujica) and Quilmes (Villa Azul and Villa Itatí) shantytowns. These areas, with scarce access to water and ventilation, as well as overcrowding, make complying to the mandatory lockdown difficult and facilitate the COVID-19 rapid spread. The DetectAr testing campaign in Buenos Aires' slums included research of housing conditions and the taking of samples in common areas (such as meal centers) for RT-qPCR tests, which showed high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. In the Patagonia region, occupations by people referencing themselves as Mapuches also surged amid the pandemic. 36 workers tested positive for the virus and 130 people had to be isolated. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the line accumulated 56 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to that date. This led to cases of citizens not being able to greet a family member on their deathbed despite having the required permits, and patients dying due to ambulances not being allowed to enter another province. It was estimated that around 8,000 people were stranded trying to access the Formosa Province, which led to a ruling of the Supreme Court of Argentina stating they should be granted access. The first cases of COVID-19 reached Argentine television in June 2020. The first confirmed case was from El Nueve's sports journalist Guillermo Ferro. On 27 June 2020, news channel C5N implemented a protocol to prevent new infections after one of their journalists, Fernanda Arena, tested positive for COVID-19. Through the beginning of September, several journalists, hosts, crew and famous personalities from television and radio tested positive for the virus. Santiago del Moro, Catherine Fulop, Guido Kaczka, Andy Kusnetzoff, Alejandro Fantino, Baby Etchecopar, Eduardo Feinmann, Nicole Neumann and Maju Lozano were among the people from the Argentine media that have been tested positive.

Argentina\nArgentina\nDisease outbreaks in Argentina\n2020 in Argentina\n2021 in Argentina\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). On 3 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have spread to Argentina. As of , a total of  people were confirmed to have been infected, and  people were known to have died because of the virus. On 7 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first documented death, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris, France, who also had other health conditions; the case was only confirmed as positive after the patient's demise. Responses to the outbreak have included restrictions on commerce and movement, closure of borders, and the closure of schools and educational institutions. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in nursing homes, prisons and other detention centers, and urban areas. The number of tests increased over time, although there were some concerns as there was less testing than in other countries of the region such as Chile and Peru. Even so, the government's responses to the pandemic were among the best received by the population in the region during the early stages of the pandemic.

January–March 2021 \nTowards the end of the Christmas and holiday season, there was a rise on the number of daily confirmed cases. On 6 January, the Chief of Government of the City of Buenos Aires, Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, tested positive for COVID-19. The first case from the lineage B.1.1.7 of the virus was confirmed on 16 January, one month after being reported in the United Kingdom in mid-December. This variant is known for showing evidence of increased transmissibility. On 21 January, President Fernández became the first Latin American leader to be inoculated against the disease via the recently approved Sputnik V. He was later followed by Vice-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who received the vaccine on 24 January. On 19 February, the president asked the Minister of Health Ginés González García to resign, after media reported that people were able to use connections to get access to the COVID-19 vaccines. On 29 March, the government confirmed community contact cases from various SARS-CoV-2 variants. Cases from the lineage B.1.1.7 (from the United Kingdom) showed an increase in the frequency of detection of the variant in Greater Buenos Aires during the previous epidemiological weeks. Other cases from the P.1 (from Brazil/Japan), P.2 (Brazil) and CAL.20C variants (United States), and L452R mutations were also found among the population. April–August 2021 \nPresident Fernández tested positive for COVID-19 on 3 April, showing mild symptoms. Fernández had been previously received the full vaccination against the virus earlier on the same year. During the first week of April, there was also an increase in the number of daily confirmed cases, leading to the begin of the second wave of the pandemic in the country. After a delay in the delivery of second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, the government announced on 5 August that they would begin applying Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines as replacements of the second doses of the Russian vaccine. Later, it was reported that Argentina's Richmond laboratories delivered nearly a million doses of the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine produced in the country to the Ministry of Health. During August, Buenos Aires City's Health Minister Fernán Quirós announced that the COVID-19 Delta variant was very close to enter into community transmission. It was later confirmed on 24 August that the first case of contagion via community circulation of the Delta variant was found in Lanús, in Buenos Aires Province. September 2021–January 2022 \nOn 6 December, the health ministry announced the detection of the first positive case of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in a fully vaccinated Argentine traveler, who entered country by airplane on 30 November from South Africa via the United States. On 7 January, Argentina surpassed over 110,000 positive tests in a single day, marking a record number of cases for a fourth consecutive day due to the surge of Omicron cases. Around 4,000 people joined a call from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) to summon volunteers to help on the influenza vaccination campaign, advanced medical students to be in triage in tents near hospitals where the patients will be first checked, volunteers to do a follow-up of isolated patients at home with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, and volunteers to work on logistics. Testing\nThe ANLIS-Malbrán (National Administration of Laboratories and Health Institutes \"Dr. Carlos G. Malbrán\") began carrying out 300 daily COVID-19 tests. Later, after 820 confirmed cases were reached, the Ministry of Health started the delivery of 35,000 reactives to expand the number of laboratories for diagnosis to all 24 jurisdictions to decentralise the testings, making the number of testings increase over time. Contact tracing\nAs an effort to fight and contain the virus, the Ministry of Health implemented a plan of contact tracing in defined areas where an increase in the number of cases is detected or estimated. The program, called Detectar (Detect in English; Strategic Testing Device for Coronavirus in Argentina Terrain), launched on May after a big jump in the number of cases in low socioeconomic class and densely populated neighbourhoods in Greater Buenos Aires, known as villas. It began on hospitals and hemotherapy centers in Greater Buenos Aires and was later extended to the rest of the country. Argentine scientists developed a quick diagnosis test to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), approved by the National Administration of Medicines, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT in Spanish). On 13 June 2020, a new announcement of another quick diagnosis test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 was made. Called ELA-chemstrip, it was developed by Argentine scientists from the National University of Quilmes and the National University of General San Martín. Another SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kit with RT-qPCR technology was approved in September 2020 by ANMAT, while a new kit under development (as of that date), would allow the joint detection of SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses that cause influenza. On 31 May 2020, it was announced that Argentine scientists were also working to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, a project subsidised by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation. On 10 July 2020, pharmaceutical corporations Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the clinical trial for the COVID-19 vaccine BNT162 that was on phase I–II as of the day of the announcement, would begin on early-August in Argentina, soon after the trial began on Germany and the United States. One month later, Fernández announced that the vaccine produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (AZD1222) would begin production alongside Mexico after an agreement with the British pharmaceutical company and the biotechnology company mAbxience. Initially 150 million doses of the vaccine would be produced to supply all of Latin America (with the exception of Brazil). As of the day of the announcement, the vaccine, consisting of modified chimp adenovirus vector, was entering phase III. The antibodies were obtained by injecting a recombinant protein of SARS-CoV-2 in these animals, with in vitro testings demonstrating the ability to neutralise the virus. On 3 November 2020, President Fernández announced in an interview with Russian news agency that government would receive an initial of more than 10 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine by as early as December 2020, after it would enter phase III. Government officials also said that the deployment of any coronavirus vaccine in Argentina would not be mandatory. 300,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine arrived at the country in late December 2020. The Sputnik V and the BNT162b2 vaccines were the first to receive emergency approvals from ANMAT, On 30 December 2020, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca's vaccine AZD1222 was also approved for use by ANMAT. On 2 February 2021, it was announced that 1 million doses of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine would arrive during February in Argentina. Vaccination campaign \n\nVaccination against COVID-19 began in Argentina on 29 December 2020 aiming at health professionals. On 18 February 2021, vaccination on citizens aged over 70 began in the Province of Buenos Aires. Schools, among other sites, were used as temporary vaccination centres. On 18 November 2021, health minister Vizzotti said that there was \"sufficient stock\" to vaccinate all the population with a booster dose. Public response \nDuring the first weeks of the pandemic, people across the country used to applaud from balconies, terraces and windows of their houses and buildings at 9 pm, in order recognise the effort and work of health professionals, a demonstration similar to the ones that occurred during the pandemic in Spain and Italy. Other protests were realised against the government policies to combat the pandemic, corruption and insecurity, and against the bill to reform some elements of the judiciary, but the conspiracy theories about the virus were still present in the protests. Government responses \n\nThe government's responses to the pandemic was very well seen, including the mandatory lockdown and strict social distancing measures, resulting in a general better look in the number of cases and deaths than other countries in the region. Even so, the way that president Fernández and its government handled the country's response to the spread of COVID-19 resulted in the best numbers of public approval since the president's assumption in December 2019. Argentina was among the Latin American countries that earned the best grades for their response to the pandemic, according to a poll conducted in the region, only behind Uruguay and Paraguay. First measures \nOn 11 March 2020, the government announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. On 15 March 2020, it was announced that the government would close its borders for a total of 15 days to non-residents and national parks, and the suspension of public and private school classes in all levels and flights from highly affected countries for 30 days. On 16 March 2020, the province of Tierra del Fuego was put on lockdown, becoming the first province to do so. Nationwide measures\n\nMandatory lockdown \nOn 19 March 2020, President Alberto Fernández announced a mandatory lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Geographical segmentation \nThe third phase of the lockdown was announced on 25 April 2020 by president Fernández. Cities with population over 500,000 inhabitants are still under mandatory lockdown due to the communitary transmission of the virus. A survey realised during the first days of May 2020, expresses that the main concern of the surveyed people was the fear of virus contagion (50.9%) instead of the worries of a worsening in the economic situation (49.1%). Also, another survey expressed that 3 out of 10 Argentines believe the World Health Organization reports about the COVID-19 origins. According to Fernández, this urban area saw an increase of 147% of COVID-19 cases, and an increase of 95% on deaths due to the disease during the previous 20 days of the announcement. Fernández also confirmed that 97% of detected cases across the country occur in the Greater Buenos Aires. As the lockdown was due to expire on 2 August 2020, Fernández announced in a press conference on 31 July that the restrictions would continue until 16 August at least, after the country recorded a record daily tally of new cases and deaths on the previous day of the announcement. Several cities that experienced a big growth in the number of confirmed cases in the previous weeks were put back into a tighter lockdown. After three weeks, Fernández announced that due to the epidemiological situation in the weeks prior to 9 October 2020, the lockdown would continue until 25 October with new measures to decrease circulation in 18 provinces. As the country surpassed the million cases on 19 October 2020, President Fernández announced four days later that the lockdown would be extended again for two weeks in the provinces of Chubut, Córdoba, Mendoza, Neuquén, Río Negro, San Luis, Santa Fe and Tucumán, and in Greater Buenos Aires, as these provinces have been accounting for 55 per cent of the country's total cases in the previous weeks. A restriction to nighttime activities was applied on 11 January 2021 after a rise of the number of COVID-19 cases in the previous weeks. Second wave restrictions \nThe government announced on 14 April 2021 that from the following day new restrictions would apply to Greater Buenos Aires for two weeks after a rise in the number of daily cases and ICU bed occupation. Second loosening of restrictions \nIn October 2021, after the number of infections considerably decreased and having reached the mark of more than 70% of the population vaccinated, some regions, especially Buenos Aires lifted the face mask mandate when outdoors. Impact\n\nHealthcare \n\nOn 23 March 2020, Argentina's President Fernández asked the president of China, Xi Jinping, for 1,500 ventilators as Argentina had only 8,890 available. During the pandemic, more than 400 health professionals were infected, making the 15 per cent of the total confirmed cases as of 19 April 2020. The province of Chaco had the worst rate of health professionals infected, with the 52 per cent of the total cases of that jurisdiction in April 2020. Argentina's health system was also dealing with a Dengue fever outbreak, with more than 14,000 cases since 29 July 2019, and the worse measles outbreak since the end of its endemic circulation, after 174 cases and a death were confirmed since 2019. Until 18 July 2020, there were 181,043 confirmed cases of influenza (down 64.4% versus the same period in 2019), 26,323 cases of pneumonia, 24,643 cases of bronchiolitis in children under 2 years (down 84% versus the same period in 2019), and 9,495 cases of severe acute respiratory infections. Regarding the circulation of respiratory viruses, adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza B and influenza A predominated as of that date. Also, eight deaths from influenza were registered through that date, from which three of them also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was better than the forecast announced by analysts and a smaller drop than in the previous months since the beginning of the pandemic. Travel \nAfter announced a mandatory quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries, the government closed its borders, ports, and suspended flights. Some provinces also required COVID-19 tests with negative result before boarding aircraft or arriving. On 26 December 2020, the country limited the entry to the country again due to the new COVID-19 strains across the globe, and the rising of infections. One week later, the first case of a COVID-19 positive school worker was confirmed in a school in Barracas, Buenos Aires, where the school had to close due to the protocols. Criminality \nDuring the pandemic, robberies and homicide went down during the lockdown in most of the country, and increased again as time passed and some restrictions were lifted. Slums \n\nArgentina has a long-standing housing access and slums problem, which was only worsened by the pandemic. Special testing and containment efforts had to be put in place in lower-income neighbourhoods, mostly after outbreaks in Buenos Aires (Villa 31 and Barrio Mujica) and Quilmes (Villa Azul and Villa Itatí) shantytowns. These areas, with scarce access to water and ventilation, as well as overcrowding, make complying to the mandatory lockdown difficult and facilitate the COVID-19 rapid spread. The DetectAr testing campaign in Buenos Aires' slums included research of housing conditions and the taking of samples in common areas (such as meal centers) for RT-qPCR tests, which showed high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. In the Patagonia region, occupations by people referencing themselves as Mapuches also surged amid the pandemic. 36 workers tested positive for the virus and 130 people had to be isolated. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the line accumulated 56 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to that date. This led to cases of citizens not being able to greet a family member on their deathbed despite having the required permits, and patients dying due to ambulances not being allowed to enter another province. It was estimated that around 8,000 people were stranded trying to access the Formosa Province, which led to a ruling of the Supreme Court of Argentina stating they should be granted access. The first cases of COVID-19 reached Argentine television in June 2020. The first confirmed case was from El Nueve's sports journalist Guillermo Ferro. On 27 June 2020, news channel C5N implemented a protocol to prevent new infections after one of their journalists, Fernanda Arena, tested positive for COVID-19. Through the beginning of September, several journalists, hosts, crew and famous personalities from television and radio tested positive for the virus. Santiago del Moro, Catherine Fulop, Guido Kaczka, Andy Kusnetzoff, Alejandro Fantino, Baby Etchecopar, Eduardo Feinmann, Nicole Neumann and Maju Lozano were among the people from the Argentine media that have been tested positive.

The death toll remains at 28. ; Ukraine has reported 9,721 new daily cases and record high 201 new daily deaths, bringing the total numbers to 440,188 and 8,125 respectively; a total of 195,544 patients have recovered. The COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). On 3 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have spread to Argentina. As of , a total of  people were confirmed to have been infected, and  people were known to have died because of the virus. On 7 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first documented death, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris, France, who also had other health conditions; the case was only confirmed as positive after the patient's demise. Responses to the outbreak have included restrictions on commerce and movement, closure of borders, and the closure of schools and educational institutions. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in nursing homes, prisons and other detention centers, and urban areas. The number of tests increased over time, although there were some concerns as there was less testing than in other countries of the region such as Chile and Peru. Even so, the government's responses to the pandemic were among the best received by the population in the region during the early stages of the pandemic. Background \nOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality rate for COVID-19 has been much lower than the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, but transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Argentina indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R exceeded 1.0 from April to July 2020, after which it diminished to below 1.0 in October and November 2020. Timeline\n\nFebruary 2020 \nAfter the cruise ship Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Port of Yokohama in Japan after 10 passengers were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, among the passengers diagnosed positive was the first Argentine infected, a 61-year-old man travelling with his wife, who had no symptoms. The patient was later transferred to a hospital in Japan. The other seven Argentines on board, including his wife, remained on the ship in quarantine until 21 February. March 2020 \nA first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Buenos Aires on 3 March, in a 43-year-old man who had arrived two days earlier from Milan, Italy. Two days later, the second case was confirmed in a 23-year-old man living in Buenos Aires, who had recently returned from Northern Italy. Rapidly, on the next day the total cases increased to eight. The Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first death from coronavirus in the country on 7 March, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris who also had other health conditions. On 11 March, the government also announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries including China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. The first cases from local transmission were confirmed on the next day in Buenos Aires and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Chaco, and Córdoba. In Chaco, the first native transmission was also confirmed. The first patient with the virus in the country was discharged and left hospital in Buenos Aires the next day. Tierra del Fuego was put on lockdown on 16 March, becoming the first province to do so. On 23 March, Ministry of Health officials reported the virus was spreading via \"community transmission\" in the City of Buenos Aires, its surroundings and some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and Córdoba provinces. March concluded with 1,054 confirmed cases and 27 fatal victims. After appearance of three asymptomatic cases, Buenos Aires authorities introduced compulsory masking starting on 14 April. April finally concluded with 4,415 confirmed cases, 218 deaths and 1,245 recoveries. May ended with 16,838 confirmed cases, 539 deaths and 5,323 recoveries. On 9 June, the government of the Formosa Province reported the first case of COVID-19 in its province, leaving the Catamarca Province as the only province that did not report any cases at the time. Martín Insaurralde, the Mayor of Lomas de Zamora was diagnosed with COVID-19 and isolated on 12 June. This led to the suspension of the previously planned president's visit to Catamarca, the only province that has not reported any cases to this date. A few days later, it was informed that June concluded with 64,517 confirmed cases, 1,307 deaths and 22,015 recoveries from the virus. On 3 July, The Governor of the Catamarca Province confirmed its first case within the province. Catamarca was the last province to report its first case since the virus reached the country on 3 March. Two weeks later, on 31 July, in another press conference, Fernández announced that the lockdown restrictions at that moment would continue until 16 August as there were a record of cases and deaths in the past days due to the virus. July concluded with 191,289 confirmed cases, 3,543 deaths and 83,767 recoveries. August–September 2020 \nOn 9 August, the Ministry of Health confirmed a total of 61,867 new recoveries on that day. This led to a recovery rate of 70% of confirmed COVID-19 cases through the date. August finally concluded with 417,722 confirmed cases, 8,660 deaths and 301,182 recoveries. Over 10,000 students in San Juan became the first to return to face-to-face classes through social distancing on 10 August. They both described that were \"asymptomatic\" and also \"complying with isolation and all medical recommendations\". The contagion rate on the Greater Buenos Aires area dropped from 93 to 50.8 per cent from May though September, indicating that the virus increased its spreading through all the country. In the first 15 days of September, the provinces of Córdoba, Jujuy, La Rioja, Mendoza, Neuquén, Río Negro, Salta, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Tierra del Fuego and Tucumán registered exponential increases in their number of cases, with most of them showing high strain on their healthcare systems. On 25 September, the Health Access Secretary informed that during the previous week there was a \"stabilization trend\" in the Greater Buenos Aires area with a \"high peak of positive cases\". On the same day, it was confirmed that the Minister of Social Development, Daniel Arroyo, tested positive, while the Minister of Health of Santa Fe was hospitalised in a hospital in Rosario due to a worsening of her symptoms after testing positive for COVID-19. September concluded with 750,988 cumulative confirmed cases, 16,937 cumulative deaths and 594,632 recoveries. October–December 2020 \nOn 2 October, the governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, isolated with his family after having contact with a government worker that tested positive for COVID-19. One week later, Fernández announced that due to the epidemiological situation in the previous weeks, the lockdown would continue for another two weeks until 25 October. Contagion rate from Greater Buenos Aires diminished versus the rest of the country. As of this date, 65 per cent of the total daily confirmed cases come from all the country except the Greater Buenos Aires area, which was the main contagion focus in the past months. The provinces of Río Negro, Mendoza, Tucumán, Santa Fe, Salta, Santiago del Estero, Neuquén and Córdoba saw an increase in the number of occupied ICU beds, with Río Negro reaching to an 88 per cent of occupation. On 20 October, Argentina confirmed over 1,000,000 positive cases, becoming the fifth country to do so and the second country in South America to pass the landmark. Three days later, it was announced that the lockdown would continue for another two weeks in provinces with a high number of daily new confirmed cases. October finally ended with a total of 1,166,911 cases, 31,002 deaths and 973,926 recoveries from the virus. During the first days of November, the government announced that will acquire during December 2020 and January 2021, 25 million of doses from the Russian vaccine Sputnik V after it would enter phase III. The president also said on 3 November, that \"the horizon was starting to come into sight\", after the 7-day average of new cases dipped significantly after hitting a high on 21 October. November concluded with 1,424,518 confirmed cases, 38,730 deaths and 1,257,214 recoveries. On 22 December the flight that would bring the first doses of the Sputnik V vaccine to the country left for Moscow, after negotiations began in early December. 300,000 doses arrived on 24 December, with the vaccination campaign beginning on 29 December. The governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, was among the first to receive the vaccine. The last report of December informed that there were 1,613,911 confirmed cases, 43,163 deaths and 1,426,659 recoveries from the virus at the end of 2020. January–March 2021 \nTowards the end of the Christmas and holiday season, there was a rise on the number of daily confirmed cases.

On 18 February 2021, vaccination on citizens aged over 70 began in the Province of Buenos Aires. Schools, among other sites, were used as temporary vaccination centres. On 18 November 2021, health minister Vizzotti said that there was \"sufficient stock\" to vaccinate all the population with a booster dose. Public response \nDuring the first weeks of the pandemic, people across the country used to applaud from balconies, terraces and windows of their houses and buildings at 9 pm, in order recognise the effort and work of health professionals, a demonstration similar to the ones that occurred during the pandemic in Spain and Italy. Other protests were realised against the government policies to combat the pandemic, corruption and insecurity, and against the bill to reform some elements of the judiciary, but the conspiracy theories about the virus were still present in the protests. Government responses \n\nThe government's responses to the pandemic was very well seen, including the mandatory lockdown and strict social distancing measures, resulting in a general better look in the number of cases and deaths than other countries in the region. Even so, the way that president Fernández and its government handled the country's response to the spread of COVID-19 resulted in the best numbers of public approval since the president's assumption in December 2019. Argentina was among the Latin American countries that earned the best grades for their response to the pandemic, according to a poll conducted in the region, only behind Uruguay and Paraguay. First measures \nOn 11 March 2020, the government announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. On 15 March 2020, it was announced that the government would close its borders for a total of 15 days to non-residents and national parks, and the suspension of public and private school classes in all levels and flights from highly affected countries for 30 days. On 16 March 2020, the province of Tierra del Fuego was put on lockdown, becoming the first province to do so. Nationwide measures\n\nMandatory lockdown \nOn 19 March 2020, President Alberto Fernández announced a mandatory lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. Geographical segmentation \nThe third phase of the lockdown was announced on 25 April 2020 by president Fernández. Cities with population over 500,000 inhabitants are still under mandatory lockdown due to the communitary transmission of the virus. A survey realised during the first days of May 2020, expresses that the main concern of the surveyed people was the fear of virus contagion (50.9%) instead of the worries of a worsening in the economic situation (49.1%). Also, another survey expressed that 3 out of 10 Argentines believe the World Health Organization reports about the COVID-19 origins. According to Fernández, this urban area saw an increase of 147% of COVID-19 cases, and an increase of 95% on deaths due to the disease during the previous 20 days of the announcement. Fernández also confirmed that 97% of detected cases across the country occur in the Greater Buenos Aires. As the lockdown was due to expire on 2 August 2020, Fernández announced in a press conference on 31 July that the restrictions would continue until 16 August at least, after the country recorded a record daily tally of new cases and deaths on the previous day of the announcement. Several cities that experienced a big growth in the number of confirmed cases in the previous weeks were put back into a tighter lockdown. After three weeks, Fernández announced that due to the epidemiological situation in the weeks prior to 9 October 2020, the lockdown would continue until 25 October with new measures to decrease circulation in 18 provinces. As the country surpassed the million cases on 19 October 2020, President Fernández announced four days later that the lockdown would be extended again for two weeks in the provinces of Chubut, Córdoba, Mendoza, Neuquén, Río Negro, San Luis, Santa Fe and Tucumán, and in Greater Buenos Aires, as these provinces have been accounting for 55 per cent of the country's total cases in the previous weeks. A restriction to nighttime activities was applied on 11 January 2021 after a rise of the number of COVID-19 cases in the previous weeks. Second wave restrictions \nThe government announced on 14 April 2021 that from the following day new restrictions would apply to Greater Buenos Aires for two weeks after a rise in the number of daily cases and ICU bed occupation. Second loosening of restrictions \nIn October 2021, after the number of infections considerably decreased and having reached the mark of more than 70% of the population vaccinated, some regions, especially Buenos Aires lifted the face mask mandate when outdoors. Impact\n\nHealthcare \n\nOn 23 March 2020, Argentina's President Fernández asked the president of China, Xi Jinping, for 1,500 ventilators as Argentina had only 8,890 available. During the pandemic, more than 400 health professionals were infected, making the 15 per cent of the total confirmed cases as of 19 April 2020. The province of Chaco had the worst rate of health professionals infected, with the 52 per cent of the total cases of that jurisdiction in April 2020. Argentina's health system was also dealing with a Dengue fever outbreak, with more than 14,000 cases since 29 July 2019, and the worse measles outbreak since the end of its endemic circulation, after 174 cases and a death were confirmed since 2019. Until 18 July 2020, there were 181,043 confirmed cases of influenza (down 64.4% versus the same period in 2019), 26,323 cases of pneumonia, 24,643 cases of bronchiolitis in children under 2 years (down 84% versus the same period in 2019), and 9,495 cases of severe acute respiratory infections. Regarding the circulation of respiratory viruses, adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza B and influenza A predominated as of that date. Also, eight deaths from influenza were registered through that date, from which three of them also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was better than the forecast announced by analysts and a smaller drop than in the previous months since the beginning of the pandemic. Travel \nAfter announced a mandatory quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries, the government closed its borders, ports, and suspended flights. Some provinces also required COVID-19 tests with negative result before boarding aircraft or arriving. On 26 December 2020, the country limited the entry to the country again due to the new COVID-19 strains across the globe, and the rising of infections. One week later, the first case of a COVID-19 positive school worker was confirmed in a school in Barracas, Buenos Aires, where the school had to close due to the protocols. Criminality \nDuring the pandemic, robberies and homicide went down during the lockdown in most of the country, and increased again as time passed and some restrictions were lifted. Slums \n\nArgentina has a long-standing housing access and slums problem, which was only worsened by the pandemic. Special testing and containment efforts had to be put in place in lower-income neighbourhoods, mostly after outbreaks in Buenos Aires (Villa 31 and Barrio Mujica) and Quilmes (Villa Azul and Villa Itatí) shantytowns. These areas, with scarce access to water and ventilation, as well as overcrowding, make complying to the mandatory lockdown difficult and facilitate the COVID-19 rapid spread. The DetectAr testing campaign in Buenos Aires' slums included research of housing conditions and the taking of samples in common areas (such as meal centers) for RT-qPCR tests, which showed high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. In the Patagonia region, occupations by people referencing themselves as Mapuches also surged amid the pandemic. 36 workers tested positive for the virus and 130 people had to be isolated. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the line accumulated 56 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to that date. This led to cases of citizens not being able to greet a family member on their deathbed despite having the required permits, and patients dying due to ambulances not being allowed to enter another province. It was estimated that around 8,000 people were stranded trying to access the Formosa Province, which led to a ruling of the Supreme Court of Argentina stating they should be granted access. The first cases of COVID-19 reached Argentine television in June 2020. The first confirmed case was from El Nueve's sports journalist Guillermo Ferro. On 27 June 2020, news channel C5N implemented a protocol to prevent new infections after one of their journalists, Fernanda Arena, tested positive for COVID-19. Through the beginning of September, several journalists, hosts, crew and famous personalities from television and radio tested positive for the virus. Santiago del Moro, Catherine Fulop, Guido Kaczka, Andy Kusnetzoff, Alejandro Fantino, Baby Etchecopar, Eduardo Feinmann, Nicole Neumann and Maju Lozano were among the people from the Argentine media that have been tested positive.

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors\n\nVarious risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:\n Prematurity\n High exposure to oxygen\n Low birth weight\n Various types of infections\n Cardiac defects\n Anaemia \n Low vitamin E level\n\nPathophysiology\n\nDuring development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of \"plus disease\". Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. The circumferential extent of the disease is described in segments as if the top of the eye were 12 on the face of an analog clock, e.g. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.) This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina. Any premature baby with severe illness in perinatal period (Respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, blood transfusion, Intra ventricular haemorrhage, apnoeic episodes, etc.) may also be offered ROP screening. Examination of the retina of a premature infant is performed to determine how far the retinal blood vessels have grown (the zone), and whether or not the vessels are growing flat along the wall of the eye (the stage). Once the vessels have grown into zoneIII (see below) it is usually safe to discharge the child from further screening for ROP. Monitoring\n\nIn order to allow timely intervention, a system of monitoring is undertaken for infants at risk of developing ROP. In the USA the consensus statement of experts is informed by data derived by clinical trials and published in Pediatrics 2006. They included infants with birthweights under 1500 grams or under 30 weeks gestation in most cases. Furthermore, recent trials have shown that treatment at an earlier stage of the disease gives better results. Few centers in the world specialize in this surgery, because of its attendant surgical risks and generally poor outcomes. Oral propranolol is being evaluated for counteracting the progression of ROP, but safety is a concern. Furthermore, there was a 52% relative risk reduction for the need for laser treatment or intravitreal bevacizumab. In others, only children treated for ROP are followed yearly. Follow up of premature children (with or without ROP) is varying among centers and countries, mirroring the diverse states of health care system in different countries. Prognosis\n\nStages 1 and 2 do not lead to blindness. In these countries ROP is often the most common cause of blindness in children. ROP is highly likely to become an increasing problem in India, China and other countries in Asia as these countries expand the provision of services for premature infants. There is also evidence that the population of premature infants at risk of severe ROP varies depending on the level of neonatal intensive care being provided. In countries with high development indices and very low neonatal mortality rates (e.g. North America, Western Europe), severe ROP is generally limited to extremely preterm infants i.e. those weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) at birth. At the other end of the development spectrum, countries with very low development indices and very high neonatal mortality rates (e.g. Countries with moderate development indices are improving access to neonatal intensive care, and in these settings bigger, more mature babies are also at risk of severe ROP as neonatal care may be suboptimal. These findings have two main implications: firstly, much can be done in countries with moderate development indices to improve neonatal care, to reduce the risk of severe ROP in bigger babies and increase survival of extremely preterm infants, and secondly, in these settings bigger more mature babies need to be included in ROP programs and examined regularly so as to detect those babies developing ROP requiring treatment. In 2012, the World Health Organization published data on rates of preterm birth and the number of premature babies born in different regions of the world. This report contained three main findings: \n Premature birth has many different causes, and prevention is challenging,\n Prematurity is the most common cause of neonatal death in many countries, totaling as many as 1 million infants annually due to complications of preterm birth, and\n the number of preterm births is currently estimated to be 15 million, and increasing. History\n\nThis disease was first described in a premature baby in 1942. Between 1941–1953, over 12,000 babies worldwide were affected by it. Cases were then seen all over the world and the cause was, at that point, unknown. By 1951 a clear link between incidence and affluence became clear: many cases were seen in developed countries with organized and well-funded health care. Two British scientists suggested that it was oxygen toxicity that caused the disease. Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated in incubators which had artificially high levels of oxygen. Studies on rats made this cause seem more likely, but the link was eventually confirmed by a controversial study undertaken by American pediatricians. The study involved two groups of babies. The latter group was shown to have a lower incidence of the disease. As a result, oxygen levels in incubators were lowered and consequently, the epidemic was halted. Each case of ROP avoided by withholding oxygen \"may have cost some 16 deaths\". References\n\nExternal links\n\n Retinopathy of Prematurity Resource Guide from the National Eye Institute (NEI).

It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used due to the premature development of their lungs.

But they question whether robotic surgery is preferable to another minimally invasive procedure, laparoscopic surgery, for women having their uterus removed for non-cancerous conditions. \"The robotically assisted procedure was substantially more expensive,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Jason Wright, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City. Wright said more work is needed to determine which women would benefit from robotic hysterectomy. \"This data also raises a lot of questions about surgical innovations and the need to find ways to better study them before they diffuse into practice,\" he added. Robotically assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopic surgery, but the surgeon uses a robotic device instead of a laparoscope to do the procedure. Dr. Michael Zinner, chief of surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said there are advantages to robotically assisted surgery in certain situations. \"The wrist on the machine gives you [greater flexibility] unlike a straight laparoscope that's more like a chopstick. If the surgeon has any slight tremor, the machine evens it out,\" he said. \"Nobody talks about using robotic surgery for removing the gallbladder,\" noted Zinner, because it would be more expensive without providing an additional benefit. Robotically assisted hysterectomies were performed 0.5 percent of the time in 2007. At hospitals that introduced robotically assisted hysterectomy, its use quickly rose, the study found. But at hospitals without the robotic option, use of laparoscopic hysterectomy increased during the same time period. Robotically assisted hysterectomy was less likely to lead to a hospital stay of two days or more compared to laparoscopic surgery, but the two procedures were similar in all other measured complications. Where the two procedures differed most significantly was in cost, with $6,679 the median fee for a laparoscopic hysterectomy versus $8,868 for the robotically assisted procedure. \"It seems like at this point in time, insurers are paying the same whether the surgery is robotically assisted or not. If you're considering a robotically assisted procedure, Zinner and Weissman advised talking with your doctor about which procedure will deliver better results. If two procedures are similarly effective, they suggested comparing costs. In the case of hysterectomy, because robotically assisted surgery and laparoscopic surgery have similar results but significantly different costs, Zinner said he'd like to see more surgeons training in the laparoscopic procedure. ; Nguyen, Hiep T.\nPurpose of review Minimally invasive surgeries such as conventional laparoscopic surgery and robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) have significant advantages over the traditional open surgical approach including lower pain medication requirements and decreased length of hospitalization. However, open surgery has demonstrated better success rates and shorter surgery time when compared to the other modalities. Currently, it is unclear which approach has better long-term clinical outcomes, greater benefits and less cost. Recent findings There are limited studies in the literature comparing these three different surgical approaches. With experience, the outcomes of RALS are improving, justifying its usage. Principally, the minimally invasive approach allows for a significant reduction in the morbidity associated with the open surgical incision, resulting in decreased use of pain medication, quicker recovery and decreased length of hospital stay. Movement of the laparoscopic instruments and manipulation of the tissues may be challenging due to two-dimensional imaging provided by the laparoscope. Moreover, the use of rigid laparoscopic instruments results in the loss of haptic (force and touch) feedback and dexterity (40 compared to 70 of freedom with open surgery). In addition, these instruments allow for the transmission of tremors and require counterintuitive movements (due to the fulcrum effect by the trocars), which adds to the technical challenge and complexity of advanced maneuvers such as intracorporeal suturing. Together, these advantages allow the surgeon to perform laparoscopic movements more precisely and easily, compared to CLS. Despite the benefits of being minimally invasive, laparoscopy pyeloplasty failed to be adopted widely due to technical challenges, specifically with the intracorporeal suturing . Despite its popularity, there is a paucity of data (seven series) regarding its long-term, clinical outcome [4▪▪]. In addition, there are a limited number of studies that provide a direct comparison between the various surgical approaches for the treatment of UPJO, the majority being retrospective. In comparison to open dismembered pyeloplasty, RALP is typically associated with longer operative times due to the need for setting up and docking the robotic system. However, subsequent studies indicated that with the creation of a collaborative protocol between surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists, the operative times associated with RALP could be significantly reduced, nearing to that of open dismembered pyeloplasty [4▪▪,8]. Moreover, RALP is associated with higher parental satisfaction regarding overall life, impact of the surgery on patient life, burden of postoperative follow-up and size of incision scar when compared to open dismembered pyeloplasty . In comparison to laparoscopy pyeloplasty, RALP was associated with similar overall operative times with comparable results . As laparoscopy pyeloplasty is not associated with the high equipment cost as with RALP, it may be concluded that laparoscopy pyeloplasty is always preferable over RALP. However, it has been observed that the ureteropelvic anastomosis is easier to perform with RALP, closely emulating the movement and techniques used during open surgery . As additional laparoscopic skills are not needed, the learning curve for RALP may be markedly abbreviated requiring little previous robotic or laparoscopic experience [11▪]. Less invasive approaches have been developed to minimize the morbidity associated with ureteral reimplantation. This technique has failed to achieve success rates comparable to open reimplantation likely due to the difficult dissection and suturing of the bladder required . With robotic assistance, the laparoscopic approach has become more feasible resulting from the improved visualization and the increased maneuverability of the instruments [1,15]. Like OUR, robotic assisted laparoscopic ureteral reimplant (RALUR) can be performed either through an intravesical or extravesical approach. They had one complication in which urine leakage developed postoperatively from one of the trocar sites. [17▪] reported on 19 patients who underwent intravesical RALUR; they performed a case match comparison with 22 patients undergoing intravesical OUR. However, RALUR required longer operative times compared to OUR. Compared to the extravesical approach, intravesical RALUR is technically more challenging, associated with difficulties in maintaining pneumovesicum (either through leakage around the trocars or retroperitoneally following ureter dissection) and the inability to perform the procedure in young children due to the small bladder size (<130 ml) . However, this challenge may be overcome with the introduction of the Surgiquest apparatus, which maintains pneumoperitoneum by increasing flow when sensing CO2 leaks. The robotic approach with its three-dimensional visualization appeared to minimize the risk of voiding dysfunction by allowing more careful dissection and avoiding nerve injury . [17▪] reported on 20 patients who underwent extravesical RALUR and performed a case–control comparison with 17 patients who underwent extravesical OUR. The authors observed that the robotic group had a similar incidence of significant pain, bladder spasms, duration of Foley catheter drainage and hospital stay compared to the OUR group. In addition, two patients in the robotic group had transient (<24 h) urinary retention, and two had a ureteral leak requiring treatment with a Double-J stent. The results indicated that although it is technically feasible to perform extravesical RALUR, there is not a significant reduction in morbidity compared to extravesical OUR. Moreover, RALUR is still in its infancy and as with any surgical procedure, the complication rate and severity will likely decrease with greater experience. The laparoscopic approach is well tolerated and offers significant advantages over open surgery including decreased postoperative pain, shorter hospitalization and improved cosmesis. As this procedure does not require complex laparoscopic skills such as intracorporeal suturing, the application of robotics may seem costly and unnecessary. However, the RAL approach may be advantageous when performing partial nephrectomy, a more technically demanding procedure. In addition, it may be ideal for teaching robotic surgery as nephrectomy is a relatively simple ablative procedure that does not require significant reconstructive capabilities and, thus, can provide training for more complex procedures . reported on a series of 72 RAL nephrectomies. Thirty-nine were performed via an open approach, 11 with conventional laparoscopy (CL), 11 with single site laparoscopy and 11 with robotic assistance . The authors observed that the minimally invasive modalities were associated with shorter lengths of hospital stay and decreased postoperative pain medication usage but longer operative times when compared to open surgery. Similar operative times, postoperative use of pain medication and length of hospital stay were noted among the three minimally invasive modalities. It can be performed through a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. Given the limited space of retroperitoneum that could potentially restrict the placement and movement of the robotic system, many pediatric urologists prefer to perform the procedure transperitoneally. reported on nine patients who underwent transperitoneal RAL heminephrectomy. There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, one child developed an asymptomatic urinoma, which was treated with percutaneous drainage. Anecdotally, those surgeons who utilized the robotic system for this procedure believe that it is easier to perform than CL, especially during the mobilization of the upper pole ureter away from the lower pole vasculature. Consequently, it remains to be seen whether RAL has significant advantages over the CL approach for performing partial nephrectomy. This is principally due to the high technical complexity of the procedures with the associated steep learning curve and high potential for complications. RALS has allowed for more rapid advancement of performing these procedures less invasively. Nevertheless, this experience is still limited, and only small series and case reports have been reported in the literature. The authors did not have any intraoperative complications or require conversions to open surgery. They did, however, have one patient who developed a postoperative wound infection. subsequently reported on a series of 10 patients with neuro or myogenic bladder who underwent RAL appendicovesicostomy. One surgery required open conversion due to an inadequate appendix discovered during the procedure. Another developed urinary leakage postoperatively and required an open revision. Minor incontinence developed in two patients, one was corrected with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid injection and one resolved without intervention. The authors concluded that the procedure was feasible to perform and had satisfactory outcomes and minimal complications. were the first to report the use of RALS for performing enterocystoplasty in an ovine model, defining the techniques and pitfalls. One patient required conversion to open surgery due to failure to progress. Postoperatively, three patients required revision of their stoma at the skin level for stomal stenosis. The cost of RALS is the principal limitation in the widespread adoption of this surgical approach. compared the cost of robotic fundoplication to that of open surgery and CLS. Despite the cost of the longer operative times, the shorter hospitalization associated with RALS accounted for the lower cost when compared to open surgery. The difference between RALS and CLS was primarily due to the cost of robotic instruments that have a limited number of uses. However, the cost savings were not achieved by varying the length of stay when amortized costs of the robotic system were included. Patients were matched based on surgery type, age and fiscal year. Direct internal costs from the institution were used to compare the two surgery types across several procedures including pyeloplasty and ureteral reimplant. When estimates of the indirect costs of robot purchase and maintenance were included, open surgery had a lower total cost. Consequently, the authors’ conclusions are limited to procedures in which RALS is the only minimally invasive alternative available. In this case, superiority is not only based on clinical outcomes such as success and complication rates but also on durability of the success and cost. It provides the added benefits of enabling the performance of complex reconstructive procedures such as pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplantation and enterocystoplasty, which are too technically demanding for CLS.

Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must perform 150 to 250 procedures to become adept in their use. During the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie-ups and surgical staffs keeping patients \n\n The first report of robotic surgery in gynecology was published in 1999 from the Cleveland Clinic The adoption of robotic surgery has contributed to the increase in minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic disease. Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery and the rate of complications may be higher, but there are not enough high-quality studies to know at the present time. In the United States, robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions was shown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy in 2015, with no difference in overall rates of complications. This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic oncology. Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids, abnormal periods, endometriosis, ovarian tumors, uterine prolapse, and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies. Articles in the newly created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon's experience. Complications related to robotic surgeries range from converting the surgery to open, re-operation, permanent injury, damage to viscera and nerve damage. From 2000 to 2011, out of 75 hysterectomies done with robotic surgery, 34 had permanent injury, and 49 had damage to the viscera. Prostatectomies were more prone to\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Bio-T-Gel (testosterone gel) is a product that was approved in February 2012 for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone) in conjunction with a medical condition like undescended testicles, chemotherapy side effects, or brain disorders. These problems are so common, it is no wonder that prescriptions for testosterone have increased five-fold since 2000 — yet only 50% of men actually have hypogonadism. Evidence linking testosterone and heart problems has been growing since at least 2009, when researchers halted a clinical trial after 7% of men on testosterone had a cardiovascular event, compared to 1% on a placebo. Since then, numerous studies have backed up these findings. One study found that men over 65 had twice as many heart attacks as men who did not take testosterone. Another study found that men on testosterone were nearly 30% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular event in the first 90 days of treatment. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. Due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial (a National Institute of Aging randomized trial) was halted early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. On January 31, 2014, reports of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths in men taking FDA-approved testosterone-replacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating the issue. Later, in September 2014, the FDA announced, as a result \n\nUse of Testim gel may have contributed to heart attack, stroke or other serious side effects or resulted in death. Many Testim lawsuits have already been filed against Endo for injuries caused by the testosterone gel. Testosterone regulates growth and the development of male gender characteristics. When applied topically, Testim gel increases bone density, muscle growth and libido, enhances sexual function and increases energy levels. The formulation was designed for use in men aged 18 and older who do not produce enough natural testosterone due to a malfunction of the testes, known as hypogonadism. Unfortunately, many men have been prescribed testosterone gel and replacement therapy for age-related decline of male hormones or “low-T” which has been a popular advertising subject. This use of testosterone is not approved by the FDA and may increase the chance for serious complications. It was approved in 2002 as a 1% testosterone gel formulation to be applied to the skin on a daily basis. The studies showed that men who are treated with hormone supplement therapy may experience heart attack or stroke at a three times greater rate than those who do not take the medications. March 2015, the FDA ordered Testim and other testosterone manufacturers to update product labels with information about an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the country and is found in twelve states in Eastern America. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n For a person or pet to acquire a tick-borne disease requires that the individual gets bitten by a tick and that the tick feeds for a sufficient period of time. Lyme disease or borreliosis ; Organism: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (bacterium) ; Vector: at least 15 species of ticks in the genus Ixodes, including deer tick (Ixodes scapularis (=I. dammini), I. pacificus, I. ricinus (Europe), I. persulcatus (Asia)) ; Endemic to: The Americas and Eurasia ; Symptoms: Fever, arthritis, neuroborreliosis, erythema migrans, cranial nerve palsy, carditis, fatigue, and influenza-like illness ; Treatment: Antibiotics - amoxicillin in pregnant adults and children), (doxycycline in other adults ; Relapsing fever (tick-borne relapsing fever, different from Lyme disease due to different Borrelia species and ticks) ; Organisms: Borrelia species such as B. hermsii, B. parkeri, B. duttoni, B. miyamotoi ; Vector: Ornithodoros species ; Regions : Primarily in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia in and certain areas of Canada and the western United States \n\nWith summer approaching and more people hiking or simply enjoying the Southern California sunshine, concerns about blood-sucking ticks spreading Lyme disease are real. The western blacklegged tick is the most common variety found in California. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. Prevention and early detection are part of the safety protocol extended by the California Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as vector control and county health departments. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. For example, from 1985 to 2013, the CDH collected 15,236 ticks in Los Angeles County, 5,973 in Riverside County, 917 in San Bernardino County and 866 in Orange County. The number of reported cases of Lyme disease are low. So far in 2018, 23 confirmed cases have been reported in California. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease. Confirmed cases vary from 0 to 8 per year and many of those are from people who visited places outside of Southern California. Only about 1 percent of the ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi. The CDC recently reported the number of cases nationwide of illnesses from tick, mosquito and flea bites has tripled from 2004 to 2016. And new studies say global climate change may be increasing the range of disease-carrying ticks and the amount of time they are active. It usually takes 24 hours for the tick to transmit the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Both Riverside County and the Greater Los Angeles Vector Control District do not look for ticks. “We actually discontinued routine tick collections/testing a few years ago to focus our resources on mosquito control and West Nile virus surveillance which is a much higher priority here in Southern California,” wrote Keith Jones, deputy director of the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health in an emailed response. “We always wrestle with that question: What risk do we have for Lyme disease for people who go hiking,” said Kelly Middleton, spokesperson for the Greater LA district. Orange County has a very low prevalence for Lyme disease. In the last 10 years, 5,000 ticks were tested for B. burgdorferi and only one sample was positive, said Lora Young, spokesperson for the Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District. “When the tick feeds on the lizard, they have a chemical in their blood which makes the bacteria no longer viable,” Young said. So the tick no longer has the ability to spread the disease, she said. Ixodes pacificus, or the western blacklegged tick, has been found in 56 of 58 California counties. In some parts of the state, more people are infected by nymphs than adult ticks.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

One of the 2011 outbreaks also was in Indiana. Dr. Jorge Parada, professor of medicine and direction of the infection prevention and control program at Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago, said the reason for the increased cases of measles in the U.S. was reduced rates of vaccination. Transmission had occurred in Indiana this year in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccinated status, according to Indiana health department spokeswoman Amy Reel. According to the 2010 CDC National Immunization Survey, over 92 percent of Indiana children aged 19-35 months have at least one dose of the MMR or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The Adams County case has been traced to an unvaccinated person travelling to a country where measles is prevalent, according to the state health department. State and county Health Departments were investigating the new case to prevent further transmission. While no longer infectious, officials warn that people who visited the Bluffton Regional Medical Center on February 20 may have been exposed to the disease when the measles sufferer went to the emergency room that evening. No additional cases have been reported as a result of the Super Bowl Village exposure. Three-quarters of all U.S. measles cases last year were transmitted locally, within the United States, rather than being picked up in another country. Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox. Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite Hispanic and African American children under 5 years old. In April, the CDC reported that 400,000 fewer doses of measles vaccine were ordered in 2020 compared to the same time last year. May 2017 saw a return of measles to the US after an outbreak in Minnesota among unvaccinated children. Another outbreak occurred in the state of New York between 2018 and 2019, causing over 200 confirmed measles cases in mostly ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in New Jersey and Washington state with over 30 cases reported in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely.

It is often associated with inflammation and has many potential causes, including an acute infection in the mother, exposure to environmental toxins, or chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The new test screens for 25 biomarkers of inflammation and immune system activation, as well as for levels of proteins that are important for placenta development. Combined with information on other risk factors, such as the mother’s age and income, the test can predict whether a woman is at risk for preterm birth with more than 80 percent accuracy. In the highest risk pregnancies—preterm births occurring before 32 weeks or in women with preeclampsia, a potentially fatal pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure in the mother—the test predicted nearly 90 percent of cases. The researchers also wanted to be able to identify risk for preeclampsia, which is not included in current tests for preterm birth. Based on a woman’s probability of preterm birth derived by the test, she could discuss with her clinician how best to follow-up and try to lower her risk. Some cases of preterm birth, including those caused by preeclampsia, can be prevented or delayed by taking aspirin, but treatment is most helpful if started before 16 weeks. Physicians could also evaluate high-risk women for underlying infections that may have gone undetected but could be treated. For others, close monitoring by their doctor could help flag early signs of labor like cervical shortening that can be staved off with progesterone treatment. A test for preterm birth is currently available, but it is expensive and only screens for spontaneous preterm birth, not for signs that could lead to indicated preterm births or for preeclampsia. ; A novel biomarker for pre-eclampsia, 4-hydroxyglutamate, improves current first-trimester prediction of the preterm disease. But sometimes delivery occurs sooner than expected. Strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend all prenatal checkups. While the majority of premature births result from unexpected, spontaneous preterm labor (often following premature rupture of the membranes), 20 percent are early inductions due to pregnancy complications such as vaginal bleeding; uterine abnormalities; as well as health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and urinary tract infections. In such cases, early delivery may be the safest route for mother and baby. Because many of these conditions are often symptomless, they are difficult to prevent and diagnose in pregnancy. Women who smoke, drink, or use illegal drugs may also have a higher risk of delivering prematurely. Unfortunately, there are additional inborn factors that may increase your risk of preterm labor. There are now treatments to help prevent preterm labor in certain high-risk women. When present in late pregnancy (between 22 and 34 weeks), fibronectin may indicate the possibility of preterm delivery. These diagnostic tests can accurately determine which women with contractions are unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. Though these options can't completely prevent preterm birth, a group of drugs called tocolytics can now delay delivery for two to seven days. Tocolytics have been shown to be most effective when given early in labor. If you are less than 34 weeks pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with corticosteroids. These drugs work to speed the maturation of your baby's lungs and can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications and death. Corticosteriods are administered as maternal injections and have proven to be most effective when given at least 24 hours before delivery. Could This Drug Be the Solution to Preventing Pre-Term Birth for Good? All women of childbearing age are offered pregnancy testing, as some of them do not know they are carrying a child until many months into pregnancy. The clinic invests significant effort into counseling pregnant women, and providing prenatal care and vitamins. These tests don't directly detect hypoxia, but instead detects the general well-being of the baby and ensures that the baby is healthy since hypoxia causes a wide range of responses. These tests can include prenatal testing, such as fetal movement and amniotic fluid levels, Doppler examination, or fetal heart rate. Another risk factor is premature birth in which medical intervention, such as premature birth prevention or C-section delivery, can be used as prevention for intrauterine hypoxia. Studies have shown a connection between tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency and hypoxia-ischemia brain injury, though further studies need to be done. Measuring fetal BH4 levels can be another way to look out for intrauterine hypoxia. During birth, birth asphyxia can occur in which cardiotocograph can be used to monitor the baby's health during labor.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use\n\nChondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects;  it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects\nClinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety.

Since only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced in a partial knee replacement, the surgery is less invasive compared to a total knee replacement. Because a partial knee replacement involves a smaller incision and preserves healthy bone and cartilage in the rest of the knee, patients typically experience less pain after the procedure compared to a full knee replacement. Partial knee replacement also tends to involve less blood loss compared to a full knee replacement. Therefore, it is essential to consult with an orthopedic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment option based on an individual's specific condition and needs. Moreover, UKAs may require a smaller incision, less tissue damage, and faster recovery times. In the United States, the procedure constitutes approximately 8% of knee arthroplasties. In comparisons with a more extensive surgical procedure called high tibial osteotomy, UKA has equal or better outcomes. Background\nIn the early 1950s, Duncan C. McKeever theorized that osteoarthritis could be isolated to only one compartment of the knee joint, and that replacement of the entire knee might not be necessary if only one knee compartment were affected. Also, choosing the best-suited people was emphasized to ensure that surgeons followed the indications and contraindications for partial replacement. Proper selection, following the indications/contraindications, and performing the surgery well are key factors for the success of UKA. Indications and contraindications\nUKA may be suitable for people with moderate joint disease caused by painful osteoarthritis or traumatic injury, a history of unsuccessful surgical procedures or poor bone density that precludes other types of knee surgery. The doctor may take some radiographs (e.g., x-rays) to check for degeneration of the other knee compartments and evaluate the knee. Surgical information\nThe surgeon may choose which type of incision and implant to use for the subject's knee. The surgeon may decide to check if the appropriate amount of bone was removed during the surgery. The procedure offers several benefits for patients with a moderately active lifestyle, who have arthritis in just one knee compartment, and who are within normal weight ranges. The partial replacement does not disrupt the knee cap, which makes for a shorter rehabilitation period. The hospitalization time compared with a total knee replacement is also greatly reduced. Benefits\nThe potential benefits of UKA include a smaller incision because the UKA implants are smaller than the total knee replacements, and the surgeon may make a smaller incision. Another potential benefit is less post-operative pain because less bone is removed. Also, a quicker operation and shorter recovery period may be a result of less bone being removed during the operation and the soft tissue may sustain less trauma. In 2018, two of the most significant benefits of UKA or partial knee replacements are:\n1. Partial knee replacement subjects report that their replaced knee feels more like their original non-replaced knee as compared to a total knee replacement\n2, Partial knee replacements leave other options open to further advances. By not replacing the rest of the knee with metal and plastic, if other options exist in years to come for arthritis in these areas then a partial knee replacement does not burn that bridge. Individual factors (e.g., anatomy, weight, prior medical history, prior joint surgeries) should be addressed with the surgery subject. The causes of long-term failure of UKAs include polyethylene wear, loosening of the implant, and degeneration of the adjacent knee compartment. Moreover, UKAs may require a smaller incision, less tissue damage, and faster recovery times. In the United States, the procedure constitutes approximately 8% of knee arthroplasties.

Surgical information\nThe surgeon may choose which type of incision and implant to use for the subject's knee. The surgeon removes bone from the (tibia) and thigh bone (femur). The surgeon may decide to check if the appropriate amount of bone was removed during the surgery. The procedure offers several benefits for patients with a moderately active lifestyle, who have arthritis in just one knee compartment, and who are within normal weight ranges. The partial replacement does not disrupt the knee cap, which makes for a shorter rehabilitation period. The hospitalization time compared with a total knee replacement is also greatly reduced. Benefits\nThe potential benefits of UKA include a smaller incision because the UKA implants are smaller than the total knee replacements, and the surgeon may make a smaller incision. Another potential benefit is less post-operative pain because less bone is removed. Also, a quicker operation and shorter recovery period may be a result of less bone being removed during the operation and the soft tissue may sustain less trauma. In 2018, two of the most significant benefits of UKA or partial knee replacements are:\n1. Partial knee replacement subjects report that their replaced knee feels more like their original non-replaced knee as compared to a total knee replacement\n2, Partial knee replacements leave other options open to further advances. By not replacing the rest of the knee with metal and plastic, if other options exist in years to come for arthritis in these areas then a partial knee replacement does not burn that bridge. Individual factors (e.g., anatomy, weight, prior medical history, prior joint surgeries) should be addressed with the surgery subject. The causes of long-term failure of UKAs include polyethylene wear, loosening of the implant, and degeneration of the adjacent knee compartment. Moreover, UKAs may require a smaller incision, less tissue damage, and faster recovery times. In the United States, the procedure constitutes approximately 8% of knee arthroplasties. In comparisons with a more extensive surgical procedure called high tibial osteotomy, UKA has equal or better outcomes. Background\nIn the early 1950s, Duncan C. McKeever theorized that osteoarthritis could be isolated to only one compartment of the knee joint, and that replacement of the entire knee might not be necessary if only one knee compartment were affected. Also, choosing the best-suited people was emphasized to ensure that surgeons followed the indications and contraindications for partial replacement. Proper selection, following the indications/contraindications, and performing the surgery well are key factors for the success of UKA.

According to a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, heavy marijuana use is linked to decreased dopamine release in the brain. This finding is similar to what is observed in heavy cocaine and heroin use. However, chronic drug use, including heavy marijuana use, can blunt the release of dopamine during the chronic phase of drug dependence. In the study mentioned, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the release of dopamine in the brains of marijuana users. They found that heavy marijuana users had decreased dopamine release compared to healthy controls. It is important to note that this study was conducted on heavy marijuana users who were heavily dependent on the drug, and the effects of moderate or occasional use were not specifically investigated. Additionally, the study focused on the acute effects of marijuana abstinence in heavy users. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of heavy marijuana use on the brain's dopamine system and to examine potential differences in effects based on frequency and duration of use. It is also important to consider individual factors such as genetics and other co-occurring conditions that may influence the brain's response to marijuana use. If you have concerns about heavy marijuana use or its potential effects on the brain's dopamine system, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist who can provide personalized guidance and support. In addition, while there are no fatal overdose cases linked to marijuana, there are deaths linked to synthetic cannabinoids each year. However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. Now, a recent study reveals that heavy marijuana use could compromise the dopamine system. Heavy marijuana use is linked with decreased dopamine release in the brain, researchers say. The researchers, who publish their work in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, say that heavy cocaine and heroin use have been shown to decrease dopamine release, but until now, such data regarding cannabis was notably absent. To further investigate whether marijuana dependence is linked with similar effects, the researchers conducted their study in 11 adults aged 21-40 years who were heavily dependent on marijuana, and they matched them with 12 healthy controls. The adults in the marijuana group started using it at around age 16 on average, became dependent by age 20 and had been dependent for around 7 years. During the study, the marijuana users stayed in the hospital for a week, during which they abstained from using it. Results showed that, compared with the control group, the marijuana users' striatum had lower dopamine release. \"We don't know whether decreased dopamine was a preexisting condition or the result of heavy cannabis use. But the bottom line is that long-term, heavy cannabis use may impair the dopaminergic system, which could have a variety of negative effects on learning and behavior.\" The researchers conclude their study by noting that the lower dopamine release is linked with inattention and negative symptoms in marijuana users, and with \"poorer working memory and probabilistic category learning performance\" in both groups. \"Marijuana use may reduce dopamine in the brain.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer? So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent. But several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.The men, ages forty-four to seventy-nine, did not have prostate cancer when the study started in 1990.Ten years later, 2,074 men from the entire study group (those taking statins and those not taking them) had developed prostate cancer.Platz and colleagues found that men who took the cholesterol-lowering drugs had no difference in the risk of early, curable prostate cancer. Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC)  but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer. Feb. 18, 2008 (San Francisco) -- Men with prostate cancer who take cholesterol-lowering statin drugs or anti-inflammatory drugs live longer than those who don't take the drugs, a new study suggests. \"We found an association between both statin and NSAID use and the risk of dying of any cause,\" says researcher Matthew Katz, MD, of Saints Medical Center in Lowell, Mass. Both treatments are effective, with a high cure rate in localized disease. The researchers defined medication use as any use of the drugs after surgery or radiation treatment. Taking statins or NSAIDs within 12 months after prostate cancer treatment did not extend lives, Katz tells WebMD. \"The study highlights the potential health benefits of statins and NSAIDs in prostate cancer survivors,\" he says. While the studies were not designed to examine how statins might protect cancer patients, other research has suggested that statin drugs keep prostate cancer cells from growing in the test tube.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A phase 3 SAMURAI trial of lasmiditan, a serotonin receptor agonist that targets 5-HT1F receptors without vasoconstriction, found the drug was effective and well tolerated for acute migraine among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The study found that significantly more patients who took lasmiditan (at 100 and 200 mg) were free from headache pain and such symptoms as nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia at two hours after treating a migraine attack. Lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors, including those expressed at the trigeminal pathway, and it has been designed for the acute treatment of migraine without the vasoconstrictor activity associated with some migraine therapies, explained Kraig Kinchen, MD, senior medical director of migraine and related therapeutics at Eli Lilly and Company. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, Dr. Kinchen said. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was published in Neurology on November 16, just two days after Eli Lilly announced its submission of lasmiditan to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults with or without aura. But they also noted that the drug did have other related side effects, which some patients may not find tolerable. The researchers, led by Bernice Kuca, BA, MS, head of clinical and regulatory operations at CoLucid, tracked 1,856 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura who had three to eight migraine attacks per month and moderate disability, as assessed by a Migraine Disability Assessment score greater than or equal to 11. In the 11-week study, the team randomized patients to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and asked patients to treat their next migraine attack within four hours of onset. He noted, “If I had a patient [who] was worried about cardiovascular risk, even if they tried triptans or not, they might gravitate towards this product. It also depends on the side effect profile.” For example, he said, patients may say they don't like paresthesia, and chest pain and neck discomfort [side effects of triptans], which might cause them to avoid triptan medications. “They may say, ‘I'll take my risk of 15- to 20-percent of dizziness,’” which is a side effect of lasmiditan. Nasim Maleki, PhD, a migraine researcher and assistant professor of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides a new alternative to a population that would otherwise heighten their risk of cardiovascular events with triptans. Kuca B, Silberstein SD, Wietecha L, et al Lasmiditan is an effective acute treatment for migraine: A phase 3 randomized study http://n.neurology.org/content/91/24/e2222. Eli Lilly has filed a new migraine drug, lasmiditan, with the US regulator, the first drug in its class to be reviewed as a treatment for the condition. An oral drug, lasmiditan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1F agonist that Lilly says is distinct from other approved migraine therapies and does not cause constriction of blood vessels. The filing for lasmiditan includes data from two phase 3 single-attack studies (SAMURAI and SPARTAN), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine. In these studies, patients chose their MBS from sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound or nausea. Emgality, from the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist class, was approved by the FDA for preventive treatment of migraine in adults in September. There are no approved preventive treatments for episodic cluster headache in the US. Triptans such as sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and naratriptan are 5-HT1B receptor agonists that are used to abort migraine and cluster headache attacks. The ergoline antimigraine agent ergotamine also acts on this receptor. Serenics such as batoprazine, eltoprazine, and fluprazine are agonists of the 5-HT1B receptor and other serotonin receptors, and have been found to produce antiaggressive effects in animals, but have not been marketed. Eltoprazine is under development for the treatment of aggression and for other indications. A four-year study of 100 chronic migraine sufferers found that after as few as six 30-minute training sessions, 90% of patients reported significant improvements with their migraines.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

If there is a cow's-milk allergy, occasionally even a breastfed infant may have colic or eczema until milk and dairy foods are eliminated from the mother's diet. Between 2 and 3 out of every 100 children younger than 3 years have allergy symptoms linked to cow's milk. Colic, crying, and gassiness can sometimes be the only manifestation of cow's-milk allergy in very young infants. Of course the most obvious kind of reaction to milk is when the child drinks milk or eats a milk product and immediately develops breathing problems or hives. Most children with cow's-milk allergy are also allergic to milk from goats or sheep, so these are not good substitutes. If your cow's-milk-allergic baby does not tolerate soy formula, your pediatrician may recommend a special formula made of extensively hydrolyzed protein or an amino acid elemental formula.

Experts writing in the July issue of The New England Journal of Medicine noted that historically, pandemic viruses have evolved between seasons, and the current strain may become more severe or transmissible in the coming months. They therefore stressed the importance of international cooperation to engage in proper surveillance to help monitor changes in the virus's behavior, which will aid in both \"vaccine targeting\" and interpreting illness patterns \n\n and declared the outbreak a pandemic.

An article published in The Lancet entitled, “Human infection with avian influenza A H6N1 virus: an epidemiological analysis” discusses the human infection of H6N1.

The subject receives an intravenous injection of radiocontrast, and then the heart is scanned using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing radiologists to assess the extent of occlusion in the coronary arteries, usually to diagnose coronary artery disease. ; Coronary CT calcium scan: also used for the assessment of severity of coronary artery disease. Specifically, it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack. A \n\n patients and 3.2 million patients have drawn attention to high cumulative doses of more than 100 mSv to patients undergoing recurrent CT scans within a short time span of 1 to 5 years. This creates an important issue of cancer risk to these patients. After her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age 63, Patricia Walters talked to her doctor, Leslie Cho, about how to better monitor her own heart health. Easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening, and covered by most insurance, the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart-attack and stroke risk. Research shows that elevated levels of CRP are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels. A 1997 study of healthy physicians, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated CRP levels. While some experts don't think the hs-CRP test adds much to current cardiovascular risk-prediction strategies, others say a large study known as the Jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart trouble—and determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs. The 2008 study showed that in patients with low levels of LDL—the bad cholesterol—but high hs-CRP levels, the statin Crestor reduced the risk of heart-related death, heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by 44% compared with those given placebos. Paul Ridker, a Harvard University researcher who led the Jupiter study, says, \"We know that those with elevated hs-CRP are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low, and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group.\" Cho at the Cleveland Clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment. \"But if your CRP was elevated, I would want to talk to you about the Jupiter results\" and discuss starting a statin. She also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss, nutrition and exercise. She now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly. The studies, being published in The New England Journal of Medicine, provide the strongest evidence yet that the protein - known as CRP, for C-reactive protein - plays a role in heart disease. The participants were patients with severe heart disease who were taking high doses of statin drugs, which reduce both cholesterol and CRP. Lower CRP levels, the researchers found, were linked to a slower progression of atherosclerosis and fewer heart attacks and deaths. \"What we now have is hard clinical evidence that reducing CRP is at least as important as lowering cholesterol,\" said Dr. Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the lead author of one of the studies. But other heart disease researchers cautioned that more work was needed to prove that CRP directly causes heart disease. And most agreed that because the new studies involved only people with severe heart disease, it remained unknown whether healthy people would benefit from reducing their CRP levels. Of people stricken by heart attacks, half have normal cholesterol readings. The second study, by Dr. Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic and his colleagues, asked whether CRP independently predicted heart disease progression. Some heart disease experts said the new studies offered persuasive evidence that doctors should focus on keeping CRP levels low in patients with severe heart disease. \"This is missing-link evidence,\" said Dr. Sidney Smith, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who is a past president of the American Heart Association and co-chairman of a committee of the heart association and the American College of Cardiology that sets treatment guidelines. Others, though, said CRP could instead be a marker for something else being fought by statin drugs to reduce heart disease risk. But we need to recognize that the relationship between CRP and heart disease is a developing story. Even before the new findings, evidence had been mounting that CRP and heart disease were somehow linked. Scientists have developed hypotheses to explain why, proposing that the protein could cause plaque to develop in coronary arteries, lead plaque to burst open or bring on the formation of blood clots that then block arteries and cause heart attacks. Patients with chronic inflammation also have an increased risk of heart disease. Then, about half a century ago, doctors noticed that after a heart attack, CRP flooded the patient's blood, and for a while the protein was used to help diagnose heart attacks. Dr. Ridker's study involved 3,745 patients who had been hospitalized with heart attacks or with severe chest pain from the blocking of coronary arteries and who were then followed for two and a half years. Would there be fewer heart attacks and deaths among people in the study with lower levels of the protein? Dr. Ridker said he would have been happy to find a benefit in lowering CPR levels that was only 10 percent or 20 percent that of lowering cholesterol, adding, \"We never dreamed we'd get a risk reduction as large as the risk reduction from lowering LDL cholesterol\" - that is, the \"bad\" type of cholesterol. Dr. Nissen's study, sponsored by Pfizer, examined plaque in the coronary arteries of 502 patients with heart disease, comparing intense statin therapy against moderate and using the same doses of the same drugs as in Dr. Ridker's research. But he also suspected that something else was going on, because some patients seemed to be doing much better than others with the same cholesterol levels. \"I'm looking right at the plaque, and when your CRP level is reduced, you are stopping the disease,\" Dr. Nissen said. \"We are saying that CRP is a direct participant in atherosclerosis.\" The next step, Dr. Ridker said, is to see if reducing CRP levels can prevent heart attacks in healthy people. \"What these two papers are saying is that not only is CRP a risk factor on its own, but we should be aggressively treating it,\" said Dr. Valentin Fuster, former president of the American Heart Association and director of the cardiovascular institute at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. But Dr. Daniel Rader, a heart disease researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, said this might not be so easy in patients already doing everything possible. \"You've already counseled them about lifestyle, you've already given a statin, you're already targeting LDL cholesterol to less than 70,\" a very low level that is recommended by the current guidelines, he said. \"So if you find a high CRP, what do you do? Most patients with severe heart disease are not taking high doses of statins, he said, so there is room for doctors to experiment with higher doses and different drugs to reduce CRP levels if necessary. New blood tests that doctors hoped would more accurately predict which patients are headed for a heart attack or a stroke are no better than cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other conventional measurements, a study has found. In recent years, doctors have had high hopes over substances in the blood that appeared to be powerful new predictors of a heart attack. An increasing number of family doctors have been ordering tests for these substances in hopes of identifying people who do not have the standard risk factors but are still likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke. But the new research, by scientists at the highly regarded Framingham Heart Study, found that tests of C-reactive protein, B-type natriuretic peptide, homocysteine and seven other substances are only a couple of percentage points better at predicting outcomes than the standard risk factors that doctors have known for decades. \"It's a little bit disappointing,\" said the lead author, Dr. Thomas J. Wang, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor. The study is being published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. But standard risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, family history, advanced age, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and diabetes, were just as accurate as predictors of possible heart attack or stroke. \"This really supports the value of focusing on risk factor reduction, not looking for a magic blood test,\" said Dr. Richard Stein, who is the director of preventive cardiology at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. He predicted that some insurance companies will soon start telling doctors to limit such tests, which are not covered by some insurers. The study, presented Sunday at an American Heart Association convention in New Orleans and published online in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the risk of heart attack was more than cut in half for people who took statins. Because heart disease is a complex illness affected by many risk factors — including smoking, hypertension, being overweight and having a family history of heart disease — most researchers said high CRP alone should not justify prescribing statins to people who have never had heart problems. Some experts cautioned against testing people for CRP unless they had other indications of being at risk for heart disease, and they said more research was needed to pinpoint the patients for whom the benefit of statins outweighs the risks. Others recommended testing more frequently and using statins for people with low cholesterol if they have high CRP and some other risk factors. Dr. Nabel said national panels were likely to revise their official guidelines for doctors, which she described as “silent on CRP,” to recommend CRP testing and statin therapy for some people not previously considered candidates. Several experts said that although the research was significant and would affect clinical practice, the study as published in the journal did not give enough detailed information to indicate exactly which patients should now be tested for CRP or given statins. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Mark A. Hlatky, a professor of health research at Stanford University, said among other things that the study, which tested people with CRP levels over two milligrams, did not indicate whether that level or a higher CRP level should be the threshold for treatment. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the health research group for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, said the Jupiter study also did not give enough detail about the effect of statins on participants who had only high CRP, compared with those who also smoked or had a condition called metabolic syndrome. The role of CRP and inflammation in heart disease is hotly debated. Dr. Ridker believes inflammation plays an important role, probably by causing plaque in the coronary arteries to rupture. Dr. Scott Grundy, a heart expert at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, pointed out that in the Jupiter study, the statin not only lowered CRP but also significantly cut already low cholesterol levels, raising questions about whether the benefit actually came from giving patients superlow cholesterol. The conference highlighted recent advances in the treatment, management, and prevention of cardiovascular diseases with presentations focusing on novel drugs and surgical approaches to improve quality of care for patients. In one study, Serena Day, M.D., of The Ohio State University in Columbus, and colleagues reported a 436 percent increase in hospital admissions at one medical center between 2012 and 2017 for infective endocarditis related to intravenous drug use. In another study, Matthew Kronish, M.D., of the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, and colleagues found that patients who suffered a heart attack or unstable angina and underwent screening for depression and were referred to treatment when appropriate did not demonstrate a significant improvement in quality of life compared with those who did not receive depression screening. Robert Avram, M.D., of the University of California in San Francisco, and colleagues demonstrated that a smartphone application that measures heart rate using a phone’s camera may help detect vascular changes tied to diabetes. The investigators found that the model correctly identified people suffering from diabetes in more than 72 percent of the cases (sensitivity) using the PPG signal alone. THURSDAY, March 21, 2019 — Only a small proportion of recommendations in major cardiovascular society guidelines are supported by evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or a single large RCT, according to a study published in the March 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. WEDNESDAY, March 20, 2019 — For patients with atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation does not significantly reduce the risk for death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest, but it does improve quality of life versus medical therapy, according to two studies published online March 15 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The research was published to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans.

MONDAY, March 18, 2019 — Few patients are optimally adherent to statins, although adherence is associated with a reduced risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. THURSDAY, March 7, 2019 — Patients with myocardial infarction at age 40 years or younger have similar long-term all-cause and cardiovascular death rates as patients aged older than 40 years, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. FRIDAY, March 22, 2019 — The benefits of reduced blood pressure following renal denervation surgery are maintained for at least six months, according to a study published online March 17 in Circulation to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. FRIDAY, March 22, 2019 — Recommendations have been developed for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline was published online March 17 in Circulation to coincide with presentation at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. Therefore, it's about 60% likely that you will have some coronary calcification but until the score is determined, the overall predictive significance is nothing more than guesswork. Can the abnormal coronary calcium score be treated? However, a study of 1,005 patients with an abnormal coronary calcium score were treated with aspirin and some with a statin to lower their cholesterol. After four years of treatment, follow-up patients who received a statin had a 7% rate of heart events, such as a heart attack, versus 12% of those which received a placebo. There need to be more studies geared towards determining how the risk can be lowered by specific treatments; however, this study gives a glimpse of the power of finding and treating silent heart disease an early stage. The American College of Cardiology, of which I am a member and Fellow, took a big step forward in 2011 when they commented on coronary calcium CT scans. They released new guidelines for assessment of CV risk in asymptomatic adults. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. \"Because the number of US adults with an intermediate FRS and/or diabetes is substantial, these guidelines mean that many persons should have coronary CT calcium scanning.## \"Bulletproof Your Heart\" Summary\n\n  1.Silent dangerous plaque in heart arteries is almost always calcified\n  2.CT scanners can detect and measure this silent killer in seconds\n  3.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

According to Monitoring the Future, between 2010–2012 and 2014–2016, marijuana usage by eighth and 10th graders increased by 2.0% and 4.1% respectively. The increased potency of marijuana in the USA over the past four decades can be attributed to several factors. One reason is the shift in the source of marijuana supply from foreign to domestic. Growers have learned to manipulate various factors such as lighting, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels to enhance the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in marijuana plants. Changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana also play a role in the perceived increase in potency. Testing artifacts, such as improved testing methods and increased accuracy in measuring THC levels, may contribute to the apparent rise in potency. It's important to note that the potency measurements may not solely reflect the actual increase in THC content but could be influenced by improvements in testing procedures. A study using data from the Potency Monitoring Program found that when adjusting for marijuana quality, the reported increase in THC% between the 1970s and the 2000s is estimated to be about 57-67% as great as initially reported. This suggests that the long-term rise in potency may be slightly overestimated due to data quality issues and the need to account for the quality of the tested marijuana. In conclusion, the increased potency of marijuana in the USA can be attributed to a combination of factors including the shift to domestic cultivation, advancements in cultivation techniques, and changes in testing procedures. to avoid legal restrictions on cannabis, making synthetic cannabinoids designer drugs. These synthetic analogs often have greater binding affinity and greater potency to the CB<sub href=\"Cannabis (drug)\">1 receptors. Synthetic marijuana compounds began to be manufactured and sold in the early 2000s. (1967) reported that pure THC (which had only recently been chemically isolated with its chemical structure identified) had marijuana-like effects (e.g., increased pulse rate (tachycardia) and altered time sense), whether smoked or taken orally. A number of other isolated compounds present in marijuana (cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene) did not show these effects. ; Isbell and Jasinski (1969) compared LSD (1.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, injected intramuscularly) and smoked THC (225 or 250 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, added to a tobacco cigarette). Physical symptoms were quite different (e.g., tachycardia with THC, dilated pupils with LSD), and tolerance to LSD did not cause \n\nCannabis users whose first experience with the drug is with potent “skunk” strains are nearly five times more likely to go on to show signs of dependence, US researchers have said. Researchers found higher concentration of THC, the molecule which causes its psychoactive “high”, increased the likelihood that users would develop cravings or risky drug use that disrupts their day-to-day life. Despite medical or recreational cannabis use being legalised in a growing number of states and countries there is little regulation on potency – even though this is routine for drugs like alcohol which also cause impairment and dependence. “THC has linearly increased over two decades,” said Dr Brook Arterberry, an assistant professor of psychology at Iowa State University who led this research. Increases in THC content have been made possible because of modern growing techniques and in America average levels have risen from 3.5 per cent THC in 1994 to 12.3 per cent in 2012. In the UK high-potency skunk has pushed out virtually all other types, and experts warn that mental health disorders like psychosis are more common in people who use these stronger strains. In annual follow-ups, users who reported that they had started smoking skunk – with an average THC content of 12.3 per cent – were 4.8 times more likely to have one or more symptoms of cannabis use disorder when compared to those smoking a 4.9 per cent strain. Cannabis is not typically thought of as addictive in the same way as heroin, cocaine, or even alcohol, where withdrawal can have serious physical health effects. Public health and safety advocates, including Smart Approaches to Marijuana Action (SAM Action) and its state affiliates, are celebrating a year of victories against the growing marijuana industry as multiple marijuana legalization bills failed from coast-to-coast. In April, HPIL, SAM, and Stephenson High School Students held a press conference highlighting a cost report that found marijuana legalization would cost the state of Illinois upwards of $670 million, far outweighing prospective tax revenues. After this, pro-pot politicians lost traction on their plan and the session ended with no legalization. Earlier in April, pro-pot advocates were ready to declare victory in Connecticut as a bill to legalize marijuana was passed out of committee. Earlier in the year, the Connecticut chapter of SAM (CT-SAM) released a comprehensive cost study finding that marijuana legalization would cost the state $216 million, well exceeding the projected revenue of $113 million. Additionally, they have defeated numerous attempts to expand the number of marijuana dispensaries and have succeeded in establishing local control over pot-related zoning ordinances in towns and cities. Parents and educators across the state weighed in and kept marijuana out of school nurse office when the marijuana industry wanted it. Advocates across the country all came together to push back on Big Marijuana’s attempts to further their addiction-for-profit scheme and together, we notched resounding victories. (Alexandria, VA) - In the past few years, marijuana use is up significantly, by 10%, among 10th graders, and current vaping of marijuana is up 63% for eighth and tenth graders and 53% for twelfth graders, according to new numbers from the largest drug use survey in the United States. Over the past two years, marijuana use among tenth graders rose 10%, a significant increase. Today’s marijuana is especially harmful to adolescents and is known to have a whole host of damaging effects on developing brains. Adolescent marijuana use severely impacts the ability of our youth to learn, greatly increases the risk of serious mental illness, impairs memory, and can even result in a loss of up to eight IQ points. Evidence shows that marijuana – which has skyrocketed in average potency over the past decades - is addictive and harmful to the human brain especially when used by adolescents. In states that have already legalized the drug, there has been an increase in drugged driving crashes, youth marijuana use, and costs that far outweigh pot revenues.These states have seen a black market that continues to thrive, a black market that continues to thrive, sustained disparities in marijuana arrest rates, and tobacco company investment in marijuana.

Both youngsters were treated with cannabis containing the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol (CBD), as well as small amounts of the psychoactive substance tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). But leading paediatricians say they are horrified that many parents now see cannabis as a panacea for their child’s fits. Dr Joseph Symonds, a paediatrician at Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Children and research fellow in paediatric epilepsy genetics at the University of Glasgow, said: ‘We have seen a massive upsurge in the number of parents asking for cannabis, and specifically cannabis with THC, because of the media interest around the children who have responded well to it. hard, moldy marijuanaI bought one of the dispensary’s side-car dab rigs, a butane torch, and shatter testing at over 94% THC.

As it suppressed the rebellion, the Burundian government embarked on a programme of ethnic repression, targeting the country's remaining Hutu elites, including those who had served in government and the military. Ndayahoze disappeared after being summoned to a crisis meeting early in the morning on 30 April. It was later revealed that he had been arrested and executed, making him one of the first Hutu officials to be murdered by the regime during its repression. Burundian officials alleged that under interrogation he admitted to plotting the rebellion against the government with other Hutus. In 1987 the widow of Ndayahoze sought compensation for the murder of her husband and on behalf of other families with members who were victims of the 1972 repression. At the request of the Burundian ambassador, she was barred from the UN headquarters building in New York. She later compiled his writings and published them in a book, Le commandant Martin Ndayahoze, un visionnaire. The COVID-19 pandemic in Burundi is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). The virus was confirmed to have reached Burundi on 25 March 2020. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Burundi indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R t exceeded 1 during the first half of 2021 but diminished to around 0.7 during the second half of 2021. Timeline\n\nMarch 2020\nBurundi's Health Minister Thadée Ndikumana confirmed the country's first two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 on 31 March, Burundi nationals travelling back from Rwanda and Dubai respectively. May 2020\nOn 12 May, the foreign ministry of Burundi addressed a letter to WHO's Africa headquarters, ordering four officials coordinating the coronavirus response to leave the country. The letter said the four individuals \"are declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi\" by 15 May. The health minister reportedly accuses WHO of \"unacceptable interference in [the country's] management of the coronavirus\". On 28 May, First Lady Denise Bucumi-Nkurunziza tested positive for COVID-19. June 2020 \nOn 8 June, late President Pierre Nkurunziza died of what was described as a heart attack in a government statement. However, with government authorities accused of deliberately covering up the scope of the pandemic, and in the wake of unconfirmed reports that his wife was flown to Kenya 11 days before, having contracted COVID-19, some have speculated that the president died of COVID-19.

A team of doctors, under the leadership of Dr. Zahi Hawass, took DNA samples from bone tissue of the eleven mummies to determine a family pedigree and to determine if any familial or pathological diseases caused Tutankhamun's death. It was discovered that Tutankhamun's family had a large number of irregularities. Four of the mummies, including Tutankhamun, were shown to have had malaria. Based on all the data, the study concluded the most likely cause of death for the young king was the combination of avascular necrosis, malaria and a leg fracture. The presence of 130 canes in the tomb was used as evidence to support Hawass's claim that Tutankhamun suffered from a walking impairment. The reasons for his relatively early death are uncertain, but there is no evidence of violence on his mummy. His mummy was found decapitated, but this was likely caused after his death by tomb robbers. The Amun priest carefully reattached his head to his body with the use of linen cloths. It has been suggested that he died from a disease which had \n\n January 1907, the coffin and mummy were investigated in situ. In 2012, Dr Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at Imperial College London, hypothesized that early deaths of Thutmose IV and other 18th Dynasty pharaohs, including Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, were likely a result of familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for the untimely demise of Thutmose IV and could also explain his religious vision described on the Dream Stele as this type of epilepsy is associated with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Section 1115 demonstration waivers for serious mental illness (SMI) and serious emotional disturbance (SED). Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in November 2018 allows states to pay for short-term psychiatric care for adults in IMD settings. In addition, states may also seek Medicaid payment for services provided to individuals 21 years of age or younger in settings that do not meet CMS requirements to qualify for the inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 benefit (commonly referred to as the psych under 21 benefit). In order to receive demonstration approval, states must meet several criteria, including providing access to a continuum of mental health services, use of a utilization review entity, and certain provider requirements. Section 1115 SUD demonstration waivers. CMS guidance issued in November 2017 outlines the parameters for states to obtain a Section 1115 waiver to pay for short-term residential SUD treatment in IMDs. Among other things, criteria address coverage of certain outpatient and residential services, provider requirements, and evaluation and reporting milestones. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-271) created a new state plan option to allow states to pay for care for Medicaid beneficiaries age 21–64 with at least one SUD in certain IMDs. In order for a state to receive state plan approval, several requirements must be meant including coverage of outpatient, residential, and inpatient services, as well as maintenance of effort requirements. Current Medicaid regulations indicate when managed care organizations (MCOs) can pay for treatment in IMDs as an in-lieu of service. Medicaid payment for IMD services under this authority is limited to 15 days per month. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 recently codified this provision (or any successor regulation) into statute. State Medicaid programs are statutorily required to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries and other low income patients. States can make DSH payments for uncompensated care costs at IMDs as long as such payments do not exceed the lesser amount of the amount of DSH funds that the state paid IMDs in fiscal year (FY) 1995 or 33 percent of the state’s FY 1995 DSH allotment for all hospitals. In state plan rate year 2014, states made $2.4 billion in DSH payments to IMDs. Maine made DSH payments exclusively to IMDs and four states (Alaska, Connecticut, Maryland, and North Dakota) spent more than half of their DSH allotments on DSH payments to IMDs. Many states are using multiple authorities to pay for services in these settings. In Arizona, the government can mandate inpatient treatment for anyone determined to be \"persistently or acutely disabled.\" Virtually anyone who suspects that someone has mental problems and needs help could file an application to a state-licensed healthcare agency for a court-ordered evaluation. In Connecticut, someone can be committed only if he or she has \"psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled\". One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. In addition, half of the mentally ill homeless population in the United States also suffers from substance abuse and dependence (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). This combination of mental illness, substance abuse, and poor physical health makes it very difficult for people to obtain employment and residential stability. Better mental health services would combat not only mental illness, but homelessness as well. In a survey by the United States Conference of Mayors (2008), 20% of cities listed better coordination with mental health service providers as one of the top three items needed to combat homelessness. Contrary to popular belief, many homeless people with severe mental illnesses are willing to accept treatment and services. Even if homeless individuals with mental illnesses are provided with housing, they are unlikely to achieve residential stability and remain off the streets unless they have access to continued treatment and services. However, there are still not enough resources to provide adequate services to the homeless population and those at risk for homelessness. Efforts need to be made to ensure that these funds are used appropriately, efficiently, and in ways that will most effectively help the mentally ill homeless population.

One can petition for assisted outpatient treatment along with, or instead of, hospitalization.

Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck. Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several potential anti-cancer products. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable. In 2014, Geron licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech. The unsuccessful results of these clinical trials prompted CancerVax to say it would cut payroll by more than half to roughly 80 employees from 183. As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released. In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO at the time was Geron founder Michael D. West, acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron and later went on to restart the trial. On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans. Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes.

Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose. There is no vaccine for the common cold. The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. These infections have existed throughout human history. Signs and symptoms\n\nThe typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. Progression\nA cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%. Causes\n\nViruses\n\nThe common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds. Transmission\nThe common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. Other\nHerd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. Pathophysiology\n\nThe symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. Diagnosis\nThe distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater benefit is unknown. Management\n\nTreatments of the common cold primarily involve medications and other therapies for symptomatic relief. Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to the placebo effect. In 2009, Canada restricted the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits. The misuse of dextromethorphan (an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries. Intranasal corticosteroids have not been found to be useful. In adults short term use of nasal decongestants may have a small benefit. Antihistamines may improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness. As of 2017 heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit. It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to the head, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, or a minor sore throat. Antibiotics and antivirals\nAntibiotics have no effect against viral infections, including the common cold. Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits. As of 2015, there is weak evidence to support nasal irrigation with saline. Prognosis\nThe common cold is generally mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Severe complications, if they occur, are usually in the very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. Adults typically have two to three infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of symptomatic infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity. History\n\nWhile the cause of the common cold was identified in the 1950s, the disease appears to have been with humanity since its early history. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment could be developed. The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prevention and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment in the history of the unit. Research directions\nAntivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; as of 2009, none had been both found effective and licensed for use. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance.

The three most recorded and common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and coughing, as reported by the World Health Organization. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

For the study, Casadei and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,900 patients who were having elective heart surgery to take Crestor or a placebo before surgery. The researchers found that patients given Crestor had lower levels of cholesterol and C-reactive protein (another marker for heart trouble) after surgery, compared with patients given a placebo. And further analyses showed that Crestor was associated with a 5.4 percent greater chance of mild kidney damage, when compared with a placebo. \"The risk of kidney injury is relatively small, but considering that the benefit of statin treatment before a heart operation is zero, one may well consider stopping statins for a few days before surgery,\" Casadei said. The report was published May 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Current guidelines recommend that all patients with cardiovascular disease, including patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, receive statins to lower the risk of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Beyond the intermediate and long-term benefits of statins, a number of small clinical trials have suggested an additional short-term benefit of starting or continuing statin therapy before heart surgery. In the late 1990s it introduced a statin drug, Baycol (cerivastatin), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy. ; Anesthesia: General anesthetics during surgery may cause bladder atony by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant. Spinal anesthesia shows a higher risk of postoperative urinary retention compared to general anesthesia. Risk factors include\n\nTaking statins in high doses increases the risk of emergency hospital treatment for kidney damage, warn researchers. Those in the high-risk group were taking 40 milligram and higher statin pills. The health records of two million people were used from the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies for those with and without chronic kidney disease. High potency statin users were 34 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with low potency statin users in the first 120 days of treatment. This risk seemed to remain elevated for two years after starting treatment. The researchers estimate that 1,700 patients with no previous kidney problems need to be treated with a high potency statin instead of a low potency statin in order to cause one additional hospitalisation. But the risk could have been ‘underestimated’ they say in a report in the online medical journal bmj.com. The researchers conclude that prescribing high potency statins is ‘associated with an increased rate of hospital admission with AKI compared with lower potency statins’. The risk of type 2 diabetes is raised by 12 per cent with high dose statins compared with moderate doses, according to a study. Lead researcher Professor Colin Dormuth, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said further investigation was necessary to determine how statins might be causing kidney injury. It could be due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, or because use of statins can deplete the body's stores of CoQ10, a naturally-occurring nutrient important for energy production in cells. Some studies suggest statins may protect against health problems, including blood clots, Alzheimer's and eye disorders, by maintaining a healthy supply of blood to the brain.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These toxins can pose a risk to human and animal health. Symptoms of cyanobacteria poisoning can vary depending on the specific toxins produced and the amount ingested. Additionally, exposure to cyanobacteria toxins can cause skin rashes, respiratory irritation, and allergic reactions. Cyanobacteria blooms typically occur in bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, that have high levels of nutrients and warm temperatures. To prevent cyanobacteria poisoning, it is important to avoid exposure to potentially contaminated water sources. This includes avoiding swimming or recreating in water bodies with visible cyanobacteria blooms or scum. It is also advised to not use untreated water for drinking, cooking, or any other purpose if cyanobacteria blooms are present or suspected. If you suspect cyanobacteria poisoning after exposure to contaminated water, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are one of the common causes of water pollution. They can cause cyanobacteria poisoning or cyanide poisoning. Cyanobacteria produce toxins called cyanotoxins, which can contaminate water bodies and pose a threat to humans, animals, and marine life. It's important to note that cyanobacteria poisoning is just one type of water pollution-related poisoning. Each type of poisoning has its own set of symptoms and health consequences. ## Algae Poisoning\n\nToxic freshwater algae, characteristically blue-green in colour, are found in summer on lakes in numerous locations, particularly where water has a high phosphate and nitrate content derived from farm land. The main toxic freshwater cyanobacteria are strains of the unicellular Microcystis aeruginosa, and the filamentous forms Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon and Oscillatoria agardhii. Poisoning by algae has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea off Denmark. Aquatic cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible blooms that can form in both freshwater and marine environments. The blooms can have the appearance of blue-green \n\nAlgae poisoning can have various effects on animals. Algae poisoning has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea and in cattle, sheep, and dogs that have consumed water affected by toxic freshwater algae. For example, some cyanobacteria can produce alkaloid neuromuscular toxins, which can lead to muscular tremors, stupor, prostration, convulsions, and even death. Other cyanobacteria may produce a slower-acting peptide toxin, resulting in symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, thirst, piloerection, lachrymation, and light sensitization with inflamed white skin and edema of the ears and eyelids. It is important to be aware of the potential effects of algae poisoning on animals and take necessary precautions to prevent their exposure.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Temporary restrictions are sometimes called \"deferrals\", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a de facto ban. Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. With regard to blood donation, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) enforces a three-month deferral period for MSM and women who have sex with MSM. In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019. Many LGBT organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on homophobia and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously tested to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes. Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection. The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that \"the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood\". In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that \"new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules\". Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as safe sex practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be monogamous, or be in other low risk categories. Since 1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4 million donations. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include Isaac Asimov, who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery. Current situation\n\nList of countries with their stand on MSM blood donors \n\nThis list shows countries that had restrictions on blood donors. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor. The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3-month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%. He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an \"automatic deferral\" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. In July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004–33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals. The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to \"high risk sexual contact\". The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead. In July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood. New Zealand \nAt the formation of the New Zealand Blood Service (NZBS) in 1998, the deferral period had been 10 years, but was reduced to 5 years in 2009. In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to 1 year following the recommendation of Medsafe. United States \nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues donor deferral recommendations to blood establishments. This policy replaces a previous one year deferral that was approved by the FDA on 21 December 2015, which itself replaced a previous lifetime ban on blood donations from MSM. Females are also prohibited from donating for three months after having sex with an MSM. The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. Donors of human cells and tissues other than organs, such as corneas or reproductive tissue like semen, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact. With regard to corneal donations, the five-year deferral policy in the United States and the similar 12-month deferral policy in Canada have the effect of preventing thousands of corneal donations annually. UNOS policies for organ donation allow for solid organs from MSM donors such as hearts, lungs, and kidneys to be used in transplant surgeries, though they require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years. The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease. History of calls to change the policy \n In 2006, the AABB, American Red Cross, and America's Blood Centers all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population.\" Outraged by the federal policy and disappointed by being refused as a blood donor, Moll-Vigrass started to advocate for change. \"The government’s unfounded policy is hurtful to the people being turned away solely based on sexual orientation and the millions of others who will be in need of a lifesaving blood donation,\" said Higgins. On 27 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months. Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM. Australia \nAustralia implemented a 12-month deferral in 1999; a comparison of confirmed HIV positive blood donations before and after the change did not see a statistically significant difference. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service pushed to have the deferral period lowered from twelve to six months, however it was rejected by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 2014. The spokesperson said they empathise with those who cannot give blood. Reasoning for the restrictions \nBlood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood. Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM due to the marginal increase in the risk for transfusion-transmitted HIV. Other groups with similar restrictions, or complete prohibition to donate blood, due to increased or possible risk for certain infectious diseases include intravenous drug users, recipients of animal organs or tissues, and those who have traveled or lived abroad in certain countries. In the 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic outbreak occurred, there was a high prevalence of the disease on MSM and no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from high-risk groups. These restrictions are similar to current restrictions on people with certain residence in the United Kingdom, France, or Saudi-Arabia during the height of the BSE (\"mad cow disease\") epidemic of 1980 through 1996, due to the absence of a test for its human form, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD). An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. Screening out those at high risk of blood borne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents. Criticism of the restrictions\n\nNeed for blood \nObjections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. However, Canadian Blood Services noted that the national inventory and days on hand of several blood groups remain at critically low levels. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, in some countries, other high-risk activities determine a temporary ban, such as sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor, whereas MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Activism regarding reform of MSM donor policies\n\nStudent and faculty activism on campuses \nIn Canada\n The students association at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus. In 2011, the academic senate of Queens College, City University of New York recommended that all blood drives on campus should cease. The Michigan Daily, the student newspaper of the University of Michigan, editorialized in favor of a loosening of the MSM blood donation policy. There were reported expressions of frustration and disapproval by a number of gay and bisexual men who were forbidden to donate blood to victims, with LGBT activists across the country and a group of Democratic lawmakers urging the ban to be lifted. This resulted in 20 Attorneys General writing to The Department of Health and Human Services asking for the restrictions on MSM blood donations to be lifted. In the United Kingdom\n\n The National Union of Students LGBT Campaign runs a \"Donation Not Discrimination\" campaign to have the blood ban changed, while also advocating continued donation by those who are not banned from donating. United Kingdom \nIn 2015, Welsh writer and poet RJ Arkhipov exhibited a poetry series written with his own blood as ink in protest of the MSM blood donor restrictions. Court cases \nIn 2018 the European Court of Human Rights took up a case of a French citizen who was prevented from donating blood. Yes\n\nBlood donation\nDiscrimination against LGBT people\nFood and Drug Administration\nGay history\nHomophobia\nHistory of HIV/AIDS\nMale homosexuality\nMedical controversies\nLGBT rights\nPatient safety\nSexual orientation and science\nLGBT and society\nTransfusion medicine\n\nMany countries have laws, regulations, or recommendations that effectively prohibit donations of blood or tissue for organ and corneal transplants from men who have sex with men (MSM), a classification of males who engage or have engaged in sex with other males, irrespective of their sexual activities with same-sex partners and of whether they identify themselves as bisexual or gay. Temporary restrictions are sometimes called \"deferrals\", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a de facto ban. Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. With regard to blood donation, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) enforces a three-month deferral period for MSM and women who have sex with MSM. In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019. Many LGBT organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on homophobia and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously tested to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes. Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection. The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that \"the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood\". In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that \"new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules\". Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as safe sex practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be monogamous, or be in other low risk categories. Since 1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4 million donations. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include Isaac Asimov, who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery. Current situation\n\nList of countries with their stand on MSM blood donors \n\nThis list shows countries that had restrictions on blood donors. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor. The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3-month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%. He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an \"automatic deferral\" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. In July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004–33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.

Researchers believe that a blood test may be helpful in determining whether a child has sustained a concussion, as well as determining ithe severity of the problem. A new study found that a blood test correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) 94 percent of the time. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. During the study, researchers performed CT scans on 152 children in the study while comparing the results of the scans with results from the blood tests. While the CT scans helped to identify which patients suffered visible TBIs, the blood test also detected the symptoms of concussions even when the brain injuries were not visible on CT scans. As it stands, most children with concussions are diagnosed by symptoms alone. However, these do not really give doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury. Is There A Link Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Road Rage? Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination by lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap), brain imaging studies, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological testing and similar diagnostic studies may be used to differentiate the various causes of encephalopathy. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. \"This [blood test] could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly,\" she added in a news release from the Florida health care provider. In nearly 600 patients age 18 and older, the blood test detected mild to moderate concussion with up to 97 percent accuracy, the researchers said. \"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa, a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded researcher. An estimated 250,000 U.S. children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports -- nearly 700 a day. As a result, it can be difficult for doctors to determine the severity of the injury, Papa said. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Some animal and human exposures have occurred, and they all are receiving treatment. Four people are receiving post exposure prophylaxis after handling their pets which encountered the skunks. A total of 14 dogs were also exposed. Health officials continue to educate the public about preventing rabies exposure. \"Rabies can infect any mammal,\" said Mark E. Wallace, MD, MPH, executive director of the Weld County Health Department. In past years, domestic bison and horses have contracted rabies, in addition to a variety of wildlife. \"The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated. If you are in direct contact with a rabid animal, such as a skunk or bat, your risk is much higher,\" Wallace said. Rabies can infect many wild animals, including skunks, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and bats. Health officials recommend all domestic animals such as cats, dogs, horses and livestock be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. Yet rabies is still around, present in many mammals, including raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes, and contact with any infected animal can mean infection for you or an unvaccinated furry pet. To make people more aware of the continued threat and precautions to take, national and international health organizations have designated September 28, 2011, as World Rabies Day. Vaccination could reduce or eliminate this risk, and a goal of the World Rabies Day campaign is to ensure more widespread vaccination of dogs. Remember, above all, keep your pets vaccinated against rabies, and stay away from wild animals, especially those known to carry the virus. Rabies transmission from dogs to humans has been known since ancient times. The boy lived and did not develop rabies. Even today, with widespread vaccine campaigns targeting domestic pets, rabies persists in some wild populations, such as bats, where infection rates run about 6%. Where bats occur, health officials struggle to keep the public informed, warning that no bat should ever be touched or handled because of the risk of rabies transmission. One study found that 46% of rabies-related bites came from bats, and the huge majority of these infectious bites occur during the summer months. Other wild animals that carry rabies include foxes, raccoons, skunks, and coyotes. It’s pretty straightforward to avoid contracting rabies, but children in particular need to be educated about the rules: avoid contact with all wild animals known to transmit the disease, including bats, foxes, coyotes, and skunks. Never touch or approach an injured animal, and if you have a domesticated pet, such as a dog or cat, be sure that Spot or Fifi is completely up to date on all vaccines. What is rabies and how do people get it? In 1999, skunks accounted for 21 of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky. Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Confine your pet or otherwise make sure it does not run away. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, or ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to do this, the animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month before being released. Dogs, cats and ferrets with current rabies vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian should be revaccinated immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Vaccination of all dogs, cats and ferrets on the premises protects them from the risk of rabies. Bats accounted for six of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1999. Rabies from bats is the most common source of human infection in the United States. Contact your veterinarian or local animal control personnel for information. Your local health department has proper containers and instructions for submitting an animal specimen for rabies testing. Most fatalities from rabies occur when people fail to seek prompt medical assistance or are unaware of the exposure, as with some of the cases associated with bat rabies. Many countries have a much higher risk of rabies exposure than the United States. In 1998, four cases of rabies in horses were confirmed in Kentucky. Proper and up-to-date vaccination of your pets is your first line of defense against rabies. PROGRAM GOAL: To prevent human cases of rabies by investigating all reported animal bites, and by vaccinating dogs against rabies. The present raccoon rabies epidemic was first confirmed in the Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern states in 1977, and has continued to spread to other states. Hundreds of animal bites are reported in Wayne County each year. Any warm-blooded animal can contract the illness; however, typical wildlife rabies is spread by raccoons, skunks, bats, and fox. In past few years several rabid animals (all bats) have been found in Wayne County. Infected wild animals can pass rabies to pets. Animals which are very rarely affected are rats, mice, squirrels, hamsters, and rabbits. Fortunately, few human cases of rabies are reported (1 case in Ohio since 1970 and 32 cases in the U.S. since 1980). How do I know an Animal is Rabid? Animals who exhibit unusual or abnormal behavior should be considered a risk. Rabid animals may stagger, appear restless, change the tone of their bark or growl, appear to be choking, or become excitable/irritable or aggressive. If bitten or scratched, see your doctor and report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District. Report contacts between your pets and wild animals to your veterinarian. If it can be done safely, try to detain or hold the animal, so it can be quarantined/tested for rabies. Report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District and provide the following information using this Bite Report Form. There is still no cure for rabies once symptoms develop. The disease can be stopped in people, if a series of rabies immunizations are given soon after the exposure to the virus. Recently the Toronto Public Health Services received confirmation of this year’s first positive rabid bat in Hamilton. I am writing this blog regarding rabies in bats, raccoons and other wildlife so you will know what prevention steps to take, learn about the symptoms, steps to take if you are bitten and not to panic! In Canada, common carriers of rabies are bats, raccoon, skunk and foxes. Recently the most human-rabies cases have been contracted by rabies in bats. There are several strains presently in Ontario, there are skunk and fox strains, raccoon strains and bats have several strains. If you get bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, seek treatment immediately from a local physician or hospital. There are several strains in Ontario, to control this the Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) distributes baits for wildlife to eat each year. The bait contains a rabies vaccine that is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Be sure to take the proper precautions when around bats. An animal that has contracted rabies will have flu-like symptoms, severe headache, and fever. In humans early symptoms is numbness or itchiness around the bite area, flu like symptoms and headache progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. Raccoons can pick up various strains of rabies, but they are most susceptible to the raccoon strain. Raccoons are generally a nocturnal animal, so if you spot a raccoon exhibiting abnormal behaviour especially in the day, be alert and keep your distance. As a precaution, all bites or scratches by raccoons should be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus. Raccoons may incubate rabies for long periods (months) without becoming ill. Don’t attract raccoons to your property, consider feeding pets indoors, not over filling bird feeders, cleaning up well after BBQ’s and keeping bins securely closed. Rabid bats accounted for 27 of the 28 rabies cases in 2013. As bats in Canada are insectivores, no efficient way of vaccinating them has yet been found. Local or state health officials should be consulted to help determine if rabies treatment is needed. Ontario law requires that all dogs and cats be vaccinated against rabies and their shots kept up-to-date. To further protect your pets, keep them indoors at night to limit their exposure, the time when foxes, skunks, bats and raccoons are most active. If you encounter a rabid animal keep your distance and call the Rabies Hotline at 1-888-574-6656. Here are some tips on preventing wildlife on your property.

Best management practices suggest the use of corral traps which have the ability to capture the entire sounder of feral pigs. The federal government spends $20 million on feral pig management. In February 2017, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller approved the use of a pesticide called Kaput Feral Hog Lure, which is bait food laced with warfarin (a rodenticide used to kill rodents). On 27 March, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported the symptoms described in affected animals are not \"fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin.\" ; Determine whether shooting at night is safe with reference to the general public, pets, and livestock A DEFRA statement, published in October 2012, stated, \"The aim of this monitoring is to test the assumption that controlled shooting is a humane culling technique.\" The statement makes no indication that the cull would assess the effectiveness of reducing bTB in the trial areas. Researchers with the University of Wisconsin–Madison measured three devices and a press report said they found these three devices produced \"low-pitched and ultrasonic sounds at speeds of 30 to 70 miles per hour; however, researchers were unable to verify that deer responded to the sounds.\" The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) worked in concert with the USDA to identify and eliminate feral swine populations which harbored the ASF virus in Haiti.

Fractures are now listed on the Avandia prescribing information under _Warnings and Precautions:_ \"Increased incidence of bone fracture in female patients.\" **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients. Women, but not men, receiving Actos (pioglitazone) had a higher number of fractures. Increased fracture risk observed in women is now included in the Actos prescribing information under _Precautions._ The full prescribing label includes additional information about fractures that was gathered during the PROACTIVE study (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events). Over an almost-three-year period, women with type 2 diabetes taking Actos had double the number of fractures compared to women on placebo. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs.Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs. Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. In just a matter of a few months, these changes were measured indirectly with bone turnover markers in women. Their markers for building-bone osteoblasts were decreased while markers of bone breakdown were normal. This finding is based on lab mice, but further research in this important area is underway.In a reanalysis of data from a Fosamax trial, it was determined that postmenopausal diabetic women tended to not gain as much bone density as nondiabetics taking Fosamax.Also of note, the diabetics in the placebo group lost bone more rapidly at the hip.Research is needed to guide the design of strategies for improving diabetics' bone health. Studies show an increased risk of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction in premenopausal women with diabetes when compared to women without diabetes. Actos is an equal opportunity Type 2 diabetes drug that causes bladder cancer in men and women. However, women who take Actos for type 2 diabetes not only are at risk for bladder cancer but are also at risk for fractures known as secondary osteoporosis. Type 2 diabetes is manageable with a complementary prescription drug and nutrition. But bladder cancer and bone fractures? At the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, their study aimed to determine the risk of fractures associated with thiazolidinedione therapy and to evaluate the effect on bone density. Interpretation: Long-term thiazolidinedione use doubles the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. In yet another study, there was evidence that both the TZD class of drugs causes bone loss and increase fracture risk, specifically in women. Observational studies using data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort reported that older postmenopausal TZD users experience bone loss at the rate of -0.61% annually compared with non-TZD users. Improvement of bone safety of TZD-based therapy may be achieved by using combination therapy with other anti-diabetic therapies, or preventing bone loss by using available anti-osteoporotic drugs, or development of a new class of selective TZDs, which may have sparing or even beneficial effects on skeleton.

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120 Hz (twice of the utility frequency; the lamp is lit on both the positive and negative half-wave of a cycle). This flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity and are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In 2009, Natural Resources Canada released a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. The report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. At 30 cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. SCENIHR study and report\nThe Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:\nUltraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed. The inner-ear condition Ménière's disease can be aggravated by flicker. Sufferers of vertigo are recommended to not use fluorescent lights. Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. There is evidence that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy, but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Mercury\nFluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb. Mercury can be harmful to children and developing fetuses, so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a broken bulb is cleaned up. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4–5 mg) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer.

The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition. People with COPD are recommended by a number of guidelines to have a pneumococcal vaccination. Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles. Prof. Dr. Jyotsna Joshi asserts the importance of preventive adult vaccinations, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination and also throws light on the schedule for dual vaccination. Physicians treating adult patients have poor awareness of preventive vaccinations. Nevertheless, vaccination is an important aspect of management of respiratory disorders and reduces morbidity and mortality. Adult Respiratory Vaccination, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination is very important and physicians need to be aware of these. This article emphasises the adult respiratory vaccinations, that are given to prevent respiratory diseases or exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. The two main vaccinations in this group consist of pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. The recommendations are largely based on Advisory Committee on Vaccination Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumococcal infections, including pneumonia and invasive disease such as bacteraemia and meningitis, are important sources of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children, older adults (≥65 years of age), and persons with conditions that affect their ability to make antibodies to capsular polysaccharides. Patients with chronic lung disease are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia, and patients with conditions such as heart failure are more likely to have adverse outcomes if pneumonia occurs. Asplenia greatly increases the risk for overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis, and a cerebrospinal fluid leak or a cochlear implant greatly increases the risk for pneumococcal meningitis. Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are approved for use. PPSV is used in selected adults and children ≥2 years of age but not in infants or toddlers <2 years of age since polysaccharide antigens are poorly immunogenic in this age group. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been recommended for many years in for all adults ≥65 years of age and in younger patients who have a condition that increases the risk for developing pneumococcal pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease and/or fatal complications if such infections occur. HIV infection), a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a cochlear implant, or advanced kidney disease. Even if they have not been diagnosed with one of the conditions listed above, they have proven themselves to be susceptible and, therefore, worthy of receiving the vaccine. The CDC recommends 2 pneumococcal vaccines for all adults 65 years or older irrespective of disease or immune status. Administration: Both pneumococcal vaccines are administered as a 0.5 ml dose. Administration with other vaccines: Either formulation of pneumococcal vaccine may be given concomitantly with other vaccines. This recommendation is in accord with some European public health agency recommendations. Revaccination with PCV13 is not recommended for any age group. Since 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons without contraindications aged 6 months or older. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. CDC estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Adults with certain health conditions including heart disease, asthma, COPD, diabetes, a liver or kidney disorder, or a weakened immune system are at especially high-risk for influenza and its complications. Trivalent vaccines include an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and one influenza B virus. Persons aged 65 years or older may receive any age-appropriate IIV formulation (standard dose (SD) or high dose (HD), trivalent or quadrivalent) and vaccination should not be delayed if a specific product is not readily available. If the vaccine recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. If nasal congestion impedes delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral should be considered, or another age appropriate vaccine should be administered. The ACIP continues to advise that individuals with a history of egg allergy of any severity may receive any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate influenza vaccine (IIV4 or LAIV4). However, it is contraindicated in people who have experienced a severe (life threatening) allergy to a prior dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV). Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults. Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the \n\n Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older.

Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, resulting in different presentations for the same disorder. The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms \nFirst-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then. A 2015 systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of first rank symptoms:\n\nDSM-5 \nThe definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes:\n\nSubtype classifications were removed. Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia. Special treatment of Schneider's first-rank symptoms is no longer recommended. The ICD-10 defines seven sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The Russian version of the ICD-10 includes additional four sub-classifications of schizophrenia: hypochondriacal (F20.801), cenesthopathic (F20.802), childhood type (F20.803), and atypical (F20.804). Comorbidities \nPeople with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance. An estimated 21% to 47% of patients with schizophrenia have a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder is significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness. It is estimated that 15% of the population with schizophrenia are late-onset and 5% very-late onset. Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. On the other hand, late-onset cases are less likely to present with formal thought disorder, affective symptoms. Etiology \nThe pathophysiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood. Multiple genetic and environment factors have been associated with increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, response to treatment with anti-psychotic medication is variable, with some patients being resistant to some therapies. Together, the differences in causes, response to treatment and pathophysiology suggest schizophrenia is heterogeneous from an etiological standpoint. The differences resulting from this in terms of in clinical manifestations make the disorder harder to diagnose. Distinct symptomatic sub types of schizophrenia groups show distinct patterns of SNP variations, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Studies also suggest there is a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. These factors complicate the use of genetic tests in diagnosis or prediction of the onset of schizophrenia. Etiological factors of Schizophrenia is at the forefront of current research efforts. For example, children who are exposed to the Rubella virus in utero are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Children who are exposed to the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii are two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and the diagnosis can be predicted as early as one week of life among newborns. Although mothers may not have experienced symptoms of Rubella or Toxoplasma Gondii, higher levels of antibodies associated with these infections during pregnancy is associated to a higher probability that their child will have schizophrenia. The hypothesis states that these alterations in functioning may contribute to the onset of Schizophrenia later in adulthood. Environment\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the environmental risks associated with schizophrenia diagnosis. Those who live in urban areas are at a greater risk of diagnosis  Although  environmental factors may increase the risk, encouraging and supportive communities may decrease the likelihood of schizophrenia. However, epigenetics plays a role in the diagnosis of Schizophrenia as well. Differential diagnosis\n\nIf signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. A general medical and neurological examination may also be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and the Lewy body dementias may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. Currently, no biomarkers that can be widely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of schizophrenia have been identified. Structural alterations have, however, been identified in schizophrenia, most commonly enlarged ventricles, and decreased grey matter volume in the cortex and hippocampus. Studies using functional MRI have also shown that altered connectivity and activity in present in schizophrenia. In the last decade interest has grown in the use of machine learning to automatically perform the diagnosis task using brain imaging data. While these algorithms are very robust at distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects, they still cannot perform the tasks clinicians struggle the most with - differential diagnosis and treatment selection. Since the prevalence of metabolic syndromes is increased in schizophrenia patients, makers of those syndromes have been common targets of research. These effects are generally small, however, and often present only in a subset of patients, which results from the heterogeneity of the disease. Furthermore, these results are often complicated by the metabolic side effects of anti-psychotic medication. Genetic \nEstimates of the heritability of schizophrenia is around 80%, which implies that 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. Although many genetic variants associated with schizophrenia have been identified, their effects are usually very small, so they are combined onto a polygenic risk score. These scores, despite accounting for hundreds of variants, only explain up to 6% in symptom variation and 7% of the risk for developing the disease. An example of a well-studied genetic biomarker in schizophrenia is the single nucleotide polymorphism in the HLA-DQB1 gene, which is part of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.

Diagnostic criteria \nNancy Andreasen has criticized the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for sacrificing diagnostic validity for the sake of artificially improving reliability.

Citing poor interrater reliability, some psychiatrists have totally contested the concept of schizoaffective disorder as a separate entity. The National Institute of Health's Research of Domain Criteria (RDoC) research program, launched in 2009, is perhaps the largest combined effort to address the need for a new approach in classifying mental disorders.

The goal is to develop biologically valid diagnosis by defining nosology based on biological measures instead of symptom profiles, as is done currently. References \n\nSchizophrenia\nPsychiatry controversies\nPsychiatric assessment\n\nThe diagnosis of schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, is based on criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Clinical assessment of schizophrenia is carried out by a mental health professional based on observed behavior, reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, resulting in different presentations for the same disorder. The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms \nFirst-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then. A 2015 systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of first rank symptoms:\n\nDSM-5 \nThe definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes:\n\nSubtype classifications were removed. Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia. Special treatment of Schneider's first-rank symptoms is no longer recommended. The ICD-10 defines seven sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The Russian version of the ICD-10 includes additional four sub-classifications of schizophrenia: hypochondriacal (F20.801), cenesthopathic (F20.802), childhood type (F20.803), and atypical (F20.804). Comorbidities \nPeople with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance. An estimated 21% to 47% of patients with schizophrenia have a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder is significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness. It is estimated that 15% of the population with schizophrenia are late-onset and 5% very-late onset. Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. On the other hand, late-onset cases are less likely to present with formal thought disorder, affective symptoms. Etiology \nThe pathophysiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood. Multiple genetic and environment factors have been associated with increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, response to treatment with anti-psychotic medication is variable, with some patients being resistant to some therapies. Together, the differences in causes, response to treatment and pathophysiology suggest schizophrenia is heterogeneous from an etiological standpoint. The differences resulting from this in terms of in clinical manifestations make the disorder harder to diagnose. Distinct symptomatic sub types of schizophrenia groups show distinct patterns of SNP variations, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Studies also suggest there is a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. These factors complicate the use of genetic tests in diagnosis or prediction of the onset of schizophrenia. Etiological factors of Schizophrenia is at the forefront of current research efforts. For example, children who are exposed to the Rubella virus in utero are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Children who are exposed to the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii are two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and the diagnosis can be predicted as early as one week of life among newborns. Although mothers may not have experienced symptoms of Rubella or Toxoplasma Gondii, higher levels of antibodies associated with these infections during pregnancy is associated to a higher probability that their child will have schizophrenia. When these cells become inflamed, they produce nitric oxide and amino acids, contributing to neuronal death. The hypothesis states that these alterations in functioning may contribute to the onset of Schizophrenia later in adulthood. Environment\n\nSeveral studies have evaluated the environmental risks associated with schizophrenia diagnosis. Those who live in urban areas are at a greater risk of diagnosis  Although  environmental factors may increase the risk, encouraging and supportive communities may decrease the likelihood of schizophrenia. However, epigenetics plays a role in the diagnosis of Schizophrenia as well. Differential diagnosis\n\nIf signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. A general medical and neurological examination may also be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and the Lewy body dementias may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. Currently, no biomarkers that can be widely used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of schizophrenia have been identified. Structural alterations have, however, been identified in schizophrenia, most commonly enlarged ventricles, and decreased grey matter volume in the cortex and hippocampus. Studies using functional MRI have also shown that altered connectivity and activity in present in schizophrenia. In the last decade interest has grown in the use of machine learning to automatically perform the diagnosis task using brain imaging data. While these algorithms are very robust at distinguishing schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects, they still cannot perform the tasks clinicians struggle the most with - differential diagnosis and treatment selection. Since the prevalence of metabolic syndromes is increased in schizophrenia patients, makers of those syndromes have been common targets of research. These effects are generally small, however, and often present only in a subset of patients, which results from the heterogeneity of the disease. Furthermore, these results are often complicated by the metabolic side effects of anti-psychotic medication. Genetic \nEstimates of the heritability of schizophrenia is around 80%, which implies that 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. Although many genetic variants associated with schizophrenia have been identified, their effects are usually very small, so they are combined onto a polygenic risk score. These scores, despite accounting for hundreds of variants, only explain up to 6% in symptom variation and 7% of the risk for developing the disease. An example of a well-studied genetic biomarker in schizophrenia is the single nucleotide polymorphism in the HLA-DQB1 gene, which is part of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex.

The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. The New England Journal of Medicine reported a case study of a patient whose wife secretly gave him a dose of a product called \"tartaro emetico\" which contained trivalent antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and is sold in Central America as an aversive treatment for alcohol abuse. When admitted to the hospital, and later in the intensive care unit, he experienced severe chest pains, cardiac abnormalities, renal and hepatic toxicity, and nearly died. The Journal reports that \"Two years later, he [the patient] reports complete abstinence from alcohol.\" It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Pharmacokinetics\nThe therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Heart and blood vessels\n\nVIGOR study and publishing controversy\nThe VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of a supra-therapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over a mean duration of 9-months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \"is primarily due to\" this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer's alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \"aspirin not indicated\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups.\" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. (Utilizing the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. NEJM stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks). Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying \"this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies\". The Journal stated that NEJMs \"ambiguous\" language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; \"the New England Journal says it didn't attempt to have these mistakes corrected.\" Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President Edward Scolnick took much of the blame for the suppression of this information. The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety. The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to CV risk. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration. This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen. In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). One FDA analyst estimated that, based upon his mathematical model, Vioxx may have caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market. The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk. The report found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. Litigation\nBy March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. \"Summary minutes for the February 16, 17 and 18, 2005, Joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.\" Grassley questions Merck about communication with the FDA on Vioxx.

The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\". In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon.

Worldwide, approximately 24 million people have dementia; 60% of these cases are due to Alzheimer's. The clinical sign of Alzheimer's is progressive cognition deterioration. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, and affects as many as 5.1 million Americans. In Alzheimer’s disease, a protein fragment called beta-amyloid accumulates at abnormally high levels in the brain. In the the most common type of Alzheimer’s disease, late-onset Alzheimer’s, symptoms usually appear after age 65. The study appears online ahead of print in the American Journal of Epidemiology and may draw a new picture of poor vision as predictor of dementia rather than as a symptom after the diagnosis. “Visual problems can have serious consequences and are very common among the elderly, but many of them are not seeking treatment,” says lead author Mary A.M. Rogers, Ph.D, research assistant professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School and research director of the Patient Safety Enhancement Program at the U-M Health System and the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center. ”Our results indicate that it is important for elderly individuals with visual problems to seek medical attention so that the causes of the problems can be identified and treated,” Rogers says. These include reading, playing board games, other mentally stimulating activities, social networking, as well as physical activity such as walking and routine exercising. According to a survey conducted by the National Eye Health Education Program, less than 11 percent of respondents understood that there are no early warning signs for eye problems such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. The study was based on the surveys and medical information from 625 people compiled from 1992-2005. Approximately 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease and the number has doubled since 1980. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences studied a large database, collected in the US, of patients with Alzheimer’s or memory complaints who had MRI scans and had spinal taps to collect cerebrospinal fluid, which is in the brain and spinal chord. By examining the CFS they could measure the amounts of the substances that make p plaques and tangles, and related this to brain atrophy. These regions are important for memory and are typically active when the brain is at rest. A 20-year study by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center has found that a simple blood test may identify people at risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease. Conversely, a decline of Aß42 in the bloodstream may signal the compartmentalization or “traffic jam” of Aß42 in the brain, which occurs in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. They deduce that Aß42 trapped in the brain could account for the decrease in levels post-dementia. While the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer’s can be monitored throughout the disease course, clinicians have had no reliable way to monitor the pathologic progression of the disease. Earlier detection would of course be an important step in combating the disease, researchers said. A new study finds that a decline in older people’s’ mental abilities starts years before death, even if they do not have dementia. Perceptual speed starts deteriorating some 15 years before death, spatial ability starts failing nearly 8 years before death, and verbal ability about 6.5 years before death. These findings came out of a study using 288 people without dementia, who were monitored from age 70 to death, with an average age at death of 84. Their mental skills were checked up to 12 times over a 30-year period, to ensure they did not have dementia. The study used a sample of 3,660 men and women aged 65 or older and subjected them to brain scans to look for silent brain infarcts, stroke or dementia. The risk of Alzheimer’s disease is nearly doubled among people who have had a stroke, and researchers at Columbia University Medical Center have found a process in the brain that explains the connection. \"This finding connects the dots between p25 and increased production of amyloid beta, and this p25/cdk5 pathway could explain why the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is significantly higher following a stroke,\" said Dr. Duff, professor of pathology (in psychiatry and in the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer’s Disease and the Aging Brain) at Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. In 2014, she was elected van Geest Professor of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge and in 2017 was awarded the Cambridge Centre of UK Dementia Research Institute of which she is the director. They aim to translate this research into new treatments for dementia. Having identified a major pathway that leads to brain cell death in mice, scientists have now found two drugs that block that pathway and prevent neurodegeneration, with minimal side effects in rodents. We could know in 2-3 years whether this approach can slow down disease progression, which would be a very exciting first step in treating these disorders. We now need to find out whether giving the drug to patients at an early stage could help arrest or slow down the disease through its effects on this pathway.” It is known that misfolded proteins build up in the brains of those with neurodegenerative diseases and are a major factor in dementias such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as prion disease. But in a study published in Brain, the researchers revealed how they identified a number of suitable candidates after testing 1,040 compounds from the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, initially in worms, which have a functioning nervous system. Testing on mice with prion disease and a form of familial tauopathy or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) identified two drugs that restored the protein production rate. Misfolded proteins build up in the brain in several neurodegenerative diseases and are a major factor in dementias such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as prion diseases. They then found switching protein production back on with an experimental drug halted neurodegeneration. This revealed a number of suitable candidate compounds that could then be tested in mouse models of prion disease and a form of familial tauopathy (frontotemporal dementia - FTD), both of which had been protected by the experimental - but toxic - compounds in the team's previous studies. Both drugs prevented the emergence of signs of brain cell damage in most of the prion-diseased mice and restored memory in the FTD mice. We could know in 2-3 years whether this approach can slow down disease progression, which would be a very exciting first step in treating these disorders. They show that a treatment approach originally discovered in mice with prion disease might also work to prevent the death of brain cells in some forms of dementia. “The drug blocks a natural defense mechanism in cells which is overactive in the brains of people with frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's, so has the potential to work for several conditions. So far it has only been tested in mice with frontotemporal dementia but Alzheimer's Society is now funding the researchers to test it in models of Alzheimer's too.”\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n1963 births\nLiving people\nPeople educated at Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls\nAlumni of St Hilda's College, Oxford\nAlumni of University College London\nAlumni of Imperial College London\nAcademics of the University of Leicester\nWomen medical researchers\nBritish medical researchers\nBritish neuroscientists\nBritish women neuroscientists\nFellows of Churchill College, Cambridge\nFellows of the Royal College of Physicians\n\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) ; Clinical Dementia Rating ; Dementia Rating Scale Dementia testing is often done by way of testing the cognitive functions that are most often impaired by the disease e.g. Tests such as these are by no means conclusive of deficits, but may give a good indication as to the presence or severity of dementia. Reduced volume, or atrophy, in parts of the brain known as the amygdala and hippocampus may predict which cognitively healthy elderly people will develop dementia over a six-year period, according to a study in the January issue of Archives of General Psychiatry, one of the JAMA/Archives journals. New strategies may be able to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia among older adults, according to background information in the article. Accurate methods of identifying which people are at high risk for dementia in old age would help physicians determine who could benefit from these interventions. However, previous research has not addressed whether measuring atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict the onset of AD at an earlier stage, before cognitive symptoms appear. Tom den Heijer, M.D., Ph.D., of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues used MRI to assess the brain volumes of 511 dementia-free elderly people who were part of the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based cohort study that began in 1990. They screened the participants for dementia at initial visits in 1995 and 1996 and then in follow-up visits between 1997 and 2003, during which they asked about memory problems and performed extensive neuropsychological testing. The authors also monitored the medical records of all participants. During the follow-up, 35 participants developed dementia and 26 were diagnosed with AD. People with severe amygdalar or hippocampal atrophy had the highest risk of developing dementia or AD over the course of the study, which followed participants for an average period of six years. \"Concerning the extent of atrophy, we found in those destined to develop dementia volume reductions between 17 percent and 5 percent, depending on how long before the diagnosis of dementia the MRI was conducted,\" the authors report. \"In persons with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, volume reductions compared with healthy elderly persons are between 25 percent and 40 percent, suggesting that atrophy rates accelerate in patients with Alzheimer disease.\" \"However, we must bear in mind that most people with atrophy did not develop dementia, even after six years. Further prospective population studies are therefore required to find additional biomarkers, including other brain imaging parameters, that alone or in combination with clinical and genetic characteristics can help separate those who are at risk for developing dementia from those who are not.\" \"Reduced Brain Volume May Predict Dementia In Healthy Elderly People.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Prior to her death she had indicated that she would not like to be kept artificially alive if brain dead. The fetus had suffered from oxygen deprivation and was suspected to be non-viable. The fetus' lower extremities were deformed to the extent that the gender couldn't be \n\nA Baptist seminary leader joined a special panel at Loyola University New Orleans to discuss end-of-life cases that have sparked national debate. The group covered the cases of Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl placed on a ventilator following complications from tonsil and nasal surgery, and Marlise Munoz, a young mother declared brain dead but kept on life support for two months for the sake of her 14-week-old fetus. Popik cited a study by the American Academy of Neurology that indicated, while the protocol for declaring brain death varies widely from state to state and hospital to hospital, an average hospital determines brain death as many as 50 times a year. Brain death is the total and irreversible cessation of the entire brain, including the brain stem, and is determined by a complete examination using a set of diagnostic criteria and not by a single test, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG), White explained. “The science of brain death is very good. Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on Dec. 12, 2013, after three neurologists confirmed she was unable to breathe on her own, had no blood flow to her brain, and showed no sign of electrical activity in the brain. When McMath’s family refused to remove the ventilator, a legal agreement was eventually forced requiring that a death certificate be issued by the Alameda County, Calif., coroner’s office before the patient was moved to an undisclosed facility where life support continues. White said families sometimes have trouble accepting a doctor’s verdict because a patient on life support has a heartbeat, breathes and feels warm to the touch. Wilde added that the issue is compounded in today’s society because death is often not discussed. Lemke agreed, saying families used to care for patients in their final days at home and watched their loved ones struggle for longer periods of time. “We’re isolated and insulated from the reality of death, so when death comes it is all-the-more shocking and we are all-the-more ill-prepared for it,” Lemke said. A judge ruled in his favor on Jan. 24, 2014, stating that the fetus was abnormal and not viable, and that women had a right to end pregnancies if they wished. While the law seeks to balance the rights of individuals, Popik argued the mother’s rights were extinguished when she was pronounced brain dead. According to a Jan. 28, 2014 NPR article reporting on the case, the authors of the bill “intended to keep a pregnant woman who was in a persistent vegetative state on a ventilator until she could deliver, but not a dead pregnant woman,” and insisted the hospital had misinterpreted the law. While the Munoz case was in the news earlier this year, a similar story previously unfolded in Canada. Robyn Benson of British Columbia was declared brain dead at 22 weeks into her pregnancy. Life support continued and her healthy but premature son was delivered at 27 weeks. Benson died the next day. Analysts of the Munoz and Benson cases point out that the hospital had declared the Munoz fetus not viable, while the Benson fetus was determined to be normal. Allowing organ donation is a separate issue but should be expressed in an advanced directive. China, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy. Courts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the Baby K case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved). Maternal somatic support after brain death occurs when a brain dead patient is pregnant and their body is kept alive to deliver a fetus. Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990–96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age. Past cases \n\nIn the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were \"30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series).\" In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother \"since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature.\" Life support complications \n\nThroughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including \"infection, hemodynamic instability, diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilothermia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\" However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Brain death vs. similar conditions \n\nIt is important to understand the similarities and differences between brain death and two other conditions: persistent vegetative state and coma. Difference between brain death and persistent vegetative state \n\nPatients in a persistent vegetative state \"are alive but also have severely impaired consciousness, although their eyes may open spontaneously. These patients do not acknowledge the examiner; they do not attend or track objects that are presented to them; their movements are non-purposeful; they do not speak.\" The difference between the two states is that brain death means \"death of the brainstem\" which can be clinically diagnosed and vegetative state means \"permanent and total loss of forebrain function\" which needs further investigation. Difference between brain death and coma \n\nPeople in comas have \"presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses.\" However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state. U.S.A. Federal and state laws \n\nSeveral laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death. This recent situation involving Marlise Muñoz raised a host of questions related to unborn fetuses, patient and family preferences, and hospital discretion in interpreting state laws that involve advance directives. Cost of care \n\nThe cost of maintaining a brain dead mother on life support depends on the number of days spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain dead mothers on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days). The most recent peer-reviewed investigation to note the overall cost of care for a viable child delivered from a somatically supported brain dead mother focused on the case of a child delivered via cesarean section in California on the 63rd hospital day at 31 weeks gestation, to a mother who was brain dead at 22 weeks gestation in 1983. The death of Marlise Muñoz at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, TX was the most recently publicized instance of somatic support of a brain dead pregnant woman from 2013-2014. and Loewy  propose the following rubric when determining whether or not to offer life support to a pregnant, brain dead woman:\n If the fetus suffers from the event as the mother suffers, life support should not be provided. For example, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health has published Brain Death and Pregnancy, a report to help clinicians, healthcare administrators, and families evaluate the ethical considerations surrounding women's health. When a pregnant woman becomes brain dead, the mother can no longer acknowledge the fetus; as such, the mother no longer has a moral responsibility for keeping the fetus alive. They argue that because the brain dead patient is no longer alive, he or she ceases to be a patient; the continuation of ventilation in an effort to save the fetus can be considered a medical experiment that requires ethics committee or IRB-approval before a facility can perform this work. Public opinion and activism \n\nKeeping a medically declared 'brain dead' woman on life support to sustain a potentially viable fetus is a topic of considerable debate and controversy. There is heavy discourse between biomedical and legal experts regarding whether a dead person is \"a dysfunctional incubator\" to an unborn fetus. Supporters against life-sustaining efforts, when it conflicts with a woman's wishes, include pro-choice groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America. Supporters in favor of life-sustaining efforts include anti-abortion advocacy groups (e.g. Notable cases \n\nOn 26 August 2019 in Brno (Czech Republic) a newborn was delivered in 34th week of pregnancy to a mother declared brain-dead after a stroke.

The first case in Turkey was recorded on 11 March, when a local returned home from a trip to Europe. Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally. However, according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics. On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. Timeline\n\nJanuary 2020 \n\nOn 10 January 2020, ignoring China's insistence on the lack of evidence for human-to-human transmission, Ministry of Health experts stated that they suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among people, and accordingly set up the Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board. February 2020 \n\nOn 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated Iran for its duplicity and laxity and unilaterally closed its border on 23 February. On 29 February, Turkey announced the termination of all flights to and from Italy, South Korea and Iraq. March 2020: First confirmed case, closures, and cancellations \n\nTurkish cities carried out massive disinfection work in public places and mass transit vehicles. The next day, Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Minister Koca updated the number of infected people as four on 13 March, including a pilgrim who had returned from Saudi Arabia. Following the updated tally, Turkey extended the flight ban to also include many European countries, including Austria, France, and Germany. With that announcement, more than 80 million people in Turkey started to live under some form of restrictions to their movements when trains and public transit came to a halt nationwide. At the same time, Turkey started to open drive-through screening clinics, based on the South Korean-pioneered model, which allows the provision of tests at no cost, while avoiding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 21 March, the Minister of the Interior Soylu announced a total curfew, effective midnight on 22 March, for those who are over the age of 65 or persons whose immune system is compromised due to \"chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and liver disease.\" April 2020: Restrictions continue \n\nOn 2 April, Istanbul Medical Chamber expressed concern about Ministry of Health's tally, which included only the cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, thereby excluding the ELISAs administered in private hospitals. In a televised address on the same day, President Erdoğan announced the measures that prohibit entries into and exit from Turkey's largest cities, including the commercial hub Istanbul for 15 days. On 13 April, President Erdoğan announced that curfews on weekends would continue but the restrictions were less stringent during the week, and many non-essential businesses, including construction sites remained open. On 23 April, Turkey became the seventh country to report more than 100,000 coronavirus cases. Explaining that the return to normal life will happen gradually, Ministry of Health stated that Turkey has an opportunity to create and upgrade to permanently pandemic-resistant cities by subsidizing businesses to make ventilation upgrades to limit spread of viruses, tackling poor indoor air quality, which has long been a source of disease. On 7 May, the government acknowledged that the social-distancing measures, including the closure of offices and schools, ban on mass gatherings were rolled out without knowing which measures would work. Ministry of Health stated that by relaxing restrictions gradually, it will be able to make more informed recommendations on social-distancing measures in the future. On 2 June, the Turkish Parliament resumed full activities for the first time in 48 days since a hiatus was declared due to the pandemic. July 2020: Turkey opens for tourism \n\nIn July, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged a rewrite of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board guidelines to discourage reporting asymptomatic people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. On 30 August, mayors of Istanbul and Ankara Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş said that there was a mismatch between the statistics reported by Ministry of Health and the local data, and accused the national government of covering up the coronavirus resurgence. On 2 October, Minister of Internal Affairs, following an advisory opinion of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board, instructed all provinces to prohibit holding large public meetings until 1 December 2020. December 2020: Rising death roll and assessment of coronavirus vaccines \n\nOn 6 December, Ministry of Health Fahrettin Koca announced that 50 million doses of CoronaVac should arrive by the end of February 2021, and 10 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should start arriving still during December. Earlier in the spring of 2020, during the first COVID-19 surge in the Turkey, the rising death toll reached a peak on 22 April, with a seven-day average of 122 daily deaths. In December, the seven-day average of deaths in Turkey from COVID-19 broke that record, at 255 on 29 December. On 14 January 2021, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received the COVID-19 vaccine. March 2021 \nAt the beginning of March, the Turkish government eased the restrictions, but the rates of infections rose to 21030. Turkey has witnessed a very bad season of tourism due to the restrictions of the pandemic but bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen at half-capacity in provinces with lower infection rates. On 30 March, Turkey said that it will reimpose lockdowns during weekends and restrictions during Ramadan, and that is after confirming 37,303 new cases. February 2022 \nOn February 5, 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his wife, Emine, have tested positive for COVID-19. Erdogan announced that they had been infected with the Omicron coronavirus and were experiencing mild symptoms. Government response\n\nChild welfare and education\n\nOn 12 March 2020, the Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Economy \nThroughout the pandemic, despite additional headwinds such as Saudi bans on Turkish goods, Turkish economy has performed far better than that of many of the country's peers. Turkey provided a boost to the economy in a series of historically large economic packages. International aid \n\nDuring the pandemic, Turkey has provided funds, doctors, dispatched medical equipment such as PPE, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing kits, and other assistance to at least 55 countries.

On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. Timeline\n\nJanuary 2020 \n\nOn 10 January 2020, ignoring China's insistence on the lack of evidence for human-to-human transmission, Ministry of Health experts stated that they suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among people, and accordingly set up the Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board. February 2020 \n\nOn 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated Iran for its duplicity and laxity and unilaterally closed its border on 23 February. On 29 February, Turkey announced the termination of all flights to and from Italy, South Korea and Iraq. March 2020: First confirmed case, closures, and cancellations \n\nTurkish cities carried out massive disinfection work in public places and mass transit vehicles. The next day, Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Minister Koca updated the number of infected people as four on 13 March, including a pilgrim who had returned from Saudi Arabia. Following the updated tally, Turkey extended the flight ban to also include many European countries, including Austria, France, and Germany. With that announcement, more than 80 million people in Turkey started to live under some form of restrictions to their movements when trains and public transit came to a halt nationwide. At the same time, Turkey started to open drive-through screening clinics, based on the South Korean-pioneered model, which allows the provision of tests at no cost, while avoiding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 21 March, the Minister of the Interior Soylu announced a total curfew, effective midnight on 22 March, for those who are over the age of 65 or persons whose immune system is compromised due to \"chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and liver disease.\" April 2020: Restrictions continue \n\nOn 2 April, Istanbul Medical Chamber expressed concern about Ministry of Health's tally, which included only the cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, thereby excluding the ELISAs administered in private hospitals. In a televised address on the same day, President Erdoğan announced the measures that prohibit entries into and exit from Turkey's largest cities, including the commercial hub Istanbul for 15 days. On 13 April, President Erdoğan announced that curfews on weekends would continue but the restrictions were less stringent during the week, and many non-essential businesses, including construction sites remained open. On 23 April, Turkey became the seventh country to report more than 100,000 coronavirus cases. Explaining that the return to normal life will happen gradually, Ministry of Health stated that Turkey has an opportunity to create and upgrade to permanently pandemic-resistant cities by subsidizing businesses to make ventilation upgrades to limit spread of viruses, tackling poor indoor air quality, which has long been a source of disease. On 7 May, the government acknowledged that the social-distancing measures, including the closure of offices and schools, ban on mass gatherings were rolled out without knowing which measures would work. Ministry of Health stated that by relaxing restrictions gradually, it will be able to make more informed recommendations on social-distancing measures in the future. On 2 June, the Turkish Parliament resumed full activities for the first time in 48 days since a hiatus was declared due to the pandemic. July 2020: Turkey opens for tourism \n\nIn July, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged a rewrite of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board guidelines to discourage reporting asymptomatic people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. On 30 August, mayors of Istanbul and Ankara Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş said that there was a mismatch between the statistics reported by Ministry of Health and the local data, and accused the national government of covering up the coronavirus resurgence. On 2 October, Minister of Internal Affairs, following an advisory opinion of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board, instructed all provinces to prohibit holding large public meetings until 1 December 2020. December 2020: Rising death roll and assessment of coronavirus vaccines \n\nOn 6 December, Ministry of Health Fahrettin Koca announced that 50 million doses of CoronaVac should arrive by the end of February 2021, and 10 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should start arriving still during December. Earlier in the spring of 2020, during the first COVID-19 surge in the Turkey, the rising death toll reached a peak on 22 April, with a seven-day average of 122 daily deaths. In December, the seven-day average of deaths in Turkey from COVID-19 broke that record, at 255 on 29 December. On 14 January 2021, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received the COVID-19 vaccine. March 2021 \nAt the beginning of March, the Turkish government eased the restrictions, but the rates of infections rose to 21030. Turkey has witnessed a very bad season of tourism due to the restrictions of the pandemic but bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen at half-capacity in provinces with lower infection rates. On 30 March, Turkey said that it will reimpose lockdowns during weekends and restrictions during Ramadan, and that is after confirming 37,303 new cases. February 2022 \nOn February 5, 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his wife, Emine, have tested positive for COVID-19. Erdogan announced that they had been infected with the Omicron coronavirus and were experiencing mild symptoms. Government response\n\nChild welfare and education\n\nOn 12 March 2020, the Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Economy \nThroughout the pandemic, despite additional headwinds such as Saudi bans on Turkish goods, Turkish economy has performed far better than that of many of the country's peers. Turkey provided a boost to the economy in a series of historically large economic packages. International aid \n\nDuring the pandemic, Turkey has provided funds, doctors, dispatched medical equipment such as PPE, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing kits, and other assistance to at least 55 countries. By setting itself up as a provider rather than a recipient of aid, Turkey portrayed itself as a valuable partner in combating the global spread of SARS-CoV-2. The first case in Turkey was recorded on 11 March, when a local returned home from a trip to Europe. Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally.

New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Vaccinating children may protect those around them. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend yearly vaccination for nearly all people over the age of six months, especially those at high risk. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high risk groups. The vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with  egg allergies. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms. Depending on the type they can be injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin (intradermal). The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons. History\n\nVaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Origins and development\nIn the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, \"Pharmacists tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and serums (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzaea name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agentand several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.\" The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as four hundred excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, demonstrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result can be cited to support lingering doubts about vaccination as well as to counter ungrounded claims about the safety of vaccination. In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976. Quadrivalent vaccines for seasonal flu\n\nA quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the FDA in March 2012. In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent. Medical uses\nThe U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The influenza vaccine also appears to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15 to 45%. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise. Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offer consistent year-on-year protection against influenza. There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. Research demonstrates patients infected with the two viruses are over twice as likely to die as patients with only COVID-19. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely receive an influenza vaccine. An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant. In children, the vaccine appears to decrease the risk of influenza and possibly influenza-like illness. In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of influenza vaccination in healthy 5–18-year-olds, and in 2015, published a review of the use of pediatric Fluad in children 6–72 months of age. In one study, conducted in a tertiary referral center, the rate of influenza vaccination in children was only 31%. Higher rates were found among immuno-suppressed pediatric patients (46%), and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (50%). Adults\n\nIn unvaccinated adults, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu, while about 10% of vaccinated adults do. Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%. In working adults, a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications. In healthy working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths. The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age. There is a high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine. It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant. Vaccinating health care workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population. While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit. Pregnancy\nAs well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy. The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV. In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic. Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to one in ten thousand) and the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately ten times higher by 2009 estimates). Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations, a large study in China, covering close to a hundred million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 \"swine\" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects. Studies examining the safety of influenza vaccines in people with severe egg allergies found that anaphylaxis was very rare, occurring in 1.3 cases per million doses given. Monitoring for symptoms from vaccination is recommended in those with more severe symptoms. A study of nearly 800 children with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine. Other\nSeveral studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine; efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger. Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative. Types\n\nFlu vaccines are available either as:\n a trivalent or quadrivalent intramuscular injection (IIV3, IIV4, or RIV4, that is, TIV or QIV), which contains the inactivated form of the virus\n a nasal spray of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV, Q/LAIV), which contains the live but attenuated (weakened) form of the virus. TIV or QIV induce protection after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective) based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages. Recommendations\nVarious public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend that yearly influenza vaccination be routinely offered, particularly to people at risk of complications of influenza and those individuals who live with or care for high-risk individuals, including:\n people aged 50 years of age or older\n people with chronic lung diseases, including asthma\n people with chronic heart diseases\n people with chronic liver diseases\n people with chronic kidney diseases\n people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen is not working properly\n people who are immunocompromised\n residents of nursing homes and other long-term—care facilities\n health care workers (both to prevent sickness and to prevent spread to their patients)\n \n children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection\n American Indians/Alaska Natives\n people who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults)\n\nThe flu vaccine is contraindicated for those under six months of age and those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. Particularly:\n People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, including the morbidly obese, healthy pregnant women, children 6–59 months, the elderly, aboriginals, and people suffering from one of an itemized list of chronic health conditions\n People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk, including household contacts and health care workers\n People who provide essential community services\n Certain poultry workers\n\nLive attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was not available in Canada for the 2019–2020 season. European Union\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends vaccinating the elderly as a priority, with a secondary priority people with chronic medical conditions and health care workers. The influenza vaccination strategy is generally that of protecting vulnerable people, rather than limiting influenza circulation or totally eliminating human influenza sickness. This is in contrast with the high herd immunity strategies for other infectious diseases such as polio and measles. United States\n\nIn the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged six months and over. According to the CDC, the live attenuated virus (LAIV4) (which comes in the form of the nasal spray in the US) should be avoided by some groups. The US government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. The CDC indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, was not recommended for the 2016–2017 flu season in the United States. She urged eligible people to get COVID-19 and flu vaccines. She maintains flu vaccination is important every year. People need to know that flu can be fatal as many people do not know this. Australia uses inactivated vaccines. Uptake\n\nAt risk groups\nUptake of flu vaccination, both seasonally and during pandemics, is often low. Beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are also important. Health care workers\nFrontline health care workers are often recommended to get seasonal and any pandemic flu vaccination. The main reason to vaccinate health care workers is to prevent staff from spreading flu to their patients and to reduce staff absence at a time of high service demand, but the reasons health care workers state for their decisions to accept or decline vaccination may more often be to do with perceived personal benefits. One of the reasons for rejecting vaccines was concern over adverse reactions; in one study, 31% of resident physicians at a teaching hospital incorrectly believed Australian vaccines could cause influenza. Manufacturing\n\nResearch continues into the idea of a \"universal\" influenza vaccine that would not require tailoring to a particular strain, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses. Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs are inoculated separately. , both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs. Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are eleven or twelve days old. At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers. Done on a large-scale, this method is used to produce the flu vaccine for the human population. A gene-based DNA vaccine, used to prime the immune system after boosting with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine, underwent clinical trials in 2011. The applicant for this medicinal product is Sanofi Pasteur. Because of the way it is produced, it produces better-matched vaccine (to the flu strains). Cost-effectiveness\nThe cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings. In the elderly (over 65), the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination. In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations. The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden, as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine. In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings. Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including prepandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies and diagnostic tools. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences that will help researchers' understanding of what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves over time. Solutions to limitations in current vaccine methods are being researched. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Microsoft's Bing search engine, and proposed a statistical framework which, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the influenza-like illness reduction percentage in areas where vaccinations have been performed. The method has been used to quantify the impact of two flu vaccination programmes in England (2013/14 and 2014/15), where school-age children were administered a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Notably, the impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England based on traditional syndromic surveillance endpoints. , more than seventy known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines. In September 2009, the FDA approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month. Audenz is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Audenz is approved for use in persons six months of age and older at increased risk of exposure to the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades. Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have experimented with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than one microgram. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has issued recommendations on the prevention and control of avian influenza in poultry, including the use of vaccination. A filtered and purified Influenza A vaccine for humans is being developed and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled so if an Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Most swine flu vaccines include an H1N1 and an H3N2 strain. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Customised (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated, are made and used in the more difficult cases. The vaccine manufacturer Novartis claims that the H3N2 strain (first identified in 1998) has brought major losses to pig farmers. However, a vaccine was found in 2004. The World Health Organization (WHO) coordinates the contents of the vaccine each year to contain the most likely strains of the virus to attack the next year. A February 2018 CDC interim report estimated the vaccine effectiveness to be 25% against H3N2, 67% against H1N1, and 42% against influenza B. United States\nThe Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that the quadrivalent formulation of egg-based influenza vaccines for the US 2020–2021 influenza season contain the following:\n\n an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/HongKong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus (B/Victoria lineage);\n a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata lineage). Cell-based trivalent vaccines should contain:\n an A/Hawaii/70/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. Cell-based trivalent vaccines should contain:\n an A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;\n an A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus;\n a B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. The Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis and the Icahn School of Medicine in Mount Sinai in New York are using the glycoprotein neuraminidase as a targeted antigen in their research. Three monoclonal antibodies (mAB) were sampled from a patient infected with influenza A H3N2 virus. High-risk populations, including the elderly and those with chronic disease, often acquire only limited immunity towards the flu from vaccines. The vaccines have been found to be 30% to 70% effective in preventing hospitalization from the flu or pneumonia. Influenza vaccines, also known as flu jabs or flu shots, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses. New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Vaccinating children may protect those around them. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend yearly vaccination for nearly all people over the age of six months, especially those at high risk. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high risk groups. The vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with  egg allergies. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms. Depending on the type they can be injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin (intradermal). The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons. History\n\nVaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Origins and development\nIn the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, \"Pharmacists tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and serums (chiefly against what we now call Hemophilus influenzaea name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agentand several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.\" The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as four hundred excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, demonstrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result can be cited to support lingering doubts about vaccination as well as to counter ungrounded claims about the safety of vaccination. In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976. Quadrivalent vaccines for seasonal flu\n\nA quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the FDA in March 2012. In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent. Medical uses\nThe U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The influenza vaccine also appears to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15 to 45%. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise. Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offer consistent year-on-year protection against influenza. There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. Research demonstrates patients infected with the two viruses are over twice as likely to die as patients with only COVID-19. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely receive an influenza vaccine. An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant. In children, the vaccine appears to decrease the risk of influenza and possibly influenza-like illness. In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of influenza vaccination in healthy 5–18-year-olds, and in 2015, published a review of the use of pediatric Fluad in children 6–72 months of age. In one study, conducted in a tertiary referral center, the rate of influenza vaccination in children was only 31%. Higher rates were found among immuno-suppressed pediatric patients (46%), and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (50%). Adults\n\nIn unvaccinated adults, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu, while about 10% of vaccinated adults do. Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%. In working adults, a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications. In healthy working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of health care worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths. The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age. There is a high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine. It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant. Vaccinating health care workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population. While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit. Pregnancy\nAs well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy. The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV. In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic. Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to one in ten thousand) and the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately ten times higher by 2009 estimates). Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations, a large study in China, covering close to a hundred million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 \"swine\" flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects. Studies examining the safety of influenza vaccines in people with severe egg allergies found that anaphylaxis was very rare, occurring in 1.3 cases per million doses given. Monitoring for symptoms from vaccination is recommended in those with more severe symptoms. A study of nearly 800 children with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine. Other\nSeveral studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine; efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the ASO3-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger. Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative.

A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched. In 1998, The Zoonotic Importance of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Transmission From Human to Monkey was noticed. Of the panel of human viruses studied, measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 were found in some of the studied animals. In 2006, scientists noticed HPT of measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in the case of performing monkeys, who are \"a common phenomena in Asia\". In 2018, scientists speculated that HPT was likely to have occurred in the case of human malaria parasites. Also in 2018, scientists speculated that an outbreak of tuberculosis among a closed breeding colony of Aotus monkeys was likely due to continuing intermittent HPT exposure. Alternatively, efficient person-to-person spread could occur if the H5N1 virus evolves and adapts to more efficient replication and transmissibility in the human population.\" H5N1 may cause \n\n Infection in humans and horses are different.

To help reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in nursing homes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Safety Program for Long-term Care: HAIs/CAUTI aimed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), enhance frontline healthcare professional knowledge about infection prevention, and improve the safety culture in nursing homes. The questionnaire included 30 items about infection prevention, with a specific focus on CAUTI prevention. Most VA nursing home infection prevention programs were integrated within their VA acute care infection prevention programs, and they had more infection prevention related resources. Overall, a lower percentage of VA nursing homes reported having policies concerning appropriate catheter use or catheter insertion compared to non-VA nursing homes. For example, only 64% of VA nursing homes had policies specifying the appropriate indications for catheter use compared with 81% of non-VA nursing homes. Mody L, Greene M, Saint S, et al., and Krein S. Comparing Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection Prevention Programs between VA and Non-VA Nursing Homes. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. urinary tract infections from catheters, pressure ulcer, and sepsis from catheters. The culprit, according to a study published in the American Journal of Infection Control, is nurse burnout and has been linked to higher rates of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). These problems affect nurses both personally and professionally, and it may affect their patients as well. It then compared a hospital’s percentage of burnout nurses to its rates of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs). It seems rather clear-cut that, from time constraints alone, fewer caregivers would translate into a lower standard of care. Because Medicare and some private insurers are no longer reimbursing for CAUTIs and SSIs, it only makes sense that hospitals would do everything possible to eliminate these adverse events. Dr. Wagner points out that just complaining about poor staffing does nothing to alleviate the situation and that the evidence needs to be presented by well-educated nurses in formal proposals to administrators. Dr. Wagner reminds nurses that there are simple steps they can take to help reduce the incidence of HAIs. Other preventive measures bring a nurse’s role as patient advocate into play. Dr. Wagner recommends that nurses conduct daily reviews of all their patients who have catheters and advocate for the removal of those that are no longer necessary. This is just one way a nurse can identify a problem simply by implementing a daily practice, which increases the quality of patient care and deliver the most cost-effective nursing care possible. Dr. Wagner encourages nurses to check online resources that recommend nursing interventions for preventing common types of HAIs. The CDC’s latest recommendations are compiled in the 2009 Guideline for Prevention of CAUTIs and in the Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999. The exact numbers of individuals with acute prostatitis is unknown, because many do not seek treatment. In the US, at least 1-3 percent of males under the age of 40 develop urinary difficulty as a result of acute prostatitis. Most physicians and other health care professionals are aware of these disorders. Worldwide, both BPH and acute prostatitis have \n\n Acute urinary retention is treated by placement of a urinary catheter (small thin flexible tube) into the bladder. This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place. Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional or by the person themselves (clean intermittent self catheterization). Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique. Patients can be taught to use a self catheterization technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters. Self catheterization requires doing the procedure periodically during the day, the frequency depending on fluid intake\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Firstly, the familiarity of the barbershop setting within the participants' community can help foster a sense of comfort and trust. In the study mentioned, barbers were trained to measure blood pressure and provide counseling on hypertension. As trusted advisors within the community, barbers played a crucial role in engaging participants and facilitating discussions on healthcare. This approach allowed for easy access to blood pressure screenings and immediate referrals to healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists who were available in the barbershop. The convenience of having healthcare services provided within the barbershop itself eliminates the need for participants to travel to another location for assistance. Moreover, the study highlighted that the interventions in the barbershop setting were associated with increased patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Participants in the intervention group, who received screenings and pharmacist consultations in the barbershop, were more receptive to lifestyle modification recommendations. Overall, conducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop setting offers advantages such as enhanced patient engagement, improved accessibility, and increased compliance. The purpose of the $8.5 million grant awarded to the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute physician is to support a new, randomized, controlled clinical trial aimed at enlisting African-American barbers in the fight against hypertension. The physician, Ronald G. Victor, MD, conducted a previous study that showed offering blood pressure checks during men's haircuts and encouraging patrons with hypertension to follow up with physicians could save hundreds of lives annually. Now, with the grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Dr. Victor will conduct a new trial with 500 African-American male patrons of 20 Los Angeles-area barbershops. The goal of this trial is to test the effectiveness of barbershop hypertension programs and evaluate whether expanding such programs is feasible and cost-effective. Los Angeles, CA (BlackNews.com) — Visiting a barbershop in California this Saturday could mean more than getting a haircut. It might be a lifesaver. The Black Barbershop Health Outreach Program, a unique, grassroots approach to health screening and education, will be held at more than 80 barbershops in 23 cities statewide on Saturday, May 22 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. In hundreds of nearby barbershops, African American men nationwide will receive free screening for diabetes and hypertension, and learn why early detection of prostate cancer can be a life-saving decision. Led by Dr. Bill J. Releford, D.P.M., founder of The Diabetic Amputation Prevention (DAP) Foundation, along with a squadron of volunteers, the outreach program seeks to empower African American men to better understand cardiovascular diseases through education, testing and prevention. Through black-owned barbershops, which represent a cultural institution of familiarity and trust, the outreach program has adopted a novel means to spread health information.

Watching motivational videos on how to keep your blood pressure in check could considerably improve your cardiovascular health. Dubbed the silent killer due to its asymptomatic nature, high blood pressure damages blood vessels over time. Luckily, there are several things that a person can do to lower their blood pressure. How does e-counseling affect hypertension? Nolan and his team explain that using the Internet in search of health tips is \"the third most popular online activity,\" with 72 percent of users engaging in it. New research shows that this dairy product, rich in probiotic properties, lowers blood pressure in rodents. The other group only received generic emails with information about blood pressure management. \"It's automated, but it's also interactive,\" he goes on, also stressing the importance of actively engaging the patients to improve their health. \"The interactive tools help people self-assess their changes in blood pressure or lifestyle behavior, which is very important. In fact, our current healthcare system and reimbursement protocols frame it as such. However, a recent study on high blood pressure took place in a barbershop, and researchers wanted to learn more about patient compliance to medical recommendations and medications. Why Study High Blood Pressure in a Barbershop? Researchers chose to conduct a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop because it was a familiar setting within the participants’ community. They also trained barbers, who were considered as trusted advisors, to measure blood pressure and council participants on hypertension. Participants in the intervention group were screened for high blood pressure by their barber and then referred to meet with a pharmacist who was in the barbershop. The pharmacist provided medication and education for lifestyle modifications. The control group received education from their barber on lifestyle modifications. Researchers concluded that the location of this study and its convenience impacted patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Additionally, the intervention group did not have to go to another location to receive help from the pharmacists, as they were immediately available in the barbershop. While not a physician, the barber was viewed by all participants as a reliable member of the community. Therefore, the experiment suggests that patients must trust the individual delivering healthcare recommendations. The barbershop study demonstrates that to improve care on a larger scale, fewer restrictions should be placed on the type of qualified provider and setting of treatment.

It said that if children with low levels of cortisol are exposed to trauma such as sexual abuse, they are six times more likely to develop the condition when older. Contrary to the impression that might be gained from parts of the news report, this study did not assess cortisol levels in childhood, but only in adults with or without CFS. The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Archives of General Psychiatry . The researchers wanted to investigate this by looking at levels of the hormone cortisol in people with and without CFS. Cortisol is involved in the body’s stress response. Of these people, 124 were confirmed as healthy, and acted as controls. The participants’ cortisol levels were measured using samples of their saliva taken immediately upon waking in the morning, and 30, 45, and 60 minutes later. The researchers then compared levels of childhood trauma between the cases and controls. The researchers also looked at the relationship between cortisol levels, childhood trauma and CFS. If the participants were split into those with and without trauma, only those with CFS and childhood trauma had reduced cortisol levels. The researchers conclude that their results “confirm childhood trauma as an important risk factor of CFS”. This may indicate the biological mechanism behind how childhood trauma could affect risk of CFS. They say that their findings “are critical to inform pathophysiological research and to devise targets for the prevention of CFS”. This study only measured cortisol levels in adults who were already known to have or not have CFS. Therefore it cannot indicate whether cortisol levels in childhood owuld be able to predict risk of CFS in later life. Much more research is needed to fully understand the causes of this complex condition. Foster children have elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in comparison to children raised by their biological parents. Elevated cortisol levels can compromise the immune system. Negative environmental influences during this critical period of brain development can have lifelong consequences. The women were exposed to each condition on different days. Those who had high chronic stress levels and a low cortisol reactivity to the acute stress task consumed significantly more calories from chocolate cake than women with low chronic stress levels after both control and stress conditions. High cortisol levels, in combination with high insulin levels, may be responsible for stress-induced eating, as research shows high cortisol reactivity is associated with hyperphagia, \n\n Towards a Psychosis Risk Blood Diagnostic for Persons Experiencing High-Risk Symptoms: In this study, the researchers looked at different analytes found in human blood plasma. These plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism. It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis. Early warning British brain scientists have identified a 'biological signpost' for clinical depression and say it could help identify those are at risk of developing the debilitating mental illness. In a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, the team found that teenage boys who have a combination of depressive symptoms and raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol are up to 14 times more likely to develop major depression than those who show neither trait. The findings suggest teenagers could in future be screened for such signals, and those at highest risk could be helped to develop the kind of coping strategies and \"brain fitness\" to help them avoid becoming depressive. \"(And) we now have a very real way of identifying those teenage boys most likely to develop clinical depression.\" For their study, Goodyear's team measured levels of cortisol in saliva from two large separate groups of teenagers. The first group of 660 provided samples on four school mornings within a week and then again 12 months later. A second group of 1198 teenagers gave samples over three school mornings.

A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were warned by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" for likening it to SARS.

Mao Qun'an, spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said on Wednesday that China faces a \"substantially increased risk\" of more imported cases. Mao made his remarks at a news conference as the condition of China's first confirmed MERS patient, who is from South Korea, was reported to be in stable condition at a hospital in Guangdong province. Inspections of disease control and treatment work will be performed at high risk regions like south Guangdong province and the capital of Beijing,\" he said. MERS is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, similar to SARS. Also on Wednesday, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine ordered border quarantine staff to refer suspected cases to designated hospitals for further investigation. Chinese who are heading to affected areas should avoid visiting local hospitals and having contact with bats and single-hump camels. A Chinese woman living in South Korea has tested positive for MERS, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Wednesday. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert in Guangdong, said a massive outbreak of MERS in China is unlikely given a lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus. Although the post was soon deleted, China CDC came under the spotlight. China CDC had to respond on the next day that the research was a retrospective analysis of the 425 cases reported to CDC on 23 January.

The first-of-its-kind therapy treats cancer by altering a patient's own cells to fight cancer. If you have questions or think you might be a candidate, please discuss with your physician. Over the past several years, cancer researchers have discovered the impact that the immune system can have on treating and preventing cancer. In particular, researchers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center have identified the effect of T cells, which are responsible for the identification and destruction of abnormal substances, like cancer. This treatment allows for the body’s immune system to be super charged with large quantities of CAR T cells which will seek out and attack cancer cells. Who can benefit from this new treatment? If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with ALL, speak with the treating oncologist about all options for treatment. Will this work for my type of cancer? For additional information on current clinical trials available at the Abramson Cancer Center please click here. This treatment has been approved by the FDA and may be covered or reimbursed by your insurance. What are questions I should ask my or my child’s oncologist? How is the treatment given and what is the procedure like? What are the chances of remission or cure? As researchers have learned more about what makes cancer cells different from normal cells, they have developed mAbs to exploit these differences. Newer forms of mAbs are less likely to cause immune reactions. One part attaches to a cancer cell, while the other attaches to an immune cell, bringing the two together and leading to an immune response. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. Cancer cells sometimes take advantage of these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. Researchers have also found promising early results against a number of other cancer types. Only a handful of these treatments have been approved for use so far, but many others are now being studied in clinical trials. In melanoma, this combined approach has been shown to work better than using either treatment alone, but the combination also comes with an increased risk of serious side effects. As researchers have learned over the years, the immune system is very complex. It has also become clear that cancer cells have different ways of eluding the immune system, which makes creating effective vaccines difficult. The cells are altered (and killed) in the lab to make them more likely to be attacked by the immune system and then injected back into the patient. The antigens are usually proteins or pieces of proteins called peptides. Doctors remove some immune cells from the patient’s blood and expose them in the lab to cancer cells or cancer antigens, as well as to other chemicals that turn the immune cells into dendritic cells and help them grow. The dendritic cells are then injected back into the patient, where they should cause an immune response to cancer cells in the body. Finally, these vaccines might be easier and less expensive to make than some other vaccines. This is not a complete list – vaccines are being studied in other types of cancer as well. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. These are known as oncolytic viruses. An example is talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), which is an oncolytic virus that has been modified to make GM-CSF, a protein that boosts the immune response. This treatment can sometimes shrink these tumors, but it has not been shown to shrink tumors in other parts of the body. These types of treatments show a lot of promise, but they are complex and so far are available only through clinical trials being done at major medical centers. These receptors will attach to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. These approvals are based on the results of clinical trials showing that in many patients the cancer could no longer be found after treatment. It is not yet clear if these treatments will result in a long-term cure. Researchers are also still learning about long-term side effects of these treatments. Doctors are still improving how they make the T cells and are learning the best ways to use them for different types of cancer. When injected back into the patient, these cells can be active cancer fighters. Treatments using TILs are being tested in clinical trials in people with melanoma, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer, and other cancers. Early studies of this approach by researchers from the National Cancer Institute have been promising, but its use may be limited because doctors might not be able to get TILs from all patients. Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests and bone marrow examination. ALL is typically treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at bringing about remission. This is then followed by further chemotherapy typically over a number of years. Treatment can also include radiation therapy if spread to the brain has occurred. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans. The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free. Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example. The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission. Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure. It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use. One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said. To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others. Grupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead. The young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy. After she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. She was dramatically better within hours. Tests showed her cancer was gone. For the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died. But after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. The pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. But what exactly is CAR T-cell therapy? We spoke with Sattva Neelapu, M.D., to learn more. Doctors extract T cells (a type of white blood cell) from the patient’s blood and then add an artificial receptor (called a “chimeric antigen receptor”) to their surface. CAR T-cell therapy can cause some unusual side effects. The most common side effect of CAR T-cell therapy is called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. It’s also known as a “cytokine storm.” About 70-90% of patients experience it, but it’s very short-term and only lasts about five to seven days. It usually starts around the second or third day after the infusion. There’s a very effective remedy for CRS now called tocilizumab, which reverses this side effect fairly quickly. The other side effect is known as “CRES,” which stands for “CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome.” It typically starts around day five after the infusion. Which types of cancer can CAR T-cell therapy treat currently? We have different FDA-approved cell therapy products for each of these cancers, thanks to clinical trials. Indolent B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. The reason it fails in some patients is that the tumor cells mutate quickly and shed the target molecule, so the CAR T-cells can’t “see” the cancer anymore. But first, we have to show that it’s at least as effective — or more effective — than those therapies. What are some advantages of CAR T-cell therapy? CAR T-cell therapy is also a living drug, and its benefits can last for many years. Since the cells can persist in the body long-term, they will still recognize and attack cancer cells if and when there’s a relapse. These are patients whose cancers were deemed very aggressive and for whom other standards of care had failed. What type of patient is a good candidate for CAR T-cell therapy? Until late 2017, there was no standard of care for someone who had already been through two lines of treatment and not achieved remission. How easy is it for patients to obtain CAR T-cell therapy? If they’ve already been through two lines of unsuccessful treatment, they can get the FDA-approved commercial product. So, patients should ask their doctors early on about clinical trial options when they are considering treatment for their cancer. What’s the one thing you want patients to know about CAR T-cell therapy? And it’s offering hope to people who’d previously been given only about six months to live.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. The virus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This outbreak has since caused a health issue in the city of Wuhan, China which evolved into a global pandemic. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Epidemiologists have also warned of the virus's contagiousness. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among \n\n Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers transmitted the virus to many people which eventually did show symptoms, some being deadly. The first number of cases was detected in Wuhan, China, the origin of the outbreak. Proper identification of a novel coronavirus was developed and reported, making the pneumonia cases in China the first reported cases of COVID-19. As of November 25, 2021, there have been around 260 million confirmed \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence. Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, masking, improving ventilation and air filtration, and quarantining those who have been exposed or are symptomatic. Treatments include monoclonal antibodies, novel antiviral drugs, and symptom control. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and tracing contacts of the infected. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented pollution decrease. The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. Etymology \nThe pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the \"coronavirus pandemic\", despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus outbreak\" and the \"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\" with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma. WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020. Epidemiology\n\nBackground \n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there, but it is possible that human-to-human transmission began earlier. The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal. Despite this, the subject has generated extensive speculation about alternative origins. The origin controversy heightened geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China. The earliest known infected person fell ill on 1December 2019. That individual did not have a connection with the later wet market cluster. Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected between mid-October and mid-November 2019. Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms. Multiple studies claimed that total infections are considerably greater than reported cases. On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 percent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies. Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies. It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested. A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected. In December 2021, the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors including new COVID-19 variants. Deaths \n\nAs of , more than  deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020. These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health. Conversely, deaths of people who died from underlying conditions following a positive test may be included. Countries such as Belgium include deaths from suspected cases, including those without a test, thereby increasing counts. Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 9.5 to 18.6 million by The Economist, as well as over 10.3 million by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Such deaths include deaths due to healthcare capacity constraints and priorities, as well as reluctance to seek care (to avoid possible infection). Mortality rates increase as a function of age. Other studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'. In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for various countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%. For comparison the IFR for middle-aged adults is two orders of magnitude more likely than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. This study reported that most of the differences reflected corresponding differences in the population's age structure and the age-specific pattern of infections. This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals. People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Transmission \n\nThe disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles (that form an aerosol) that infected people exhale as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 when they are physically close. Cause \n\nSARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, including livestock and companion animals, and avian species. Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Diagnosis \n\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\" The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. Vaccines \n\nA COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms during early 2020. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness. On 10 January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by 19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major commitment to address COVID‑19. The COVID‑19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID‑19. As of late-December 2021, more than 4.49 billion people had received one or more doses (8+ billion in total) in over 197 countries. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was the most widely used. Treatment \n\nFor the first two years of the pandemic no specific, effective treatment or cure was available. The antiviral remdesivir is available in the US, Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for use with mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to limited evidence of its efficacy. Variants \n\nSeveral variants have been named by WHO and labelled as a variant of concern (VoC) or a variant of interest (VoI). They share the more infectious D614G mutation: Delta dominated and then eliminated earlier VoC from most jurisdictions. Omicron's immune escape ability may allow it to spread via breakthrough infections, which in turn may allow it to coexist with Delta, which more often infects the unvaccinated. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Strategies \n\nMany countries attempted to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 by recommending, mandating or prohibiting behaviour changes, while others relied primarily on providing information. Experts differentiate between elimination strategies (commonly known as \"zero-COVID\")  that aim to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community,  and mitigation strategies (commonly known as \"flattening the curve\") that attempt to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerate some level of transmission within the community. These initial strategies can be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Nature reported in 2021 that 90% of immunologists who responded to a survey \"think that the coronavirus will become endemic\". Containment \n\nContainment is undertaken to stop an outbreak from spreading into the general population. Infected individuals are isolated while they are infectious. The people they have interacted with are contacted and isolated for long enough to ensure that they are either not infected or no longer contagious. Screening is the starting point for containment. Successful containment or suppression reduces Rt to less than 1. Mitigation \n\nShould containment fail, efforts focus on mitigation: measures taken to slow the spread and limit its effects on the healthcare system and society. Successful mitigation delays and decreases the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the epidemic curve\". This decreases the risk of overwhelming health services and provides more time for developing vaccines and treatments. Non-pharmaceutical interventions \n\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions that may reduce spread include personal actions such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at reducing interpersonal contacts such as closing workplaces and schools and cancelling large gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. Other measures \nMore drastic actions, such as quarantining entire populations and strict travel bans have been attempted in various jurisdictions. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. The pandemic drove widespread adoption of telehealth. Improvised manufacturing \nDue to capacity supply chains limitations, some manufacturers began 3D printing material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts. On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is undergoing further testing. Millions of face shields, protective gowns, and masks were made. Herd immunity \nIn July 2021, several experts expressed concern that achieving herd immunity may not be possible because Delta can transmit among vaccinated individuals. CDC published data showing that vaccinated people could transmit Delta, something officials believed was less likely with other variants. Consequently, WHO and CDC encouraged vaccinated people to continue with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking, social distancing, and quarantining if exposed. It is possible that human-to-human transmission was happening before the discovery. A pneumonia cluster was observed on 26 December and treated by Doctor Zhang Jixian. Vision Medicals reported the discovery of a novel coronavirus to the China CDC (CCDC) on 28 December. On 30 December, a test report from CapitalBio Medlab addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital reported an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing doctors there to alert authorities. On 31 December, the WHO office in China was informed of cases of the pneumonia cases and immediately launched an investigation. However, in May 2020, CCDC director George Gao indicated the market was not the origin (animal samples had tested negative). 2020 \n\nOn 11 January, WHO was notified by the Chinese National Health Commission that the outbreak was associated with exposures in the market, and that China had identified a new type of coronavirus, which it isolated on 7 January. Initially, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days. On 10 January, the virus' genome was shared through GISAID. A 24 January report indicated human transmission, recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and advocated testing, given the outbreak's \"pandemic potential\". On 31 January the first published modelling study warned of inevitable \"independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally\" and called for \"large-scale public health interventions.\" On 30 January, 7,818 infections had been confirmed, leading WHO to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). On 11 March, WHO elevated it to a pandemic. By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections. Genomic analysis indicated that the majority of New York's confirmed infections came from Europe, rather than directly from Asia. Testing of prior samples revealed a person who was infected in France on 27 December 2019 and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February. In October, WHO reported that one in ten people around the world may have been infected, or 780 million people, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed. That day, Novavax entered an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine. The variant, later named Alpha, showed changes to the spike protein that could be more infectious. 2021 \n\nOn 2 January, the Alpha variant, first discovered in the UK, had been identified in 33 countries. On 6 January, the Gamma variant was first identified in Japanese travellers returning from Brazil. On 20 March, the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link to thrombus, leading several countries to resume the vaccine. In March WHO reported that an animal host was the most likely origin, without ruling out other possibilities. The Delta variant was first identified in India. In mid-April, the variant was first detected in the UK and two months later it had metastasized into a third wave there, forcing the government to delay reopening that was originally scheduled for June. On 10 November, Germany advised against the Moderna vaccine for people under 30. On 24 November, the Omicron variant was detected in South Africa; a few days later the World Health Organization declared it a VoC (variant of concern). The new variant is more infectious than the Delta variant. On 14 January, the World Health Organization recommended two new treatments, Baricitinib, and Sotrovimab (although conditionally). On 24 January, it was reported that about 57% of the world has been infected by COVID-19, per the  Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Model. However, cumulatively they had experienced only half the world average. The vaccines distributed in China included the BIBP, WIBP, and CoronaVac. It was reported on 11 December 2021 that China had vaccinated 1.162 billion of its citizens, or 82.5% of the total population of the country against COVID-19. However, since March 2020, China's large scale adoption of Zero-COVID has largely contained the disease, with external experts agreeing with the accuracy of China's infection numbers and deaths since the initial outbreak. The first case in India was reported on 30 January 2020. On 21 October 2021, it was reported that the country had surpassed 1 billion vaccinations. Military bases were quarantined after tests showed three infected soldiers. Despite some early criticisms, South Korea's programme was considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities. By 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic and it remained so until the WHO announced it has been overtaken by South America on 22 May. Despite deployment of COVID-19 vaccines, Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late 2021. On 10 November Italy surpassed 1 million confirmed infections. On 23 November, it was reported that the second wave of the virus had led some hospitals to stop accepting patients. The Swedish strategy focused on longer-term measures, based on the assumption that after lockdown the virus would resume spreading, with the same result. By the end of June, Sweden no longer had excess mortality. confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with  deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On 13 May 2020, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of COVID-19 infection with 23,091 deaths. On 22 May 2020, citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the World Health Organization WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic. As of 16 July 2021, South America had recorded 34,359,631 confirmed cases and 1,047,229 deaths from COVID-19. Due to a shortage of testing and medical facilities, it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show. On 19 June 2020, the country reported its one millionth case and nearly 49,000 reported deaths. One estimate of under-reporting was 22.62% of total reported COVID-19 mortality in 2020. As of , Brazil, with  confirmed cases and  deaths, has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only those of the United States and of India. The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February 2020. Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated. In early June 2021, Africa faced a third wave of COVID infections with cases rising in 14 countries. By 4 July the continent recorded more than 251,000 new COVID cases, a 20% increase from the prior week and a 12% increase from the January peak. It has since spread elsewhere in the region, although many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As a result of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant, however, by August 2021, the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts. Antarctica \n\nDue to its remoteness and sparse population, Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was one of the last regions of the world affected directly by the pandemic. The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in China. At least 36 people are confirmed to have been infected. Other responses \n\nThe pandemic shook the world's economy, with especially severe economic damage in the United States, Europe, and Latin America. A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded, \"Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally, as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups.\" Travel restrictions \n\nThe pandemic led many countries and regions to impose quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas, or for all travellers. The effectiveness of travel restrictions was questioned as the virus spread across the world. Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to do so. On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative, while four who showed symptoms were left behind. WHO \n\nThe WHO spearheaded initiatives such as the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response, the UN COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force, and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease. By contrast, petroleum products were in surplus at the beginning of the pandemic, as demand for gasoline and other products collapsed due to reduced commuting and other trips. The US intelligence community claimed that China intentionally under-reported its COVID-19 caseload. Some political analysts claimed that the pandemic contributed to President Donald Trump's 2020 defeat. Food systems \n\nThe pandemic disrupted food systems worldwide, hitting at a time when hunger/undernourishment was rising (an estimated 690 million people lacked food security in 2019). The pandemic and its accompanying lockdowns and travel restrictions slowed movement of food aid. Per the World Health Organization 811 million individuals  were undernourished in 2020, \"likely related to the fallout of COVID-19\". They shed light on social and economic issues, including student debt, digital learning, food insecurity, and homelessness, as well as access to childcare, health care, housing, internet, and disability services. Health \n\nThe pandemic impacted global health for many other conditions. The pandemic impacted mental health, increasing anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, affecting healthcare workers, patients and quarantined individuals. Environment \n\nThe pandemic and the reaction to it positively affected the environment and climate as a result of reduced human activity. Earth systems scientist Marshall Burke estimated that two months of pollution reduction likely saved the lives of 77,000 Chinese residents. Reports from February 2020 (when most confirmed cases were confined to China) cited racist sentiments about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus. This was attributed to their perceived vulnerability and subsequent physical and social isolation measures, which, coupled with their reduced social activity, increased dependency on others. Lifestyle changes \nThe pandemic triggered massive changes in behaviour, from increased Internet commerce to cultural changes in the job market. Some newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their pandemic-related articles and posts, Some scientific publishers made pandemic-related papers available with open access. Misinformation \n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic are widespread. WHO declared an \"infodemic\" of incorrect information. Cognitive biases, such as jumping to conclusions and confirmation bias, were linked to conspiracy beliefs.

Brand names of viscosupplementation solutions include Hylagan, Orthovisc, Supartz, and Synvisc – all of which we use at Unique Pain Medicine. During the procedure, a thick gel with a natural protein, hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid, is injected into the knee joint to provide lubrication and reduce inflammation. INJECTIONS CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO KNEE SURGERY, WHILE OTHERS, RELY ON THESE INJECTIONS FOR RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN CAUSED BY AN INJURY OR OSTEOARTHRITIS. Viscosupplementation works by artificially supplementing the fluid in the joint which increases the viscosity or thickness of the lubrication. After proper sterilization, a needle is placed into the joint under live ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance. A pre-filled syringe of viscosupplementation is then injected into the joint to help loosen the knee and reduce friction thereby decreasing pain, minimizing inflammation, and improving motion. This artificial lubrication will ideally “save” your knee from further deterioration, and help you to avoid surgery. Adds lubrication to the joint which restores movement and minimizes pain. Hip osteoarthritis (OA) and degeneration. Shoulder osteoarthritis (OA) and degeneration. Know what is Viscosupplementation injection for knee joint pain relief, is viscosupplementation effective, its side effects & costs, when is it recommended etc. Get clue about whether your joint pain can be treated with Viscosupplementation! For the patients of osteoarthritis who suffer from knee joint pain but do not want to go for knee replacement surgery, there is an alternative knee treatment known as Viscosupplementation. Poor lubrication due to low hyaluronic acid (HA) levels is one of such causes for osteoarthritis knee pain. Viscosupplomementation is a treatment which involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into the joints to supplement the viscous properties of synovial (lubricating) fluid. Viscosupplementation can also be achieved by taking oral supplements. However, injecting hyaluronic acid into the affected joint is the most prevalent treatment technique. See this viscosupplementation injection video which displays the technique of injection with viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of right elbow joint. Is Viscosupplementation Effective for Knee Joint Pain? However, not all patients of osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation. Only those patients who have mild to moderate osteoarthritis have shown significant improvement in their pain condition. Those having advanced destructive osteoarthritis with chronic knee pain do not seem to have any beneficial effect from viscosupplement injections. When the patients of osteoarthritis with mild to moderate knee joint pain do not get any relief from the following traditional treatments, they are recommended by the doctors to take viscosupplementation treatment. Joint aspiration and intra-articular LA/steroid injection. Once taken, the viscosupplementation injection is effective for 6-8 months. What is the Cost for Viscosupplementation Injection? What are the Side Effects of Viscosupplementation? The side effects of viscosupplement injections are generally mild. The most common side effects are local reactions at the knee joint such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. Viscosupplementation treatment is, till date, available for treating knee joint pains only. Watch the video on viscosupplementation treatments in India for more information on the subject. Euflexxa is an injectable medication used to treat knee pain in people with osteoarthritis (\"wear-and-tear arthritis\"). This fluid thins and become less able to lubricate and protect the knee joint as the inflammatory stress of osteoarthritis takes its toll. The two-step process of drainage and joint lubrication is known as arthrocentesis plus viscosupplementation. After drainage, the Euflexxa injection is delivered into the joint space in the mid-kneecap region. Despite the potential benefits of treatment, viscosupplementation success rates can vary dramatically. What most doctors will agree is that viscosupplementation is not a quick fix. It is really only considered when conservative options have failed or as a means to delay more invasive procedures, such as knee surgery or knee replacement. It is also often used in place of traditional corticosteroid knee injections. Furthermore, repeated corticosteroid shots can actually accelerate cartilage damage. While effective, it only provides short-term relief of knee stiffness and pain. It does not regrow lost cartilage or reverse the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Doing so may reduce the weight-bearing stress on your knee and help you better control your symptoms without the need for intra-articular medications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and can be a major source of disability. Many older patients continue to be active in sports-related activities; therefore, the treatment of the active patient with osteoarthritis is becoming more common. There are no guidelines for the administration of corticosteroids, and they can be associated with increased risk of tendon rupture and infection. Viscosupplementation has gained popularity in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and can be a major source of disability. Traditional nonoperative treatment includes activity modification, weight loss, exercise, assistive devices, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs), analgesics, and corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is effective, but not indicated for early stages of the disease in all patients. Intraarticular corticosteroids are accepted as an important treatment modality, but currently there are no guidelines in regard to administration. In recent years, intraarticular viscosupplementation with hyaluronate-derived products has gained popularity as a modality for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. The content of synovial fluid (lubricating fluid of joint), in the presence of osteoarthritis, has a decreased concentration and molecular weight of hyaluronic acid. Injections decrease inflammation and swelling, which decreases pain and increases joint mobility. Therefore, it is thought that the primary effect of the corticosteroid is on the synovium. There is no clear, objective evidence for intraarticular corticosteroid injections on the treatment of osteoarthritic or sports-related injuries of knees, ankles, shoulders, acromioclavicular joints, lumbar facet joints, and smaller hand and foot joints. Injections around joints are associated with significant risk. Corticosteroid injections could cause ligament and tendon rupture, which is the reason many orthopedists do not recommend corticosteroid injections in these locations. Active infection of the skin and overlying tissues increases the risk of inoculating the joint during injection. Other absolute contraindications are hypersensitivity, presence of a joint prosthesis, and uncontrolled bleeding diathesis. Relative contraindications include anticoagulation therapy, joint instability, poorly controlled diabetes, and adjacent skin abrasions. The local effects include tendon and ligament rupture, cutaneous atrophy at the injection site, calcification of the joint capsule, and infection. They are approved for use in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The most common side effects are local reactions of the knee such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. There are many stages of osteoarthritis, in various locations, and in different patient populations. They are relatively inexpensive and safe, but do not have clear, long-term benefits, and can damage collagen structures surrounding joints. Orthopedic surgeons need to continue to use corticosteroids cautiously and conservatively. As older patients increase their activity and demand on their joints, there needs to be further research into the value and efficacy of hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis of the knee. Viscosupplementation injections are used as a treatment for knee joint pain relief, particularly in patients with osteoarthritis who do not wish to undergo knee replacement surgery. The purpose of these injections is to supplement the lubricating properties of the synovial fluid in the joints, which helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. The injection involves the introduction of gel-like substances, called hyaluronates, into the affected joint. By increasing synovial fluid levels of HA, viscosupplementation injections have been effective in reducing pain by decreasing levels of inflammatory substances called prostaglandins. It is important to note that not all patients with osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation injections. Significant improvement in pain has been observed in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis. However, patients with advanced destructive osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain may not experience the same level of benefits. Please consult with a healthcare professional to determine whether viscosupplementation injections are a suitable option for your specific condition.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Vaginal-lining cells were \n\n Vaginal aplasia is a rare medical condition in which the vagina does not form properly before birth. Sufferers of the condition may have a partially formed vagina, or none at all. First a space is surgically created where the vagina would typically exist. Then tissue from another part of the body is harvested, molded into the shape of a vagina, and grafted into the vagina cavity. Typically, the implanted tissue does not function normally as a muscle, which can lead to low enjoyment of sexual intercourse. It is a type of genitoplasty. Surgery to the vagina is done to correct congenital defects to the vagina, urethra  and rectum. Often, a vaginoplasty is performed to repair the vagina and its attached structures due to trauma or injury. Labiaplasty, which alters the appearance of the vulva, can be performed as a discrete surgery, or as a subordinate procedure within a vaginoplasty. Congenital disorders such as adrenal hyperplasia can affect the structure and function of the vagina and sometimes the vagina is absent; these can be reconstructed or formed, using a vaginoplasty. Other candidates for the surgery include babies born with a microphallus, people with Müllerian agenesis resulting in vaginal hypoplasia, trans women, and women who have had a vaginectomy after malignancy or trauma. Vaginoplasty can reduce the size of the entrance of the vagina or alter the appearance of the vulva. A woman can use an autologous in vitro cultured tissue taken from her vaginal vestibule as transplanted tissue to form the lining of the reconstructed vagina. A reconstructed or newly constructed vagina is called a neovagina. Vaginoplasties in children \n\nConditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia virilize genetic females due to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Specific procedures include: clitoral reduction, labiaplasty, normalizing appearance, vagina creation, initiating vaginal dilation. Vaginal atresia, or congenital absence of the vagina can be another reason for surgery to construct a normal and functional vagina. There are human rights concerns about vaginoplasties and other genital surgeries in children who are not old enough to consent, including concern with post-surgical sexual function, and assumptions of cisnormativity. Vaginoplasties may be performed in children or adolescents with intersex conditions or disorders of sex development. Techniques\nNon-surgical vagina creation was used in the past to treat the congenital absence of a vagina. Vaginoplasty is often performed to reconstruct the vagina and other genital structures. In some cases, normal sexual function can be restored. Other materials have been used to create the lining of the new vagina. Sex reassignment surgery \nSeveral techniques may be used in sex reassignment surgery to create a vagina. Penile inversion \nInversion of the penile skin is the method most often selected to create a neovagina by surgeons performing sex reassignment surgery. The penile inversion technique was pioneered by Georges Burou in his Morocco clinic in the 1950s. Bowel vaginoplasty\nBowel vaginoplasty is another commonly used method to create a neovagina in sex reassignment surgery. Compared to penile inversion, bowel vaginoplasty has the advantages of self-lubrication, depth, and reduced risk of stenosis. However, it carries the disadvantages of requiring abdominal surgery and the creation of a bowel anastomosis, excessive discharge and/or malodour, and prolapsed neovagina. Other methods \nPenile-scrotal skin flaps are also used. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) criteria for genital (\"bottom\") surgery (orchiectomy and vaginoplasty in male-to-female transgender individuals) include:\n Two referral letters from qualified mental health professionals. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a warning against these procedures in 2007 as did the Royal Australian College of Gynaecologists, and a commentary in the British Medical Journal strongly criticized the \"designer vagina\" in 2009. The World Health Organization describes any medically unnecessary surgery to the vaginal tissue and organs as female genital mutilation. A hymenorrhaphy is the surgical procedure that reconstructs the hymen. Pull through or Vecchietti procedure \nIn treating Müllerian agenesis, the Vecchietti procedure is a laparoscopic surgical technique that produces a vagina of dimensions (depth and width) comparable to those of a normal vagina (ca. A small, plastic sphere (“olive”) is threaded (sutured) against the vaginal area; the threads are drawn though the vaginal skin, up through the abdomen, and through the navel. There, the threads are attached to a traction device, and then daily are drawn tight so that the “olive” is pulled inwards and stretches the vagina, by approximately 1.0 cm. per day, thereby creating a vagina, approximately 7.0 cm. The most widely used is the Vecchietti laparoscopic procedure. Sometimes sexual intercourse can result in the dilation of a newly constructed vagina.

What Are the Risks Associated With Heart Transplants? More than 2,000 heart transplants are performed each year in the U.S. Each year thousands more would benefit from a heart transplant if more donated hearts were available. People who have advanced (end stage) heart failure, but are otherwise healthy, may be considered for a heart transplant. Can you adhere to the lifestyle changes, including complex drug treatments and frequent exams, required after a transplant? If you answered 'no' to any of the above questions, a heart transplant may not be for you. Also, if you have additional medical problems, such as other severe diseases, active infections, or severe obesity, you most likely will not be considered a candidate for transplant. In order to get a heart transplant, you must first be placed on a transplant list. But, before you can be placed on the transplant list, you must go through a careful screening process. A team of heart doctors, nurses, social workers, and bioethicists review your medical history, diagnostic test results, social history, and psychological test results to see if you are able to survive the procedure and then comply with the continuous care needed to live a long, healthy life. Donors for heart transplants are individuals who may have recently died or become brain dead, which means that although their body is being kept alive by machines, the brain has no sign of life. Many times, these donors died as a result of a car accident, severe head injury, or a gunshot wound. Donor organs are located through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computerized national waiting list. This waiting list assures equal access and fair distribution of organs when they become available. The race and gender of the donor have no bearing on the match. All donors are screened for Hepatitis B and C and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Unfortunately, not enough hearts are available for transplant. At any given time, almost 3,500 to 4,000 people are waiting for a heart or heart-lung transplant. A person may wait months for a transplant and more than 25% do not live long enough to get one. Many people who are waiting for transplantation have mixed feelings, because they are aware that someone must die before an organ becomes available. It may help to know that many donor families feel a sense of peace knowing that some good has come from their loved one's death. Once a donor heart becomes available, a surgeon from the transplant center surgically removes the heart from the donor's body. The surgeon will make sure the donor heart is in good condition before beginning the transplant surgery. The backs of the atria on the donor heart are opened and the heart is sewn into place. And many of them have no symptoms, such as angina, because they have no sensation in their donor hearts. Rejection occurs when the body's immune cells recognize the transplanted heart as different from the rest of the body and attempt to destroy it. If left alone, the immune system would damage the cells of a donor heart and eventually destroy it. To prevent rejection, patients receive several drugs called immunosuppressants. These drugs suppress the immune system so that the donor heart is not damaged. Because rejection can occur anytime after a transplant, immunosuppressive drugs are given to patients the day before their transplant and thereafter for the rest of their lives. To avoid rejection, heart transplant recipients must strictly adhere to their immunosuppressant drug regimen. Without an active enough immune system, a patient can easily develop severe infections. Doctors frequently take samples of small pieces of the transplanted heart to inspect under a microscope. With the exception of having to take lifelong medication to keep the body from rejecting the donor heart, many heart transplant recipients lead long and productive lives. The most important are those to keep the body from rejecting the transplant. Heart transplant recipients are encouraged to exercise to improve the function of the heart and to avoid weight gain. However, due to changes in the heart related to the transplant, patients should speak to their doctor or cardiac rehabilitation specialist before beginning an exercise program. Because the nerves leading to the heart are cut during the operation, the transplanted heart beats faster (about 100 to 110 beats per minute) than the normal heart (about 70 beats per minute). After transplant, the patient may need to follow a special diet, which may involve many of the same dietary changes made prior to surgery. The 10-year survival rate is about 56%. The 35-year-old was suffering irreparable heart failure that would see her rely on life support, then an artificial heart and ultimatley organ transplant. We would need to put her on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)”, Dr Tan said. Dr Peter Bergin, Medical Director of the Heart Failure and Transplant Service at The Alfred, said there were no warning signs that Petra was born with an unusual heart. It was made possible by advanced life support technology, a dedicated and diverse surgical, respirology, intensive care and perfusion team, as well as the grit and gumption of the patient, Melissa Benoit, and her close-knit family. \"This was bold and very challenging, but Melissa was dying before our eyes,\" recalls Dr. Shaf Keshavjee, Surgeon-in-Chief, Sprott Department of Surgery at UHN, one of three thoracic surgeons who operated together on Melissa to remove both her lungs. \"Melissa gave us the courage to go ahead.\" For the past three years, Melissa, who has cystic fibrosis, had been prescribed antibiotics to fight off increasingly frequent chest infections. A recent bout of influenza just before her hospital admission had left Melissa gasping for air, with coughing fits so harsh that she fractured her ribs. As Dr. Niall Ferguson, Head of Critical Care Medicine at UHN and Mount Sinai Hospital, describes it, the influenza \"tipped her over the edge into respiratory failure. Her only hope of recovery was a lung transplant.\" Melissa's oxygen levels dipped so low, conventional ventilation was no longer enough. Despite this, Melissa's condition worsened. The bacteria in her lungs developed resistance to most antibiotics, and spread throughout her body. Melissa was now on maximum doses of three medications to maintain her blood pressure, along with the most advanced respiratory support, and on last-line powerful antibiotics, the last option for patients resistant to other available antibiotics. The team was still waiting for donor lungs but, by this time, Melissa was too sick to have a lung transplant. Removing both her lungs – the source of bacterial infection – could save her life. Dr. Cypel gathered his colleagues, calling in Dr. Keshavjee, Dr. Tom Waddell, Head of Thoracic Surgery at UHN, Dr. Ferguson, and respirologist Dr. Mathew Binnie – all seasoned and well-known for their skills in navigating complex cases, along with Melissa's husband, mom and dad. They had observed patients with cystic fibrosis, waiting for a lung transplant, who developed severe lung infections. While the team faced many unknowns – risk of bleeding into an empty chest cavity, whether her blood pressure and oxygen levels could be supported afterwards, and if she would even survive the operation – they agreed that Melissa was a possible candidate, and that it was her only chance, although a slim one. As Dr. Keshavjee explained, she likely still had enough strength to withstand the procedure and get better afterwards; the source of the infection was clear-cut and difficult to control in current circumstances; the family understood the risks and explained that Melissa had often told them she would want to try everything possible to live for her husband, Chris, and two-year-old daughter, Olivia. \"Things were so bad for so long, we needed something to go right,\" remembers, Chris, \"and this new procedure was the first piece of good news in a long time. As Melissa tells it, Chris was the one who \"held my life in his hands...He had to trust in himself, knowing me, relying on past conversations, and he chose exactly what I would have told him to.\" Melissa's mom, Sue, was so eager to save her daughter's life, she urged the team to go ahead: \"Melissa always volunteers for any study or clinical trial. To keep Melissa alive, she was placed on the most sophisticated support possible for her heart and lungs. Six days later, a pair of donor lungs became available and Melissa was stable enough to receive a lung transplant in late April 2016. The medical team is developing criteria for the select types of patients who could be candidates for this novel procedure while waiting for a lung transplantation. He also warns her that the procedure is still in its infancy; for a year, Gwen will have to take shots every two hours to help her breathe and will \n\nThis section of the Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN) website provides basic information to those waiting for an organ and tissue transplant and those that have received the gift of life. Putting plans in place to meet the needs of current and future transplants. Using electronic information and technology to support healthcare professionals to improve safety, quality and efficiency TGLN continues to grow the awareness and importance of organ and tissue donation and transplantation in the drive to save and enhance lives. There are hundreds of diseases that affect organs and tissues to the point that a transplant is required, but not everybody that suffers from disease requires one. Organs that can be transplanted are the liver, small bowel, kidney, pancreas, heart, and lung. This kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment options fail. Post surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Lungs can come from either a deceased or living donor. A transplant may be recommended if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases, or primary pulmonary hypertension, among others. As with other transplants, you must take medication to prevent your body from rejecting the new heart. Islet cell transplantation replaces only the part of the pancreas that makes insulin. Transplanted islet cells come from deceased donors. People who have transplants must take medication to keep their body from rejecting the new organ. After surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Tissue transplantation includes corneas, skin, bone, cardiovascular tissue the islet cells of the pancreas and connective tissue. One donor can provide tissue for many recipients undergoing various procedures. Skin is one of the most common types of tissue transplanted. Some people think that age determines whether they can register to donate their skin - The fact is, everyone is a potential donor. One of the most successful achievements in the history of medicine is in the world of transplantation. Canada is still faced with a greater need for organs and tissue than the number available for transplantation. Islet cells are transplanted into a patient with Diabetes in Edmonton, Alberta (now called the Edmonton Protocol). First living-related double lung transplant, where two people each donated part of a lung in Winnipeg, Manitoba. “Halifax Protocol” – the successful combination of two anti- rejection drugs that drastically reduces organ rejection – earns international attention in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Even though the list of people waiting for a lifesaving or transforming transplant continues to be long, the success rates for transplants continue to improve each year. If you are thinking about transplantation or are already on the organ/tissue transplant waiting list, you probably have lots of questions. The following pages provide a few basic answers to help you as you move through your transplantation journey. Don’t be afraid to raise any questions with your healthcare team at your transplant centre. Once you and your primary care physician have discussed transplantation as an option and agreed to move forward, you will be referred to a team of specialists in the Transplant Centre. You will be invited to meet the specialists at the Transplant Program to determine your suitability for transplantation. If the results of your assessment indicate that you are a suitable candidate and you determine to move forward for transplantation, you will be placed on the waitlist. The specialists along with other healthcare professionals are part of the transplant team that will be treating you throughout your journey. Should transplantation be deemed unneeded or unsafe, alternative options will be presented to you. Do I have a choice other than transplantation? What are the organ and patient survival rates for my type of transplant at this hospital? How many of my type of transplant do you perform each year? When an organ is available for transplant how do you decide who will get it? Does the hospital do living donor transplants? Is a living donor transplant a choice in my case? Once you and your transplant team have agreed to pursue transplantation, you will be placed on the waitlist. Once a donor organ is deemed suitable there is a matching system to ensure that the distribution of organs is based on fair criteria. These may include suitable blood type match, medical urgency, the amount of time already spent on the waiting list, the size of the organ(s) needed, and other factors. Since an organ can become available at any time, it is important to stay as healthy as possible. Your transplant team and primary care physician will be able to help. Many patients waiting for heart, heart-lung or lung transplantation face financial barriers in accessing transplantation. The Transplant Patient Expense Reimbursement (TPER) program, funded by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, was created to relieve some of the financial burden to the patient. The program provides reimbursement to transplant patients for limited accommodation-related expenses. If the transplant hospital requires the patient to temporarily relocate closer to the transplant hospital to access a life-saving transplant, some of the costs for the patient may be covered. Carefully plan your transplant and be sure to include your caregivers and family in this process. Support and preparatory tools are available through your Transplant Program. The Transplant Program may be calling you regarding an available organ. Transplantation is major surgery and it will probably take time before you are managing your own care. Having a functioning transplant may provide a completely different view on life for you. The length of hospital stay after the surgery will vary by patient and type of transplant. Shortly after discharge from the hospital, you will begin to make frequent visits to the Transplant Program for follow-up examinations. Check with your transplant team before you begin any exercise program. Prior to returning you will need to receive permission from your transplant team. You may experience an episode of rejection, which refers to when your body attacks the newly transplanted organ. Your transplant team knows how to manage rejection with medication. After treatment, most people live normally with their transplanted organ. Talk with your transplant team should you have any questions. Talk to your transplant team. Speak to your transplant team for more information. When the time is right you may want to express your feelings to your donor’s family. Consider writing a letter to the donor family and let them know how grateful you feel. In Canada, the identities of the recipient, the donor and both their families are kept confidential out of respect for everyone’s right to personal privacy. Organ donation from one individual can help up to 8 others. Living Donation occurs when a living person donates an organ or part of an organ for transplant to another person in need. It is one of the most important sources of organs for transplantation. This is why it is critically important to encourage colleagues, friends and family to consider registering their consent to organ and tissue donation. Living donors are most often family members or close friends of the recipient. Other types of living donation are available and include anonymous donation, list exchange and paired exchange. Living donation has the potential to reduce wait times to a matter of months rather than possibly years for deceased donation. Typically, the organ donated by a living donor is healthier at the time of the operation. This often leads to a better-functioning organ and longer graft survival. From the donor’s perspective, there is often a sense of pride in saving or improving the life of another. To minimize the potential financial burdens associated with the living donation process, the Government of Ontario established the Program for Reimbursing Expenses of Living Organ Donors (PRELOD). Potential and actual Living Organ Donors may apply to PRELOD for reimbursement of eligible expenses. For hard copy versions of the application forms, please visit your Transplant Hospital. Living donors are blood relatives. Living donors are spouses, partners, in-law relatives, close friends, and co-workers. The willing donors are matched with the other's respective recipient so that each recipient can receive a kidney with a compatible blood type. The Living Donor Paired Exchange (LDPE) registry is administered by Canadian Blood Services. The first step for anyone wishing to be an anonymous donor is to contact the transplant coordinator at the transplant hospital nearest to them. For more information, please see the Canadian Blood Services website: Living Donation. Although transplantation - from either a living or a deceased donor - is not a cure for kidney disease, it may prolong and enhance one's quality of life. Living kidney donors must be older than 18 and generally less than 70 years of age, in good general health without any evidence of significant high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and heart disease or hepatitis. Gender and race are not factors in determining who can donate. This decision to offer to donate is yours alone to make. Speak with the social worker or counselor affiliated with the transplant team or a living donation coordinator. When a potential donor has access to another living donor and others such as living donor support groups, they are better prepared to make a decision. While the consequences of donating a kidney are minimal and few, there are some precautions that should be taken. Any kidney donor who becomes pregnant after donating should let her physician know so that as a precaution, kidney function can be monitored. The potential donor must be in good overall health and physical condition, have a liver that is the right size for the recipient and have a blood type that is compatible with the recipient. The other consideration is that the donor must have a Body Mass Index of < 35 to be worked up for consideration of being a liver donor. It is important that you discuss your decision to donate with the transplant team, a living donation coordinator, as well as with the recipient and the families involved. The transplant team will determine whether or not you are mentally, emotionally and physically fit to become a donor. The good news is that the evaluation process takes place in stages, leaving time between appointments for a donor to discuss any questions or concerns as they arise. If at any time you decide that donating is not for you, you should inform your contact on the transplant team right away. The Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN) and the Ontario Renal Network (ORN) has partnered to improve access to living donation and kidney transplantation for all Ontario patients with chronic kidney disease. Ministry providing news, programs and resources to help people stay healthy, delivering good care when people need it, and protecting the health system for future generations.

Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. Signs and symptoms\n\nOsteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. The term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Risk factors\n\nRisk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable\n\n The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable\n Excessive alcohol: Although small amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not been conclusively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis   A meta-analysis of published medical studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show significant improvement with other bones. Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people. Low-level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased risk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia (softening of the bone). Medical disorders\n\nMany diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown. For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute. People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis. Chronic kidney disease can lead to renal osteodystrophy. Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, leukemia, mastocytosis, hemophilia, sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Several inherited or genetic disorders have been linked to osteoporosis. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome, Multicentric Osteolysis, Nodulosis, and Arthropathy, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), glycogen storage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes' syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher's disease. People with scoliosis of unknown cause also have a higher risk of osteoporosis. People with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk of broken bones. Medication\nCertain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs. Steroid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP) arises due to use of glucocorticoids – analogous to Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Barbiturates, phenytoin and some other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics – these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D.\n L-Thyroxine over-replacement may contribute to osteoporosis, in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does. This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism. Anticoagulants – long-term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density, and warfarin (and related coumarins) have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long-term use. Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors of PPARγ, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. Pathogenesis\n\nThe underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost & Thomas in 1963. The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to mesenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age. :58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:\n\nThe International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Screening\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70‑year‑old. Prevention\n\nLifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures. While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death, an increased risk of myocardial infarctions  kidney stones, and stomach problems is associated with calcium supplementation,\n\nVitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. Physical exercise \nThere is limited evidence indicating that exercise is helpful in promoting bone health. There is some evidence that physical exercise may be beneficial for bone density in postmenopausal women and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Neither contribute to slowing bone loss with age, and professional bicycle racing has a negative effect on bone density. Low-quality evidence suggests that exercise may improve pain and quality of life of people with vertebral fractures and there is moderate-quality evidence that exercise will likely improve physical performance in individuals with vertebral fractures. Physical therapy \nPeople with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. There are conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, therefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on drugs. Management\n\nLifestyle\nWeight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Medications \n\nBisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis. This benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. For those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture, evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. There is tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis. Fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, there is not clear evidence of benefit in males. Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Prognosis\n\nAlthough people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal. Fractures\nHip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing. Epidemiology\n\nIt is estimated that 200 million people have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. Postmenopausal women have a higher rate of osteoporosis and fractures than older men. Postmenopausal women have decreased estrogen which contributes to their higher rates of osteoporosis. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture. It has been shown that latitude affects risk of osteoporotic fracture. There is also an association between Celiac Disease and increased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually for related healthcare costs. History\nThe link between age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. French pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. Signs and symptoms\n\nOsteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. The term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Risk factors\n\nRisk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable\n\n The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable\n Excessive alcohol: Although small amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not been conclusively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear.

Studies have shown that bisphosphonate medications like Bondronat may increase the risk of atypical femur fractures and a disfiguring jaw injury known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Bondronat Bone Fracture Update 5/24/12: In a study published this week by the Archives of Internal Medicine, Swiss researchers reached conclusions similar to those reached earlier this month by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) – that taking osteoporosis drugs from the bisphosphonate class can increase the risk of atypical bone fractures. Taken cumulatively, the results of the study seem to suggest that the risk of fractures increased over time while the benefits of the drugs decreased. Osteoporosis is a chronic debilitating disease that affects approximately 45 million people nationwide, typically affecting post-menopausal women by decreasing the density and strength of bones. If left untreated, osteoporosis can lead to severe fractures of the spine, hip and thigh. As the population of our nation continues to age, so too will the number of people suffering from the effects of osteoporosis continue to increase. Drugs from the bisphosphonate class are designed to bind tightly to tissue, thereby preventing calcium from being removed and sustaining bone density.

Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute. People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are at increased risk of osteoporosis, either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to osteoporosis. Chronic kidney disease can lead to renal osteodystrophy. Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis are multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, leukemia, mastocytosis, hemophilia, sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Several inherited or genetic disorders have been linked to osteoporosis. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Multicentric carpotarsal osteolysis syndrome, Multicentric Osteolysis, Nodulosis, and Arthropathy, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), glycogen storage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes' syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher's disease. People with scoliosis of unknown cause also have a higher risk of osteoporosis. People with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk of broken bones. Medication\nCertain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence is emerging with regard to other drugs. Steroid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP) arises due to use of glucocorticoids – analogous to Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Barbiturates, phenytoin and some other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics – these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D.\n L-Thyroxine over-replacement may contribute to osteoporosis, in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does. This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism. Anticoagulants – long-term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density, and warfarin (and related coumarins) have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long-term use. Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors of PPARγ, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is an obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. Pathogenesis\n\nThe underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost & Thomas in 1963. The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to mesenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH. This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. Local production of eicosanoids and interleukins is thought to participate in the regulation of bone turnover, and excess or reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporosis. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. In addition to the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modifiable underlying causes; this may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying problem, investigations for cancer with metastasis to the bone, multiple myeloma, Cushing's disease and other above-mentioned causes may be performed. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebral fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follow-up. But because bone density decreases with age, more people become osteoporotic with increasing age. :58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines:\n\nThe International Society for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis. The method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Screening\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk equal to that of a 70‑year‑old. Prevention\n\nLifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis and increases bone density. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence that the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk of having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1 g of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there does not appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures. While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death, an increased risk of myocardial infarctions  kidney stones, and stomach problems is associated with calcium supplementation,\n\nVitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. Physical exercise \nThere is limited evidence indicating that exercise is helpful in promoting bone health. There is some evidence that physical exercise may be beneficial for bone density in postmenopausal women and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Neither contribute to slowing bone loss with age, and professional bicycle racing has a negative effect on bone density. Low-quality evidence suggests that exercise may improve pain and quality of life of people with vertebral fractures and there is moderate-quality evidence that exercise will likely improve physical performance in individuals with vertebral fractures. Physical therapy \nPeople with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. There are conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, therefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on drugs. Management\n\nLifestyle\nWeight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Medications \n\nBisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis. This benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. With evidence of little benefit when used for more than three to five years and in light of the potential adverse events, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. For those with osteoporosis but who have not had a fracture, evidence does not support a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. There is tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis. Fluoride supplementation does not appear to be effective in postmenopausal osteoporosis, as even though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risk of fractures. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, there is not clear evidence of benefit in males. Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, and strontium ranelate can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Prognosis\n\nAlthough people with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, the fracture itself is rarely lethal. Fractures\nHip fractures are responsible for the most serious consequences of osteoporosis. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women. These are often overlooked as signs of osteoporosis, as these men are often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physical activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing. Epidemiology\n\nIt is estimated that 200 million people have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. Postmenopausal women have a higher rate of osteoporosis and fractures than older men. Postmenopausal women have decreased estrogen which contributes to their higher rates of osteoporosis. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture. It has been shown that latitude affects risk of osteoporotic fracture. There is also an association between Celiac Disease and increased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had osteoporosis. This places a large economic burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to osteoporosis, and the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually for related healthcare costs. History\nThe link between age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. French pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term osteoporosis. \"It follows that the skeletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labor in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition\", causing the osteoporosis seen when radiographs of the remains were made.

Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. Signs and symptoms\n\nOsteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. The term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Risk factors\n\nRisk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable\n\n The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable\n Excessive alcohol: Although small amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not been conclusively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis   A meta-analysis of published medical studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show significant improvement with other bones. Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people. Low-level exposure to cadmium is associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased risk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomalacia (softening of the bone). Medical disorders\n\nMany diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechanism influencing the bone metabolism is straightforward, whereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown. For example, localized osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured limb in a cast. Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis.

Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Newer fluorescent lights without magnetic ballasts have essentially eliminated flicker. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. Ultraviolet radiation risk\n\nSome fluorescent lamps emit ultraviolet radiation. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Not all open CFLs produce significant UV emissions. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom recommend that in situations requiring close proximity to the light source, open (single envelope) CFLs be replaced with encapsulated (double envelope) CFLs. In 2009, Natural Resources Canada released a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. At 30 cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. SCENIHR study and report\nThe Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:\nUltraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. Melanoma has been shown to not be affected by CFLs through normal use. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Mercury\nFluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb. Several countries have specialised recycling or disposal systems for fluorescent bulbs, e.g. The U.S. EPA states that using energy-efficient CFLs reduces demand for power, which reduces the amount of coal burned by power plants and hence reduces the amount of mercury emitted from coal fired power plants. Other conditions associated with fluorescent light\nIn rare cases individuals with solar urticaria (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting, although this is true of any source of light. Standard acrylic diffusers over the fluorescent lamps absorb nearly all the UV-B radiation and appear to protect against this. The charity Migraine Action Association reported concerns from members that CFL bulbs can cause migraines, and there are many anecdotal reports of such occurrences. References\n\nToxic effects of substances chiefly nonmedicinal as to source\nGas discharge lamps\n\nFluorescent lamps have been suggested to affect human health in various ways.

In 2009, Natural Resources Canada released a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps.

The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000.\" evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern.\" This raised the average health of Black babies. Secondly, this paper expressed the importance of taking time off work in order to commit to prenatal care as the results show the behavioural change of pregnant women in times of unemployment. He was found to be profoundly hypokalaemic with a serum potassium level of 1.4 mmol ⁄ l. He had been drinking 4l of Coca-Cola per day over the past 3 years, and drank up to 10l to slake his thirst when he went for kangaroo-shooting at night. He was advised to curtail his cola drinking, and his potassium level normalised, his weakness resolved, and he made a full recovery (1). I asked him how much he drank, and he said that he sipped it continuously, 4l per day. He was not willing to stop drinking cola, but he did agree to reduce his intake to 2l per day. Sugar sweetened soft drinks have been shown to cause obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental decay and metabolic syndrome. They appear also to increase the risk for osteoporosis, gout, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, hypovitaminosis C, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The only therapeutic use of soft drinks is described in a few case reports of the successful use of Coca-Cola to dissolve phytobezoars. In their review of cola-induced hypokalaemia, Tsimihodimos et al. make a compelling argument that potassium depletion should be added to the long list of soft drink-related health problems. In the cases they describe, chronic consumption of 3–10l of sugar-sweetened cola per day led to severe hypokalaemia, hypokalaemic myopathy, and in some cases, hypokalaemic paralysis. One patient developed hypokalaemic nephropathy and subsequent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In all cases, the patients’ symptoms improved, and the hypokalaemia resolved with potassium repletion and reduction or cessation of cola drinking. Second, drinks containing large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup send boluses of largely indigestible fructose into the GI tract, which causes potassium wasting via an osmotic diarrhoea. Third, caffeine has been shown to cause beta adrenergic stimulation, increase Na+⁄K+-ATPase via cellular phosphodiesterase inhibition, and produce metabolic alkalosis, diuresis and increased renin levels, all of which may contribute to hypokalaemia. Based on case reports of hypokalaemia from both caffeine-free soft drinks and caffeine products (such as coffee and tea) without sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, any or all of the above mechanisms may be at work in various individuals drinking various beverages. However, soft drinks that combine large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup with caffeine, such as regular colas, might deplete potassium stores more effectively because of concurrent osmotic and caffeine-mediated potassium wasting. One might argue that people who drink 3–10l of cola per day are outliers, and that excessive soft drink consumption at this level is so rare that it is not a public health issue. Consider, too, the marketing of the soft drink. With aggressive mass marketing, super-sizing of soft drinks, and the effects of caffeine tolerance and dependence, there is very little doubt that tens of millions of people in industrialised countries drink at least 2–3l of cola per day. As our heavy cola drinkers age and develop obesity, hypertension and diabetes, they will become more vulnerable to the potentially lethal effects of chronic hypokalaemia. Another concern is that even moderate chronic cola consumption has been found to be associated with CKD. A comparison of 465 patients with newly diagnosed CKD and 467 community controls in North Carolina showed a twofold increased risk of CKD in patients who drank two or more cola drinks (16 ounces) per day (9). Most government responses to soft drink health concerns have focused on protecting children from youth-targeted advertising and in school vending machines. This same focus seems to hold in the medical profession, where paediatricians are generally more aware of the health risks of soft drinks, and probably more likely than internists to discuss them with their patients. In addition to the usual questions about alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use, internists need to start asking their adult patients about soft drink consumption. Cola drinks need to be added to the physician’s checklist of drugs and substances (such as liquorice) that can cause hypokalaemia. More work is needed on the epidemiology of cola consumption, hypokalaemia and cardiovascular disease rates. Ann Intern Med 1986; 105: 468.\nstudy. Arch Intern Med 2002; 162: 1007–12.

On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order to implement the recommendations proposed in a report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&D of new antibiotics. Among the proposals: Scientists have started using advanced computational approaches with supercomputers for the development of new antibiotic derivatives to deal with antimicrobial resistance. • Lefamulin: pleuromutilin antibiotic. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. In the US, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat \n\n growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\" FDA approved on 19 December 2014. • Ceftaroline/avibactam (CPT-avibactam; ceftaroline/NXL104): Anti-MRSA cephalosporin/ β-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor).

In the longer term (13–24 months), this review is very uncertain about the positive and negative effects of PAE in comparison with transurethral resection surgery. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. The underlying mechanism involves the prostate pressing on the urethra thereby making it difficult to pass urine out of the bladder. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, a number of procedures, and surgery. In those with more significant symptoms, medications may include alpha blockers such as terazosin or 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride. Surgical removal of part of the prostate may be carried out in those who do not improve with other measures. Although prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated in males with BPH, the condition does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms. One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate. While there is some evidence that estrogen may play a role in the cause of BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. In canine in vivo studies castration, which significantly reduced androgen levels but left estrogen levels unchanged, caused significant atrophy of the prostate. Studies looking for a correlation between prostatic hyperplasia and serum estrogen levels in humans have generally shown none. If confirmed, this mechanism explains why serum androgen levels do not seem to correlate with BPH and why giving exogenous testosterone would not make much difference. Men older than 60 in rural areas had very low rates of clinical BPH, while men living in cities and consuming more animal protein had a higher incidence. In a large prospective cohort study in the US (the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), investigators reported modest associations between BPH (men with strong symptoms of BPH or surgically confirmed BPH) and total energy and protein, but not fat intake. Degeneration \nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is an age-related disease. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that development of benign prostatic hyperplasia is a consequence of fibrosis and weakening of the muscular tissue in the prostate. Pathophysiology \n\nAs men age, the enzymes aromatase and 5-alpha reductase increase in activity. (Carcinoma of the prostate typically occurs in the posterior lobe – hence the ability to discern an irregular outline per rectal examination). :694 In BPH, the majority of growth occurs in the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate. This condition has been defined as giant prostatic hyperplasia (GPH). The degree of LUTS does not necessarily correspond to the size of the prostate. However, if the prostate gland feels asymmetrical, firm, or nodular, this raises concern for prostate cancer. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer. Validated questionnaires such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), and more recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia) are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms. Differential diagnosis\n\nMedical conditions \nThe differential diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, and other diseases of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Alpha-adrenergic agonist medications, such as decongestants with pseudoephedrine can increase bladder outlet resistance. In contrast, calcium channel blockers and anticholinergic medications can worsen urinary retention by promoting bladder muscle relaxation. Management \nWhen treating and managing benign prostatic hyperplasia, the aim is to prevent complications related to the disease and improve or relieve symptoms. Approaches used include lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery. Physical activity \nPhysical activity has been recommended as a treatment for urinary tract symptoms. However, the quality of evidence was very low and therefore it remains uncertain whether physical activity is helpful in men experiencing urinary symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. Alpha blockers \nSelective α1-blockers are the most common choice for initial therapy. They have a small to moderate benefit at improving symptoms. Selective alpha-1 blockers are similar in effectiveness but have slightly different side effect profiles. Alpha blockers relax smooth muscle in the prostate and the bladder neck, thus decreasing the blockage of urine flow. For men with LUTS due to an enlarged prostate, the effects of naftopidil, tamsulosin and silodosin on urinary symptoms and quality of life may be similar. Tamsulosin and silodosin are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in the prostate instead of the α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. 5α-Reductase inhibitors \n\nThe 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride may also be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer-term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in people with more severe symptoms and larger prostates. These drugs may improve urinary symptoms slightly and reduce urinary bother but may also cause more side effects compared to placebo. PDE also likely improves symptoms when used in combination with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Several phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are also effective, but may require multiple doses daily to maintain adequate urine flow. Others \n\nAntimuscarinics such as tolterodine may also be used, especially in combination with alpha blockers. Self-catheterization \n\nIntermittent urinary catheterization is used to relieve the bladder in people with urinary retention. Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when it is difficult or impossible to completely empty the bladder. Urinary tract infection is the most common complication of intermittent catheterization. Surgical techniques used include the following:\n Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the gold standard. TURP is thought to be the most effective approach for improving urinary symptoms and urinary flow, however, this surgical procedure may be associated with complications in up to 20% of men. Surgery carries some risk of complications, such as retrograde ejaculation (most commonly), erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, urethral strictures. Other less invasive surgical approaches (requiring spinal anesthesia) include:\n Holmium Laser Ablation of the Prostate (HoLAP)\n Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLeP)\n Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP). Minimally invasive procedures \nSome less invasive procedures are available according to patients' preferences and co-morbidities. These are performed as outpatient procedures with local anesthesia. Through catheters, embolic agents are released in the main branches of the prostatic artery, in order to induce a decrease in the size of the prostate gland, thus reducing the urinary symptoms. Water vapor thermal therapy (marketed as Rezum): This is a newer office procedure for removing prostate tissue using steam aimed at preserving sexual function. Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) is an outpatient procedure that is less invasive compared to surgery and involves using microwaves (heat) to shrink prostate tissue that is enlarged. Temporary implantable nitinol device (TIND and iTIND): is a device that is placed in the urethra that, when released, is expanded, reshaping the urethra and the bladder neck. Particularly, several systematic reviews found that Saw palmetto extract from Serenoa repens, while one of the most commonly used, is no better than placebo in both symptom relief and decreasing prostate size.

The underlying mechanism involves the prostate pressing on the urethra thereby making it difficult to pass urine out of the bladder. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, a number of procedures, and surgery. In those with more significant symptoms, medications may include alpha blockers such as terazosin or 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride. Surgical removal of part of the prostate may be carried out in those who do not improve with other measures. Although prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated in males with BPH, the condition does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms. One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate. While there is some evidence that estrogen may play a role in the cause of BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. In canine in vivo studies castration, which significantly reduced androgen levels but left estrogen levels unchanged, caused significant atrophy of the prostate. Studies looking for a correlation between prostatic hyperplasia and serum estrogen levels in humans have generally shown none. If confirmed, this mechanism explains why serum androgen levels do not seem to correlate with BPH and why giving exogenous testosterone would not make much difference. Men older than 60 in rural areas had very low rates of clinical BPH, while men living in cities and consuming more animal protein had a higher incidence. In a large prospective cohort study in the US (the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), investigators reported modest associations between BPH (men with strong symptoms of BPH or surgically confirmed BPH) and total energy and protein, but not fat intake. Degeneration \nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is an age-related disease. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that development of benign prostatic hyperplasia is a consequence of fibrosis and weakening of the muscular tissue in the prostate. Pathophysiology \n\nAs men age, the enzymes aromatase and 5-alpha reductase increase in activity. (Carcinoma of the prostate typically occurs in the posterior lobe – hence the ability to discern an irregular outline per rectal examination). :694 In BPH, the majority of growth occurs in the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate. This condition has been defined as giant prostatic hyperplasia (GPH). The degree of LUTS does not necessarily correspond to the size of the prostate. However, if the prostate gland feels asymmetrical, firm, or nodular, this raises concern for prostate cancer. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer. Validated questionnaires such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), and more recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia) are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms. Differential diagnosis\n\nMedical conditions \nThe differential diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, and other diseases of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Alpha-adrenergic agonist medications, such as decongestants with pseudoephedrine can increase bladder outlet resistance. In contrast, calcium channel blockers and anticholinergic medications can worsen urinary retention by promoting bladder muscle relaxation. Management \nWhen treating and managing benign prostatic hyperplasia, the aim is to prevent complications related to the disease and improve or relieve symptoms. Approaches used include lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery. Physical activity \nPhysical activity has been recommended as a treatment for urinary tract symptoms. However, the quality of evidence was very low and therefore it remains uncertain whether physical activity is helpful in men experiencing urinary symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. Alpha blockers \nSelective α1-blockers are the most common choice for initial therapy. They have a small to moderate benefit at improving symptoms. Selective alpha-1 blockers are similar in effectiveness but have slightly different side effect profiles. Alpha blockers relax smooth muscle in the prostate and the bladder neck, thus decreasing the blockage of urine flow. For men with LUTS due to an enlarged prostate, the effects of naftopidil, tamsulosin and silodosin on urinary symptoms and quality of life may be similar. Tamsulosin and silodosin are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in the prostate instead of the α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. 5α-Reductase inhibitors \n\nThe 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride may also be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer-term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in people with more severe symptoms and larger prostates.

If the symptoms cause a significant disruption to quality of life, a man may undergo initial treatment by oral medication, such as alpha-1 receptor blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, or phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitors. Those with severe/progressive symptoms or those who do not experience symptom relief from medication have traditionally been considered for surgical intervention, with transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP as the standard of care. However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It was last used in 1944. In September 2020, Monash University Professor of Diabetes Paul Zimmet claimed that the switch to daylight saving time caused an increase in heart attacks, road accidents, workplace accidents, and cognitive dysfunction, and could amplify the health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews responded that daylight saving would be part of the forthcoming summer season. Daylight saving was widely believed to be introduced as a consumer spending initiative by local councils and tourism boards throughout New South Wales. Multiple studies show a dose-response relationship between sedentary time and all-cause mortality with an increase of 3% mortality per additional sedentary hour each day. A study of the life habits of 276 subjects over a 6-year period and found that about 20% of those with long (9+ hours) of sleeping time developed type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance as compared to 7% in those that slept an average amount of time. A U-shaped relationship between hours of sleep and type 2 \n\n his claim, and Walker subsequently conceded that his assertion had been \"misremembered\", and was actually attributable to a claim from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014. Walker failed to disclose that numerous meta-analyses involving over 4 million adults found the lowest mortality was associated with 7 hours of sleep, and that the increased risk of death associated with sleeping more than 7 hours was significantly greater than the risk of sleeping less than 7 hours as defined by a J-shaped curve. Psychologist Stuart J. Ritchie criticised Walker's approach in his book. \"Walker could have written a far more cautious book that limited itself to just what the data shows, but perhaps such a book wouldn’t \n\nA new study conducted by a team of scientists led by Giles Duffield, assistant professor of biological sciences and a member of the Eck Institute for Global Health at the University of Notre Dame, focuses on the circadian clock of the heart, using cultured heart tissue. Previous studies by a research group at the University of Geneva demonstrated a role for glucocorticoids in shifting the biological clock, and characterized this effect in the liver. The researchers determined the temporal state of the circadian clock by monitoring the rhythmic expression of clock genes period 1 and period 2 in living tissues derived from transgenic mice. For example, at some point in the time zone transition, your brain might be in the time zone of Sydney, Australia; your heart in Hawaii; and your liver still in Los Angeles. It is important to note that approximately 16 percent of the U.S. and European workforces undertake some form of shift work. Further, this response is likely to be time-of-day specific, and the phase response curve to medium treatment that the authors generated in vitro would also predict at what time of the 24-hour day such shifts might occur. The work was funded by grants from the American Heart Association and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

A new global guideline on chronic urticaria (CU) recommends Xolair® (omalizumab), indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), for patients who are not responding to antihistamines,. Xolair is the only licensed treatment option for CSU, a type of CU, for patients unresponsive to antihistamines. The guideline recommends Xolair as the only treatment qualified with very good efficacy and very good safety in CSU. Marcus Maurer, MD, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy and Director of Research at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany said: \"I highly welcome the new guideline, as it brings greater public awareness of the disease and treatment. \"This guideline is encouraging news for CSU patients who have difficult to control symptoms,\" said Shreeram Aradhye MD, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \"The recommendation reinforces the important role of Xolair to provide effective symptom control in CSU when antihistamines prove inadequate. Xolair is the only biologic shown to be effective in CSU.\" Patients treated with Xolair for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements in quality of life by 78% (vs placebo 44%, p<0.0001) as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In addition, data show that almost 90% of CSU patients who responded well to initial Xolair treatment regained symptom control within 12 weeks of Xolair retreatment following a treatment interruption, based on Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) criteria (UAS7<=6). Also, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma. Xolair is a targeted therapy that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE). In allergic diseases and asthma, the binding of IgE by Xolair reduces symptoms by suppressing multiple cell activation mechanisms, including some that result in histamine release. Research is ongoing to better understand the mechanism of action of Xolair in CSU, which could lead to a deeper understanding of how the disease develops. Xolair is approved for the treatment of CSU in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005 and has over 800,000 patient years of exposure. In the US, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Novartis is a global leader in Immunology & Dermatology. Other key brands include Xolair® (omalizumab) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), Zortress®/Certican® (everolimus) and Myfortic® (mycophenolic acid) in transplant and Ilaris® (canakinumab), approved to treat several rare diseases including some Periodic Fever Syndromes.

Xolair is the First Biologic Medicine Approved for CIU, a Burdensome Skin Condition that Can Cause Hives and Severe Itch and May Last Many Years. Nearly 50 Percent of Patients Have Inadequate Response to H1-antihistamines, Previously the Only Approved Therapy for CIU3. Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xolair(R) (omalizumab) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a form of chronic hives. The new use is for people 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Until now, H(1) -antihistamines have been the only approved therapy for CIU, with about 50 percent of patients having an inadequate response(3) . Xolair is the first biologic medicine and first medicine approved by the FDA for CIU since non-sedating H(1) -antihistamines. Xolair is approved for people 12 years and older with CIU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Xolair is not used to treat other forms of urticaria (hives) and is not for use in children less than 12 years of age. It is jointly developed by Genentech and Novartis Pharma AG and is co-promoted in the U.S. with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The efficacy and safety profile of Xolair for the treatment of CIU was evaluated in two clinical studies called ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II(5) . In these studies, patients 12 to 75 years old received doses of Xolair at 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo(5) . Xolair or placebo was given every four weeks for 24 weeks (ASTERIA I) and 12 weeks (ASTERIA II). In addition, patients continued to receive H(1) -antihistamine medicines they had been taking for CIU before starting treatment with Xolair(5) . The efficacy of Xolair in patients 12 years and older who remained symptomatic despite taking H(1) -antihistamines was assessed using a scale known as the average (mean) weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS) at Week 12. In ASTERIA I, Xolair 150 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 47 percent (-6.7) and Xolair 300 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 66 percent (-9.4) at Week 12, compared to a 25 percent (-3.6) score improvement for patients who received placebo(5) . Also, a larger proportion of patients (36 percent) treated with Xolair 300 mg reported no itch and no hives at Week 12, compared to patients treated with Xolair 150 mg (15 percent), and patients in the placebo group (9 percent)(5) . The most common side effects in patients treated with Xolair were nausea, headaches, swelling of the inside of the nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper respiratory tract infection(5) . moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma who have had a skin or blood test that is positive for allergic asthma and whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma medicines called inhaled corticosteroids. chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; chronic hives without a known cause) who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1-antihistamine treatment. Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of urticaria (hives), acute bronchospasm (serious and sudden breathing problems) or status asthmaticus (acute, severe, prolonged asthma attack that can be life threatening).

It is aimed at stimulating resistance to respiratory syncytial virus infection, targeting both adult and infant populations. 2016 saw the company's first phase III trial, the 12,000 adult Resolve trial, for its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, which would come to be known as ResVax, fail in September. Evaluation of \n\nA drug already used to treat moderate-to-severe allergic asthma appears to offer relief to people with chronic hives who haven't been helped by standard medications, new research suggests. The prescription drug -- omalizumab (Xolair) -- is already available to treat hives, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year for that use. \"And until now antihistamines have been the only approved drug for chronic hives. But to work, antihistamines often need to be used at up to four times approved levels, which has a sedating effect. So then we would turn to the heavy artillery, like [the immunosuppressant drug] cyclosporine, which also has very severe side effects, and can't be taken by people with high blood pressure or heart disease.\" \"All this means that many, many patients have simply been left without any treatment,\" she noted. \"But with this drug we are seeing great improvement in patients who previously had no options. The current study is the latest in a series of ongoing studies, which are being funded by drug manufacturer Genentech Inc. and Novartis Pharma AG in Basel Switzerland. The team found that by the 12th week, people given Xolair showed a marked reduction in their overall number of hives, hive intensity and itching severity, compared with patients who got the dummy treatment. Symptom relief was maintained through the six-month mark, and the authors determined that those treated with the highest (300 mg) dosage of Xolair saw the biggest improvement.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While multiple pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions exist, careful selection of therapy is paramount as some medications can exacerbate seizures. With the recent approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome, providers and patients have an additional therapeutic option to consider. Within this context, pharmacists have a vital role in educating providers, caregivers, and patients on medication therapy. Cannabis has been used for over 4,000 years with varied success to treat ailments including chronic pain, eating disorders, rheumatism, and convulsions. In the 19th century, neurologists noted the potential effectiveness of cannabis for treating seizure disorders.34 Research since has continued to evaluate cannabis as a treatment option for epilepsy. Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials found significant improvement of seizure control when patients were treated with CBD in addition to their standard epilepsy treatment. Children and adults with DS and refractory seizures receiving CBD (20 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks exhibited a 52% reduction in seizure frequency compared to a modest 5% reduction with placebo (P = .01).38 In fact, 5% of these patients in the treatment group were seizure-free (P = .08).38 Similarly, in another study, addition of CBD (20 mg/kg) in patients with LGS and other refractory seizures resulted in a 43.9% median reduction of drop seizures in comparison with a 21.8% reduction with placebo addition.39 A third trial evaluating CBD in patients on standard epilepsy treatment showed 41.9% and 37.2% reduction in drop seizure frequencies over a 14-week treatment period with doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg twice a day, respectively, compared with 17.2% in the placebo group. In these studies, adverse effects noted included decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and abnormal liver-function tests.38-40 Drug interactions that may require monitoring and dose adjustment included valproic acid and clobazam.38-40 These results highlight the potential of cannabidiol as an adjunctive treatment for DS, LGS, and other refractory seizures. Patients with refractory seizures such as DS and LGS are at an increased risk for medication errors for reasons including complex medication regimens and increased transitions of care.43 As pharmacotherapy experts, pharmacists can play a major role in ensuring safe and effective therapy for patients by educating providers on appropriate medication choices and doses; evaluating patients’ medication regimen for contraindications, drug interactions, and adverse effects; ensuring that medication reconciliation is conducted carefully; and accurately providing education and counseling on medication therapy to patients and family members.

Some of these adults and parents, as well as medical researchers and physicians, are finding new hope in the use of cannabidiol, or CBD, for reducing the frequency and severity of seizures. CBD is a cannabinoid molecule produced by cannabis. Unlike THC, which is the most common cannabinoid, CBD is non-intoxicating. It also has significant pain relief, anti-inflammatory, and anti-anxiety properties, which offer a wide range of possible medicinal applications. CBD is usually administered orally in oil form to control seizures and can be given as drops under the tongue or mixed with food. Medical cannabis, a type of marijuana that contains both THC and CBD, has been used successfully to control seizures. Several states have approved the use of medical marijuana for epilepsy, but research is showing that CBD may be more effective than THC at reducing seizure activity. Some types of medical marijuana are low-THC and high-CBD, meaning that they have less of the intoxicating component that causes a “high” and more potentially beneficial CBD. More research is needed to understand exactly how CBD affects the brain, but researchers believe that CBD may control seizures by calming the brain’s abnormal electrical activity and chemical processes. Animal studies have shown that CBD has an anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effect, which means that it shows promise as a preventative treatment for epilepsy in humans. Although research into the possible applications of CBD for epilepsy treatment is encouraging and ongoing, some parents of children who have epilepsy are not waiting for further research results. Many parents with children who have severe, uncontrolled epilepsy are giving their children CBD now — and some are reporting life-changing results. Scientific researchers have conducted several controlled studies on CBD, meaning that study participants were divided into two or more groups for comparison. One group received a placebo (or a harmless substance that has no therapeutic effect), and the other group received the medication. An open-label study of an oral CBD solution found that of the median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 35.6 percent during the 12-week study. A double-blind, placebo-controlled 14-week trial of 120 children with Dravet syndrome showed that, on average, the frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from 12.4 per month to 5.9 per month after CBD treatment. Five percent of patients became seizure-free after using CBD, while none became seizure-free after using the placebo. The first trial, which included 171 patients, found that patients treated with CBD experienced a 44-percent average reduction of drop seizures. The second trial divided participants into two different dosage groups for CBD, as well as one placebo group. The study found that both of the CBD groups experienced a significant reduction in the average monthly frequency of drop seizures. In a survey conducted in Mexico on 43 children with epilepsy, 81.3 percent of parents whose children used CBD reported a decrease in convulsions. Not only are parents reporting a reduction in their children’s seizures after CBD therapy, but they also are reporting a better quality of life, including improved social interactions, memory, behavior, and energy. Another survey of the parents of 19 children who were using CBD-enriched cannabis, 16 parents (84 percent) reported a reduction in their child’s seizure frequency. As research into CBD for epilepsy treatment continues, studies will look at exactly how CBD impacts the brain. Researchers also will try to determine effective dosing and strength guidelines for epilepsy treatment using CBD and will look at whether CBD interacts with other anti-seizure medications. But, for people with uncontrolled epilepsy who are out of treatment options, CBD may offer a way to control seizures — as well as a chance at an improved quality of life. TEA responds well to low doses of medicine used to treat epilepsy, (such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine or sodium valproate) resulting in a cessation of seizure activity in 45 of 47 patients. Medicated patients with continuing seizures experienced them less frequently. In 2015, GW Pharmaceutical initiated Phase 3 clinical trials of cannabidiol oral solution for treatment of two rare disease in children – Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. In August 2015, GW received FDA Fast Track Development Program designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for use of the drug candidate to treat newborns with epilepsy. The drug, under the brand name Epidiolex, was given US Food and Drug Administration approval in June 2018. It was subsequently given European EMA approval in September 2019 under the brand name Epidyolex. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved a drug called Epidiolex which contains cannabidiol (CBD). The preparation in form of strawberry syrup will be used in the treatment of patients with epileptic syndromes (dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) between 2 years old and older. “This is an important advancement in the treatment of children’s epilepsy,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Scott Gottlieb on Monday. “Due to the efficacy and safety of the use of Epidiolex confirmed in clinical trials in patients, an official agreement was finally approved on the possibility of using this drug in the treatment of certain types of epilepsy,” adds Gottlieb. On the website of the producer, a biopharmaceutical company GW Pharmaceuticals dealing with the discovery, development, and commercialization of new drugs, Epidiolex is the first (available by medical prescription) pharmaceutical formulation containing a high content of purified cannabidiol (CBD) of plant origin that does not cause intoxicating. “The approval of Epidiolex is a milestone in the use of a cannabidiol for the treatment of neurological disorders. This is the first and so far the only CBD drug that can be used to treat two types of epilepsy in children. We would like to say that we have high hopes for the introduction of Epidiolex for medical treatment, “ said Justin Gover, CEO of GW. “The FDA approval of our drug is the culmination of the long-term cooperation of GW Pharmaceuticals with patients, their families, and doctors to develop a new preparation that would be helpful in the fight against epilepsy. Patients deserve it and soon will have access to a CBD-containing drug that has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials, meets all the pharmaceutical product quality criteria and will be available as a prescription from a doctor “ – Justin Gover. “In my medical practice, I had many patients who suffered from drug-resistant epilepsy. In such patients, the treatment regimens used so far most often did not bring the expected results, which is why these patients often asked about the possibility of using CBD “ – said Dr. Orrin Devinsky of the Epileptic Treatment Center at NYU Langone Health, and also one of the main clinical trial managers of Epidiolex. Elizabeth Thiele, director of the pediatric clinic at the General Hospital in Massachusetts, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief scientist in clinical trials with the drug Epidiolex mentions that the Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet teams are two of the most difficult to control forms of pediatric epilepsy. “These children and their families face a long and difficult path, and very few achieve adequate seizure control. This drug supplements a specific pharmacological gap dedicated to a specific population of pediatric patients and is now the first that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The clinical trial program for Epidiolex included three randomized, double-blind clinical trials and an open-label extension study. From articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet scientific journals, it appears that the addition of Epidiolex to other anti-epileptic therapies has resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) reported the identification of a novel coronavirus (later identified as the SARS-CoV-2) as the cause. The disease in China affected over 80,000 people, causing over 3,200 deaths (as of March 25, 2020) and has now spread to over 210 countries and territories across the world. A 62-year-old man from Italy entered the country on 22 February and fell ill on 24 February, when he was transferred to Ramón Lara military hospital from the beach resort of Bayahibe. On 6 March, the second case in the country was confirmed as a Canadian tourist (also vacationing in Bayahibe) was detected. Local transmission\n\nThe first documented case of local transmission seems to have originated from a 56-year old Dominican woman from the town of Villa Riva on Duarte Province who had traveled from Italy to the Dominican Republic on 26 February 2020. The woman refused to be sent to Santo Domingo to be in isolation after receiving her COVID-19 positive diagnosis, returning to her home instead. Costa Favolosa cruise ship\nTwenty Dominican doctors were exposed to the virus while celebrating their 30-year medical school graduation anniversary on board the Costa Favolosa cruise ship around the Caribbean. They started the journey on March 2, and before landing  on 9 March, at least five in the Dominican party presented COVID-19 symptoms, and later tested as positive for the virus. Recoveries\nOn 23 March, the Minister of Public Health reported two recoveries, a 12-year-old child and a 26-year-old woman. #PlanDuarte  targeted SFM as the highest case and mortality city at that time. Within two weeks of implementing #PlanDuarte the province started showing evidence of a positive impact in reported positivity, critical care use and mortality in early May the focused and targeted approach to Duarte Province resulted in a statistically significant impact on Case Fatality Ratio for the whole country. On April 22, 2020, The first Dominican Epidemiology Intelligence Center was developed by the Presidential COVID-19 Committee under the leadership of Minister of Defense Lt General Paulino Sem, Counter Admiral Lee Balester and Doctor Amado Alejandro Baez. After the successful implementation of the C5i Epidemiology Intelligence Fusion Center, the Dominican Ministry of Public Health viewed this model as very important and effective and proceeded reproduced this effort four months later in August 2020, creating the MOH \"Center for Public Health Intelligence\" \nAfter the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 post the July 5th 2020 presidential elections, the DR experienced a peak in positivity on July 23, after which a continuous deceleration was noticed up to late September, this prompted a formal public congratulations by the World health Organization to the Dominican Government on Sept 24th 2020  the drastic improvements were noted on positivity rates, case fatality ratios and hospital capacity utilization, clearly this being evidence of all collective efforts of prior and current (August 16) authorities.

Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases which is maybe because the PCR test that was used is deffective. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. Two other samples in Pleven and Gabrovo were positive on 8 March. A 14-day preventive house quarantine was introduced for citizens who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or have returned from an overseas region with a high number of cases. For patients tested positive for the virus a 21-day house quarantine was introduced. This time span is counted from the day a subsequent test comes out negative after they have been treated in a hospital or at home. After the World Health Organization (WHO) has established that COVID-19 is more resilient than the initial data was showing, the National Crisis-management Staff increased the recovery house quarantine by a week to 28 days. Background \n\nA National Crisis-management Staff was formed by the Bulgarian government on 5 March to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. He is a stomach surgeon and epidemiology is not among his specialties. On 23 March a separate Medical Council for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic was appointed by the Prime Minister. Timeline\n\nMarch\n\n8 March \nOn 8 March 2020, Bulgaria confirmed its first two cases, a 27-year-old man from Pleven and a 75-year-old woman from Gabrovo. Neither of the two reported having traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. On the same day, the hospital in Gabrovo requested additional personnel from other hospitals in the country, as it only had three communicable diseases specialists. All of its internal medicine specialists have been quarantined after one of the four initial cases was confirmed to be a nurse at the hospital. The origin of the outbreak remains unknown, and the Ministry of Interior is tracking down all individuals who have been in contact with the patients. 10 March \n\nTwo additional cases were confirmed in Sofia on 10 March 2020: a 74-year-old man and his 66-year-old wife. Both have arrived from Lom two weeks prior to admission. 11 March \nA suspected case of a 33-year-old man was reported by the Saint George Hospital in Plovdiv on 11 March. The same day, a 40-year-old woman in Varna showed COVID-19 symptoms on CT scan, although regional health authorities have not yet confirmed the case. Many of these had been in contact with the elderly couple admitted to the Pirogov Hospital on 10 March. There were 13 breaches of quarantine; patients involved were returned to treatment facilities and warned of repercussions, including fines and prison sentences. 14 March \nOn 14 March, a second death and a third case in Pleven were reported. The second victim of the virus was the 74-year-old husband of the first victim. Late in the evening on 31 March a member of parliament was tested positive for the virus. A total of 83 tests were done at the Military Medical Academy, of which six were positive, and 51 were processed at the National Reference Laboratory, of which two were positive. In Varna, one test out of 12 samples proved positive. These are China, Iran, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Spain, Italy, South Korea, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The number of total cases rose to 62, including two British citizens vacationing in Bansko. 17 March \n81 cases were reported, several linked to an outbreak in Bansko. 18 March \nThe total number of cases increased to 94 by 18 March, with new cases appearing in Smolyan, Veliko Tarnovo and Pernik among recent arrivals from outside the country. The previous day, Bansko became the first town in the country to be put under quarantine. 19 March \nOn 19 March the cases rose to 105 and an 80-year-old woman, who recently had a stroke, died from COVID-19 on the same day, making her the third victim from the disease in Bulgaria. Elsewhere, a 78-year-old Bulgarian citizen died from COVID-19 while visiting family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The woman, a choir conductor in Sofia, was uninsured and refused to seek medical attention. Two cities, Dobrich and Shumen, confirmed their first cases, the latter related to the Bansko cluster. 24 March \nThe cases increased to 218 and the first case in Stara Zagora province was confirmed. A man from the town of Kazanlak was admitted in the Infectious unit in the hospital in Stara Zagora. 25 March \nThe number of cases increased to 242 by the end of the day, with the city of Sliven reporting its first confirmed case. 16 new cases with no relation between them were registered in Sofia, with some being medical staff from a local hospital. Two new cases were confirmed in Blagoevgrad, two in Plovdiv and one in Pleven. The coronavirus was registered for the first time in Kardzhali and Haskovo. 15 of the newly confirmed cases were in Sofia, 2 in Smolyan, one in Pleven, one in Veliko Tarnovo and one in Varna. Three soldiers were confirmed to be infected – two were stationed in Kosovo and were immediately brought back to Sofia, and the other contracted the virus in Romania, where he was hospitalized. The cases in Blagoevgrad, a mother and her daughter, were initially refused admission to the local hospital despite visible symptoms and had to request testing at a private lab; by the time the results came out as positive, the patients' condition had deteriorated significantly. They were eventually admitted and sent to intensive care, but both died shortly after. 29 March \nA total of 15 new cases were reported, with 8 in Sofia, 3 in Plovdiv, and one each in Kardzhali, Sliven, Smolyan and Varna. Three new recoveries were also announced, while the number of deaths rose to 8 after a 51-year-old woman died in the Blagoevgrad hospital, one day after her mother had succumbed to the virus. The total number of tests performed exceeded 7,000, with 276 done on 29 March alone. 31 March \nThe total number of confirmed infections increased by 40 to 399, and the first two cases were reported from the province of Silistra. 20 of the new cases were registered in Sofia, four each in Burgas and Kyustendil, three each in Plovdiv and Varna, two in Silistra, and one each in Kardzhali, Pernik, Shumen and Stara Zagora. From the total of 399 confirmed cases, just under 57% (227) were male, versus 43% (172) who were female. April\n\n1 April \nThe province of Ruse reported its first case as part of 23 new infections across the country, bringing the total to 422. In addition to Ruse, 10 new cases were reported in Sofia, two each in Blagoevgrad, Burgas, Dobrich and Plovdiv, and one each in Haskovo, Kardzhali, Sliven and Stara Zagora. Hassan Ademov from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms became the first Bulgarian member of parliament to contract the virus, forcing the announcement of a mass test on 2 April that would cover government staff and all 240 MPs. 2 April \nThe total number of infections increased by 35 to 457, with the first case being reported from the province of Vidin. No new deaths were reported, while the number of recoveries reached 25. The confirmed case count reached 487, after 28 new infections were registered – 18 in Sofia, two each in Plovdiv and Smolyan, and one each in Blagoevgrad, Burgas, Kardzhali, Kyustendil, Veliko Tarnovo and Vidin. 5 April \nThe Ministry of Health announced that the total number of COVID-19 tests had reached 15,899, with 8 laboratories performing the procedure across the country. 14 April\nThe village of Panicherovo in Stara Zagora Province was placed under quarantine, after a COVID–19 positive man escaped from a hospital where he was being treated and returned to the village. a 78-years old Briton whose sister was known to have been infected by the coronavirus and a Bulgarian repatriate from Varna) the Civil Aviation Authority put a ban on all flights between Britain and Bulgaria.

A 43-years-old female doctor from Sliven died after contracting the disease. 4 May\nDr Andrea Ammon, Director of ECDC, listed Bulgaria as the only country monitored by the Centre still seeing an increase in newly registered cases. 9 May\nTargovishte, the last Bulgarian province without any registered cases yet, had its first COVID-19 case confirmed. Organ transplantations are allowed again after a 2-month ban. Most of the anti-epidemic measures are still valid. The 14-day quarantine for everyone who enters the country remains. June 2021\nIn June 2021, genomic sequencing confirmed the presence of the Beta and Delta variants in Bulgaria. Iva Hristova, head of the Center for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, insisted that the presence of Omicron will need to be confirmed through genomic sequencing, for which the private laboratories do not possess the technology, with accurate findings expected to become available after the new year. Mathematician Ognyan Kunchev has stated that the sequencing process in Bulgaria takes around 10 days and needs to be sped up as well as cover more samples. On 29 December 2021, virologist Radka Argirova who serves as an advisor of Prime Minister Kiril Petkov stated that there are strong indications that Omicron is already in Bulgaria, referring to a number of suspected cases, all of them among people who had travelled abroad. January 2022\n\nVariant changes\nOn 2 January 2022, the first 12 cases of the Omicron variant were officially confirmed by the health authorities. 11 of them were in Sofia City Province while 1 was in Sofia Province, with 7 of the cases among non-vaccinated, 5 among vaccinated and none among people with a booster dose. Only one of the people infected with Omicron had recently been abroad. None of the infected required hospitalization. After the health authorities reported 9996 positive tests on 18 January 2022, on the next day the number of registered daily cases surpassed 10 000 for the first time, with 11 181 new infections announced for the previous 24 hours. On 26 January 2022, a new high of 12 399 official cases was reported by the Ministry of Health. It is indicative of the epidemic's evolution.

According to the latest Ministry of Health data, there were 2063 intensive care and 740 infectious disease hospital beds in the country, with a total of 1605 ventilators across the health system. However, Chief Health Inspector Angel Kunchev stated on 5 March that there is a shortage of medical personnel. Following the announcement of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, the Bulgarian government immediately banned the exports of protective equipment and placed orders for masks and protective suits to local manufacturers. In addition, 30,000 masks and 50,000 protective suits will be delivered by Turkey. Personnel in all hospitals was reportedly being screened for the disease, but in April a nurse in Vidin reported that she was refused a test after caring for a positive patient, as the hospital in the city had no testing kits. In an interview for Bulgarian National Television, Stoimenova had stated that the market for protective gear appears to be normalizing following the shortages the country experienced at the outbreak of the pandemic, but disruptions in the international pharmaceutical trade might lead to shortages of other medical supplies in Bulgaria. On 27 March, the Ministry of Health announced that the country now has the capacity to process between 1,000 and 1,200 tests per day, at an estimated cost of BGN 930,000 (EUR 475,000) per month. Major General Ventsislav Mutafchiyski called all three types \"equally important\", as the PCR ones provided reliable data, while the fluorescence tests could speed up the process before quick ones are applied to establish how many people have acquired immunity. Conversely, Prof. Radka Argirova, chairman of the National Expert Board in Virology at the Bulgarian Doctors' Union, urged increased rapid testing to discover asymptomatic cases, avoiding the chance of a future second peak and terminating the epidemic progression. \"Aggressive, complete screening\" of the population was also advocated by Dr. Rumen Hichev, a Bulgarian medical professional based in the United States and part of a medical advisor team to the White House. According to Hichev, the Bulgarian government had reacted quickly, but without mass screening to establish asymptomatic spreaders, any effort would be behind the course of events. The government announced that by 18 April, 26 417 tests had been performed. Medication \nAfter testing positive for COVID-19, business magnate Kiril Domuschiev announced that his company will procure chloroquine from foreign sources and donate it to the national coronavirus task force. Chloroquine, a quinine drug, has shown positive effects on COVID-19 patients in China and France. The Bulgarian government is looking into import opportunities from China and domestic production by local pharmaceutical companies. Exports of all quinine-based drugs were prohibited until further notice, and 35,000 doses of quinine-based Metamizole for export have been diverted for domestic consumption. Bulgarian biotechnology company Micar21 has been developing a general coronavirus vaccine in the past four years, and announced that it will begin clinical trials of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on this research in mid-2020. Criticism \nGeorgi Todorov, a Bulgarian doctor with experience in viral breakouts in Ghana, criticised the handling of the COVID-19 threat. In particular, Todorov stated that Bulgaria's health administration is so rife with nepotism that it cannot come up with any coherent response; as a result, infectious disease specialists were not taken into account when formulating response policies, and no specific locations were designated for potential COVID-19 cases. Todorov further assumed that infected individuals may have not been identified because of improper application of testing procedures. Other communities, from places like Yambol or Kyustendil, were sprayed with disinfectants from helicopters and crop dusters. Ognyan Isaev, a Roma activist, expressed concerns that if the pandemic worsened, discriminatory measures could be reinstated. Economy \nThe Bulgarian government has enacted a series of measures aimed at reducing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to businesses and individuals.

Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases which is maybe because the PCR test that was used is deffective. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. Two other samples in Pleven and Gabrovo were positive on 8 March. A 14-day preventive house quarantine was introduced for citizens who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or have returned from an overseas region with a high number of cases. For patients tested positive for the virus a 21-day house quarantine was introduced. This time span is counted from the day a subsequent test comes out negative after they have been treated in a hospital or at home. After the World Health Organization (WHO) has established that COVID-19 is more resilient than the initial data was showing, the National Crisis-management Staff increased the recovery house quarantine by a week to 28 days. Background \n\nA National Crisis-management Staff was formed by the Bulgarian government on 5 March to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. He is a stomach surgeon and epidemiology is not among his specialties. On 23 March a separate Medical Council for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic was appointed by the Prime Minister. Timeline\n\nMarch\n\n8 March \nOn 8 March 2020, Bulgaria confirmed its first two cases, a 27-year-old man from Pleven and a 75-year-old woman from Gabrovo. Neither of the two reported having traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. On the same day, the hospital in Gabrovo requested additional personnel from other hospitals in the country, as it only had three communicable diseases specialists. All of its internal medicine specialists have been quarantined after one of the four initial cases was confirmed to be a nurse at the hospital. The origin of the outbreak remains unknown, and the Ministry of Interior is tracking down all individuals who have been in contact with the patients. 10 March \n\nTwo additional cases were confirmed in Sofia on 10 March 2020: a 74-year-old man and his 66-year-old wife. Both have arrived from Lom two weeks prior to admission. 11 March \nA suspected case of a 33-year-old man was reported by the Saint George Hospital in Plovdiv on 11 March. The same day, a 40-year-old woman in Varna showed COVID-19 symptoms on CT scan, although regional health authorities have not yet confirmed the case. Many of these had been in contact with the elderly couple admitted to the Pirogov Hospital on 10 March. There were 13 breaches of quarantine; patients involved were returned to treatment facilities and warned of repercussions, including fines and prison sentences. 14 March \nOn 14 March, a second death and a third case in Pleven were reported. The second victim of the virus was the 74-year-old husband of the first victim. Late in the evening on 31 March a member of parliament was tested positive for the virus. A total of 83 tests were done at the Military Medical Academy, of which six were positive, and 51 were processed at the National Reference Laboratory, of which two were positive. In Varna, one test out of 12 samples proved positive. These are China, Iran, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Spain, Italy, South Korea, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The number of total cases rose to 62, including two British citizens vacationing in Bansko. 17 March \n81 cases were reported, several linked to an outbreak in Bansko. 18 March \nThe total number of cases increased to 94 by 18 March, with new cases appearing in Smolyan, Veliko Tarnovo and Pernik among recent arrivals from outside the country. The previous day, Bansko became the first town in the country to be put under quarantine. 19 March \nOn 19 March the cases rose to 105 and an 80-year-old woman, who recently had a stroke, died from COVID-19 on the same day, making her the third victim from the disease in Bulgaria. Elsewhere, a 78-year-old Bulgarian citizen died from COVID-19 while visiting family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The woman, a choir conductor in Sofia, was uninsured and refused to seek medical attention. 21 March \nThe number of cases increased to 142 by noon, and three patients had recovered. Two cities, Dobrich and Shumen, confirmed their first cases, the latter related to the Bansko cluster. 24 March \nThe cases increased to 218 and the first case in Stara Zagora province was confirmed. A man from the town of Kazanlak was admitted in the Infectious unit in the hospital in Stara Zagora. 25 March \nThe number of cases increased to 242 by the end of the day, with the city of Sliven reporting its first confirmed case. 16 new cases with no relation between them were registered in Sofia, with some being medical staff from a local hospital. Two new cases were confirmed in Blagoevgrad, two in Plovdiv and one in Pleven. The coronavirus was registered for the first time in Kardzhali and Haskovo. 15 of the newly confirmed cases were in Sofia, 2 in Smolyan, one in Pleven, one in Veliko Tarnovo and one in Varna. Three soldiers were confirmed to be infected – two were stationed in Kosovo and were immediately brought back to Sofia, and the other contracted the virus in Romania, where he was hospitalized. The cases in Blagoevgrad, a mother and her daughter, were initially refused admission to the local hospital despite visible symptoms and had to request testing at a private lab; by the time the results came out as positive, the patients' condition had deteriorated significantly. They were eventually admitted and sent to intensive care, but both died shortly after. 29 March \nA total of 15 new cases were reported, with 8 in Sofia, 3 in Plovdiv, and one each in Kardzhali, Sliven, Smolyan and Varna. Three new recoveries were also announced, while the number of deaths rose to 8 after a 51-year-old woman died in the Blagoevgrad hospital, one day after her mother had succumbed to the virus. The total number of tests performed exceeded 7,000, with 276 done on 29 March alone. 31 March \nThe total number of confirmed infections increased by 40 to 399, and the first two cases were reported from the province of Silistra. 20 of the new cases were registered in Sofia, four each in Burgas and Kyustendil, three each in Plovdiv and Varna, two in Silistra, and one each in Kardzhali, Pernik, Shumen and Stara Zagora. From the total of 399 confirmed cases, just under 57% (227) were male, versus 43% (172) who were female. April\n\n1 April \nThe province of Ruse reported its first case as part of 23 new infections across the country, bringing the total to 422. In addition to Ruse, 10 new cases were reported in Sofia, two each in Blagoevgrad, Burgas, Dobrich and Plovdiv, and one each in Haskovo, Kardzhali, Sliven and Stara Zagora. Hassan Ademov from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms became the first Bulgarian member of parliament to contract the virus, forcing the announcement of a mass test on 2 April that would cover government staff and all 240 MPs. 2 April \nThe total number of infections increased by 35 to 457, with the first case being reported from the province of Vidin. No new deaths were reported, while the number of recoveries reached 25. The confirmed case count reached 487, after 28 new infections were registered – 18 in Sofia, two each in Plovdiv and Smolyan, and one each in Blagoevgrad, Burgas, Kardzhali, Kyustendil, Veliko Tarnovo and Vidin. 5 April \nThe Ministry of Health announced that the total number of COVID-19 tests had reached 15,899, with 8 laboratories performing the procedure across the country. 14 April\nThe village of Panicherovo in Stara Zagora Province was placed under quarantine, after a COVID–19 positive man escaped from a hospital where he was being treated and returned to the village. a 78-years old Briton whose sister was known to have been infected by the coronavirus and a Bulgarian repatriate from Varna) the Civil Aviation Authority put a ban on all flights between Britain and Bulgaria. The decree refers to the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in that country for the last weeks surpassing the level in other concerned countries. 20 April \nThe ministry of Health announced the renewal of planned surgeries and hospitalizations, immunizations, child and prenatal care. 2 May\nThe first case in the province of Razgrad was confirmed, meaning that now 27 out of 28 provinces have proven cases of COVID-19.

Background\nOn 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Wuhan, Hubei, China, informed the WHO about a cluster of acute pneumonia cases with unknown origin in its province. On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) reported the identification of a novel coronavirus (later identified as the SARS-CoV-2) as the cause. The disease in China affected over 80,000 people, causing over 3,200 deaths (as of March 25, 2020) and has now spread to over 210 countries and territories across the world. A 62-year-old man from Italy entered the country on 22 February and fell ill on 24 February, when he was transferred to Ramón Lara military hospital from the beach resort of Bayahibe. On 6 March, the second case in the country was confirmed as a Canadian tourist (also vacationing in Bayahibe) was detected. Local transmission\n\nThe first documented case of local transmission seems to have originated from a 56-year old Dominican woman from the town of Villa Riva on Duarte Province who had traveled from Italy to the Dominican Republic on 26 February 2020. The woman refused to be sent to Santo Domingo to be in isolation after receiving her COVID-19 positive diagnosis, returning to her home instead. Costa Favolosa cruise ship\nTwenty Dominican doctors were exposed to the virus while celebrating their 30-year medical school graduation anniversary on board the Costa Favolosa cruise ship around the Caribbean. They started the journey on March 2, and before landing  on 9 March, at least five in the Dominican party presented COVID-19 symptoms, and later tested as positive for the virus. Recoveries\nOn 23 March, the Minister of Public Health reported two recoveries, a 12-year-old child and a 26-year-old woman. #PlanDuarte  targeted SFM as the highest case and mortality city at that time. Within two weeks of implementing #PlanDuarte the province started showing evidence of a positive impact in reported positivity, critical care use and mortality in early May the focused and targeted approach to Duarte Province resulted in a statistically significant impact on Case Fatality Ratio for the whole country. On April 22, 2020, The first Dominican Epidemiology Intelligence Center was developed by the Presidential COVID-19 Committee under the leadership of Minister of Defense Lt General Paulino Sem, Counter Admiral Lee Balester and Doctor Amado Alejandro Baez. After the successful implementation of the C5i Epidemiology Intelligence Fusion Center, the Dominican Ministry of Public Health viewed this model as very important and effective and proceeded reproduced this effort four months later in August 2020, creating the MOH \"Center for Public Health Intelligence\" \nAfter the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 post the July 5th 2020 presidential elections, the DR experienced a peak in positivity on July 23, after which a continuous deceleration was noticed up to late September, this prompted a formal public congratulations by the World health Organization to the Dominican Government on Sept 24th 2020  the drastic improvements were noted on positivity rates, case fatality ratios and hospital capacity utilization, clearly this being evidence of all collective efforts of prior and current (August 16) authorities.

The first imported case in Cambodia was detected in Sihanoukville on 27 January 2020. Although a number of imported cases and transmission to direct contacts were confirmed throughout 2020, no community transmission was detected until 29 November 2020. As of July 2021, Phnom Penh has been the most affected province with the majority of infections and deaths. Banteay Meanchey has the second-highest number of infections, whereas Kandal has second-highest number of deaths. The public health response is led by the Ministry of Health with support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak. In November, some restrictions were reinstated in Phnom Penh and thousands of Cambodian government employees and contacts went into quarantine following a one day-visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who tested positive after arriving in Bangkok. On 29 November, the first community transmission cluster was detected in Phnom Penh, with the virus suspected to have entered the country sometime during October and circulated undetected. The country began its vaccination programme and detected its largest outbreak to date in February 2021 thought to be related to a Phnom Penh quarantine breach that led to outbreaks at nightlife venues. Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021. Cambodia's response up to July 2020 and its welcoming of the MS Westerdam were praised by the World Health Organization. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. on 27 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital. On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia.

Although a number of imported cases and transmission to direct contacts were confirmed throughout 2020, no community transmission was detected until 29 November 2020. As of July 2021, Phnom Penh has been the most affected province with the majority of infections and deaths. Banteay Meanchey has the second-highest number of infections, whereas Kandal has second-highest number of deaths. The public health response is led by the Ministry of Health with support from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak. Cambodia's initial response was slow - during the initial outbreak in China, few international travel restrictions were introduced, Cambodian citizens were not evacuated from Wuhan and Prime Minister Hun Sen downplayed the threat. In November, some restrictions were reinstated in Phnom Penh and thousands of Cambodian government employees and contacts went into quarantine following a one day-visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó, who tested positive after arriving in Bangkok. On 29 November, the first community transmission cluster was detected in Phnom Penh, with the virus suspected to have entered the country sometime during October and circulated undetected. The country began its vaccination programme and detected its largest outbreak to date in February 2021 thought to be related to a Phnom Penh quarantine breach that led to outbreaks at nightlife venues. Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021. Cambodia's response up to July 2020 and its welcoming of the MS Westerdam were praised by the World Health Organization. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. on 27 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital. On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia. The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine. The Westerdam arrived in Sihanoukville on 13 February after it had been turned away by four countries due to virus concerns. No officials or passengers implemented social distancing or mask wearing during the ceremony, and passengers were later encouraged to tour around Phnom Penh. Of 145 Westerdam passengers who stopped in Malaysia by plane on 15 February, an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected. By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were isolated and taken clinical tests, and still, the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize. 1-15 March 2020 - imported cases\nOn 7 March, the second case of the coronavirus was detected in a 38-year-old man, a Cambodian in Siem Reap. He was among four people (three of the man's relatives and a Japanese woman) placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital, all of whom had direct contact with a Japanese man in his 40s who left Cambodia on 3 February and tested positive upon arrival in his country at Chubu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname, Aichi. Meanwhile, some 40 other people in the same city had been isolated under medical supervision since indirect contacts with the same Japanese man. At 4:30p.m., a 65-year-old British woman had tested positive for the virus in Kampong Cham. Arriving to Phnom Penh on 7 March via the cruise, it was reported that a Vietnamese woman, who was seated next to the group on the plane from London, had carried the virus. Two of them refused, claiming that they were healthy and having no symptoms, until the cruise ship reached Kampong Cham on 9 March. Following the event, the boat had been docked to provide samples to be tested from all 29 other passengers and 34 crew and were they placed under quarantine in a hotel somewhere in the city. The British patient was transferred to Royal Phnom Penh Hospital in Phnom Penh at her own request, adding that she had been conducted with coordination from WHO. Due to their ages, the married couple were transferred to Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh. On 13 March, health officials confirmed two cases in Phnom Penh at 8p.m. A 49-year-old Canadian and a 33-year-old Belgian were in quarantine in Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital. For the time being, another two visitors to Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (A British and his friend, a Canadian woman who worked in China) were suspected to have the symptoms and admitted to the said hospital. The British man, however, made an escape but was found later in Kampot and hospitalized there. According to  a Ministry of Health press release, Cambodia announced a ban on all entries from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the United States, thereby all visas would be undeniably suspended. On 15 March, an additional case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Phnom Penh at 5p.m. To wait for the results, he wasn't allowed to go any further, however as a follow-up health checkup was presented, he was informed that he could carry on and the results would be available accordingly. It included a 4-month-old child of the French patient, a Cambodian from France, and two Khmer Muslims, 35 and 39, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat mosque superspreader event near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 29 February. The ten mosque event attendees arrived at Preah Vihear (except one, who arrived at Stung Treng) on 3 March and up to 14 March, Malaysia informed that it had found the infected from that gathering. Within the span of two days on 17 March, the total confirmed cases leapt to 33. 11 Khmer were found to be infected in various provinces. One case further referred to a Cambodian man who crossed the border from Thailand in Banteay Meanchey. At 9:00p.m., nine more cases were included, six more attendees in Malaysia and three Malaysians out of a group of five. Two of the group were put under quarantine at a mosque in Kep. On 18 March, four more cases were detected: two Malaysians in Kampot and two more tabligh attendees in Tboung Khmum. On 19 March, ten more cases were detected: two wives of the infected men, two more tabligh attendees, and six Malaysians. On 20 March, the Ministry of Health announced an additional 4 confirmed cases: a Malaysian, and three Cambodians, one of whom was infected from an attendee from Malaysia and had no recent travel record overseas. On 21 March, two more cases were confirmed at 9p.m., a 67-year-old and an 80-year-old Frenchmen who arrived Sihanoukville as tourists on 18 March. 37 people suspected to have contacts with were put under quarantine. At 10p.m., more 29 people linked in the same tourist group of the cases confirmed the previous night, plus two Cambodian guides were detected of the virus. The tourist group arrived Cambodia on 11 March, visiting four provinces. On 23 March at 19:30, three new cases were recorded to include a mother of a 4-month-old child whom she and her infant had been placed under treatment at the Kantha Bopha Children's Hospital and other two Cambodians. It also added that four patients, two from Tboung Khmum and another two from Battambang, were all tested negative twice and ready to be discharged. On 25 March, Cambodia recorded five new cases, two from the French tourist group and 3 Cambodians with no recent foreign travels. Four more patients, three from Phnom Penh and one from Tboung Khmum, had made complete recovery for that day. 174 Chinese nationals had been quarantined in Svay Rieng upon their arrival from Phnom Penh by bus after two of them exhibited high temperatures. The local authorities were ordered to pay close attention and getting them informed on preventive measures and self-quarantine themselves for two weeks. On 26–28 March, two Indonesians taking off from Thailand and a Cambodian family of four who went on a trip to France were added to confirmed cases. On 29–31 March, six cases were added to the total of 109 at the month's end. Eleven patients from Koh Kong, Banteay Meanchey, Phnom Penh, Kampong Chhnang, Battambang and Siem Reap was  reported to have recovered from the disease. The authorities had traced 340 people who had indirect contacts with infected French tourist group in Siem Reap. April 2020 - cancellation of Khmer New Year\nBetween 1 and 9 April, Cambodia counted 9 new cases, most notably on 9 April, a discharged patient was found to be relapsing two days after. Moreover, 48 patients reportedly had recovered, mostly in Sihanoukville, adding up to 68 in total. A planned return of 150 Cambodian workers from Malaysia was turn down on 7 April by the government to tighten safety for its country. May–October 2020 - slowdown in new case detections and reopenings\nAfter a month-long streak of no new cases in May, the Ministry of Health reported a new imported case of a man travelling from the Philippines. The other 62 passengers on the flight are quarantined at a hotel in Phnom Penh. Szijjártó tested positive upon his return to Bangkok the following day, prompting staff from 13 government institutions, including Prime Minister Hun Sen, to go into quarantine. As of 11 November, the Ministry of Health had tested over 1,000 contacts and had started contact tracing efforts into seven provinces, with four contacts testing positive. First local transmission\nOn 29 November, Cambodia reported its first known local community transmission on a woman in Phnom Penh with no history of overseas travel. The cluster was traced back to the daughter of the prison director, who showed symptoms in October, and may have had contact with an imported case. With a budget of $170 million, Cambodia thus began its vaccination programme on February 10. A large-scale outbreak detected in Phnom Penh in 20 February took place when two out of four Chinese nationals who breached quarantine at the Sokha Hotel a few days prior tested positive. An investigation by Al Jazeera English indicated after the quarantined persons had bribed security guards to be released, Phnom Penh's casino sector and human trafficking may have contributed to the outbreak. Later patients would be sent to Phnom Penh Quarantine Center in Prek Pnov District. On March 11, a Cambodian man, 50, died at 10:40 a.m. from chronic lung disease in Phnom Penh. In April 2021, a mass vaccination of Cambodia's textile workers began, with the view to help jump-start the country's post-pandemic economic recovery; the textile industry is worth an estimated $7 billion to Cambodia's economy. 544 of these were in Phnom Penh, mostly associated with cluster outbreaks at O'Russei market and a garment factory in Meanchey district. April–August 2021: city-wide lockdowns \nOn 6 April, home treatment for patients showing mild or no symptoms were introduced in Phnom Penh. The Interior Ministry announced in June that 10-20% of prisoners in certain prisons, representing several thousand people, had been infected by COVID-19. By June 16, It is reported that 3,076,775 people (1,494,797 females) have been vaccinated in Cambodia. Provinces that border Thailand (Banteay Meanchey, Oddar Meanchey, Battambang, Pailin, Pursat, Koh Kong, Preah Vihear) and Siem Reap were put into lockdown for 14 days to combat Delta variant transmission in community, starting from 29 July. Most were reported on migrants crossing from Thailand. A vaccination programme for 2 million people aged 12–17 would be run on 1 August, first in Phnom Penh, then Kandal, Sihanoukville and Koh Kong. On 1 August, MoH confirmed 109 new cases of Delta variant which 5 cases were detected in Phnom Penh. November 2021-present full reopening \nOn November 1, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that the country would be fully reopening all sectors, saying that the country had achieved herd immunity by vaccinating majority of its entire population. To expedite the reopening effort and promote tourism recovery, Hun Sen also ordered a removal of quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated travelers entering Cambodia by land, air or water, whether Cambodians or foreigners starting from November 15. Around 86,000 Cambodian migrant workers returned from Thailand as border closures took effect, with minimal employment opportunities upon their return. The pandemic severely impacted the tourism sector in Cambodia as international travel was disrupted by restrictions and all tourist visas were suspended. The coastal tourism hub of Sihanoukville was impacted by a drop in arrivals from China. In Siem Reap, ticket sales for Angkor National Park dropped to an average of 22 people per day during April, leaving Angkor Wat, typically bustling with thousands of tourists, almost empty. Humanitarian assistance \n\nOn 23 March 2020, a team of seven specialist physicians from southern China's Guangxi with medical supplies, including ventilators, medical masks, protective suits, test kits, and infrared temperature sensors, had landed in Phnom Penh to assist tackling the pandemic. On 21 May 2021, Cambodia received 528 packs of Cycloferon tablets and 520 packs of Cycloferon ampoules providing from Russia. Cambodia had donated millions of face masks and PPE to Laos, Myanmar, East Timor and Nepal. Through the Vaccine Maitri initiative, Cambodia would receive 1 million Covishield vaccine doses from India in March 2021. United Kingdom announced 415,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine donation to Cambodia, expecting to arrive in August 2021. Reception\n\nInitial response \nDuring the early stages of the pandemic, it was reported that Prime Minister Hun Sen was downplaying the pandemic and Cambodia was not responding in an effort to maintain its close diplomatic and economic relationship with China. In February, Hun Sen downplayed the risk of the virus at a press conference, suggesting the virus was sensationalized by the media and threatened to expel those present who were wearing masks. Unlike most other countries, Cambodia did not cease travel to and from China and did not evacuate its overseas citizens from Wuhan during the initial outbreak there. During a press conference on 27 July 2020, at the six month mark of the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom praised Cambodia for its success in \"preventing [a] large scale outbreak\", along with New Zealand, Rwanda, Vietnam and Thailand. The WHO also praised Cambodia's welcoming of the MS Westerdam. Testing procedures \nConcerns have been raised about the lack of widespread community testing in Cambodia. A number of people travelling from Cambodia have tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in other countries. Prisons \nNo prisoners were tested for COVID-19 despite coming into contact with officials who tested positive, prompting criticism from the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, particularly as Cambodia's prisons are often overcrowded. Prisons director Nuth Savna told VOD in December that several prisoners had fever but still did not test them, dismissing this as due to the change in weather. In June 2021, the Interior Ministry's Prisons Department admitted that 10-20% of prison inmates in certain prisons had been infected with COVID-19, indicating several thousand infections were initially not tested or reported. In April 2021, Phnom Penh police were criticised by Cambodian human rights groups and Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith for implementing caning to punish violators of the city's lockdown restrictions. This curious practise against the spread of the coronavirus gained international attention.

Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them.

None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.The episode has cast a chill on fetal tissue research in the United States.One institution posted a guard outside a lab where the research was being conducted.Fetal tissue has become harder for scientists to procure.In other countries, the research proceeds apace. The Trump administration is seeking alternatives to aborted fetuses for vaccine and virus researchers, but National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins recently backed such research. WASHINGTON — Scientists and politicians are clashing over the value of using “humanized mice” implanted with tissue harvested from aborted babies’ organs in ongoing federally funded research. By contrast, a leading stem-cell researcher last week told a congressional hearing considering axing about $100 million in federal grants to scientists performing research with fetal remains that using tissue from aborted babies is “antiquated” and unnecessary. Prentice described the case of Allison Carr, a multiple sclerosis patient whose doctors told her she would be completely disabled and on a feeding tube within five years. German doctors genetically corrected his stem cells and grew a new skin layer, which, grafted onto the boy’s body, allowed him to grow his own new healthy skin. The cell lines are controversial because they were drawn from aborted fetuses in the ’60s and ’70s. ABR, a primary culler of human tissue from aborted fetuses for decades, has purchased aborted tissue from Planned Parenthood. ABR employees featured in the extensive video footage captured in 2015 by the pro-life Center for Medical Progress. The group released clandestinely taped abortionists discussing details, Planned Parenthood Federation of America officials negotiating fees, and fetal-tissue procurers and sellers, including two women from ABR, discussing the trade in aborted babies’ intact hearts, brains, eyes, liver and thymus for profit, including from government contracts. Pro-lifers have had several wins in stemming the trade in the past two years, however. Meadows concluded the meeting by asking Temple and the other witnesses to return to the committee in 30 days with three recommendations to look at research using non-aborted fetuses. The procurement and funding of aborted fetal-tissue research is threatened, but for now it continues, and with the support of NIH Director Collins. But his Dec. 13 remarks supporting such research were criticized strongly by pro-life leaders, who said his position undermined the desire of the Trump administration to bring it to a halt. The recommendation to stop funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood by the House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel holds significance from both a political and ethical standpoint. The panel recommended that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) cease funding fetal tissue research and Planned Parenthood be stripped of U.S. funding. This recommendation aligns with the stance of Republicans who have long sought to block funding for Planned Parenthood due to their provision of abortions, along with birth control and preventive health services. The investigation was prompted by undercover videos released in 2015, where anti-abortion activists posed as biotechnology executives and interviewed senior physicians from Planned Parenthood. These videos revealed the provision of fetal tissue from legal abortions for medical research. Therefore, the recommendation to cease funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood raises important questions regarding the future of medical research and the potential impact on the development of new treatments. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states.Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts.The law stipulates that abortion clinics can be reimbursed only for costs when they provide fetal tissue for research. For some, the use of cells from Mrs. X's fetus will continue to be an abomination, no matter how long ago the abortion was and no matter that it would have happened anyway. Antiabortion activists recently took their fight beyond the use of fetal cells in vaccine-making, to attack any use of fetal tissue in research. In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research.

NLG2101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of indoximod 1200 mg orally, twice daily in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly in patients with metastatic ER/PR positive or negative, HER2 negative breast cancer. The trial, which reached its goal of 154 patients enrolled across multiple sites in the United States and Europe, is designed to evaluate the combination of indoximod and chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study's primary endpoint is progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of overall survival, response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria, safety, and immune response correlative assays. Preliminary evaluable safety data from 128 patients, when considered in a blinded fashion pooling control and treatments arms of the study, suggests that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Additionally, no unexpected safety signals were reported with the combination of indoximod with docetaxel or paclitaxel, suggesting that there is no additional or unique toxicity with the addition of indoximod to chemotherapy. Objective responses were achieved in an earlier Phase 1 trial combining indoximod and docetaxel in patients with metastatic solid tumors, including breast tumors. \"I believe this is an exciting chemoimmunotherapy combination regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\" said Shou-Ching Tang, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Leader, Breast Cancer Multidisciplinary Team at Augusta University. The data, presented during the poster session \"Treatment: Immunotherapy,\" correspond to the abstract (P2-11-09) entitled, \"A phase 2 randomized trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod in combination with taxane based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: preliminary data.\" Indoximod is an orally available small molecule that has shown the potential to interfere with multiple targets within the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway. AMES, Iowa, April 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ: NLNK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing cancer therapeutics, today announced the initiation of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study of its first IDO (indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitor, indoximod, in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Phase 2 clinical study will evaluate indoximod as a new approach to treating cancer by administering this novel IDO pathway inhibitor, designed to counteract a key mechanism by which tumors evade immune-mediated destruction, in combination with a conventional cytotoxin, docetaxel. Indoximod is the most advanced product candidate to enter clinical trials based on NewLink's proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor platform for small-molecule, orally bioavailable cancer immunotherapies. \"There is significant unmet need for new approaches that may offer more effective treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer, a leading cause of death in women in the United States,\" said Hatem Soliman, MD, a medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer in The Center for Women's Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center and the principal investigator for this study. \"Indoximod, an IDO pathway inhibitor is an immune check point inhibitor akin to the recently developed antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of indoximod in combination with docetaxel as compared to docetaxel alone in up to 120 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Study endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, median overall survival and evaluation of pharmacodynamic tumor markers, in addition to safety. For more information about the study please refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Mechanism of action: Indoximod (1-methyl-d-tryptophan) is a small molecule, methylated tryptophan, anti-immunosuppressive-toleragenic, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitor. The unsuccessful results of these clinical trials prompted CancerVax to say it would cut payroll by more than half to roughly 80 employees from 183. The trial was evaluating MM-121 in combination with docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug, in patients with heregulin positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The SHERLOC study enrolled 109 patients with NSCLC. Objective response rate (ORR), time to progression and overall survival were key secondary endpoints. The patients need to have progressed after one or two lines of prior systemic therapies for metastatic or locally advanced disease and have received previous CDK inhibitor-based therapy. Key secondary endpoints are objective response rate, time to progression and overall survival. Efficacy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was evaluated in 105 adult participants with rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with platinum chemotherapy. Efficacy for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was evaluated in participants 12 years of age and older with RET-mutant MTC. The study enrolled 143 participants with advanced or metastatic \n\nA new director for the National Cancer Institute, an early release of data in prostate cancer, disappointing findings in a renal cell carcinoma trial, enrollment paused in 2 multiple myeloma studies, and discontinuation of a phase III colorectal cancer trial. This new protocol revises the planned analyses of the primary and several secondary endpoints, reducing the target patient population to 1440 patients, down from 1560. The FDA approved enzalutamide in 2012 as a treatment for men with late-stage CRPC previously treated with docetaxel. In 2014, the agency approved the drug for first-line therapy based on results from the phase III PREVAIL trial, in which enzalutamide improved OS by 29% and radiographic progression-free survival by 81% compared with placebo. The FDA expanded enzalutamide’s label again in 2016 based on findings from the phase II TERRAIN trial, in which enzalutamide reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 40% versus bicalutamide, and improved median rPFS by 6.1 months in patients with metastatic CRPC. In renal cell carcinoma, the combination of dalantercept plus axitinib failed to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced disease compared with placebo. Frequency of grade 3 or higher adverse events, regardless of causality, were similar between the 2 groups. An external Data Monitoring Committee recommended halting new enrollment while the company collects more data to better understand reported deaths in the pembrolizumab arms. This decision strictly affects KEYNOTE-183 and KEYNOTE-185 and no other pembrolizumab studies. KEYNOTE-183 is comparing the combination of pembrolizumab, pomalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have undergone at least 2 lines of prior treatment. KEYNOTE-185 is comparing pembrolizumab, lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Finally, the phase III XCITE study of MABp1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer has been cancelled by its manufacturer XBiotech after a second prospectively planned, unblinded analysis. In its statement announcing the decision, XBiotech said its independent data monitoring committee determined that data were not sufficient to meet efficacy or the threshold for continuation. Results from XCITE were presented at the 2016 World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancer, but even at that time, healthcare professionals questioned the data.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

You actually learn how to control its movement through the stability of your core muscles. In Pilates, the quality of movement is valued over quantity of repetitions. Some exercises are so precise and controlled doing only a few are all that is needed. Modification to the exercises is key here. Strengthening postural muscles is a key component in Pilates exercises. Sports performance is greatly improved because Pilates builds balanced muscle development, core strength, and flexibility through efficient and purposeful movement. Many conventional workouts practiced by athletes build strength and mass in specific muscle groups but ignore others. The result is muscular imbalance – a primary cause of injury and deteriorating athletic performance. In Pilates, no one muscle group is overly trained. You will learn how to move efficiently–Pilates exercises train several muscle groups at once in smooth, continuous movements. Many of the exercises are performed in reclining or sitting positions, yet are weight bearing to reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis. Pilates is so safe, it is used in physical therapy facilities to rehabilitate injuries. It is also an extremely flexible exercise system. Modifications to the exercises allow for a range of difficulty from beginners, those post-rehab, all the way to advanced practitioners. At each of these levels, the workout is modified to suit you now, and intensity increases as your body conditioning improve. There is nothing specifically different about Pilates training for men, especially in the beginning. The Pilates method is the same for all. Developed on a man’s body, and taught with input from both men and women, Pilates is founded on healthy movement principles for the human body in general. Men might find that their muscles are a little tighter than women’s, especially in the hips and hamstrings, but exercises can be easily modified to allow those areas to stretch out gradually. It is important that your progression follows a safe and effective path to optimize your workout. If you are taking private lessons, or classes, you will work deeper with more control and precision as you progress. Your bones will strengthen, muscles will tone and firm, and you will look fit. But, most of all, as you work out and begin to feel better physically, we hope you will also begin to feel better mentally. Movement in Pilates initiates from your center. Coordinating your breathing is an integral part of most Pilates exercises. Flow – Continuous movement through each exercise with fluidity and grace without wasted or unintentional placement of your body. Transitioning smoothly from one exercise to the next will build stamina and endurance. Classical Pilates is an exercise method developed by Joseph Pilates nearly a century ago. Systematic, sequential order of exercises that focus on flow, which develops endurance and stamina. Exercises are taught with a unique and dynamic rhythm and progression occurs as mastery of the exercises can be done with control and precision. Don’t flatten out or over-arch the curve in the lower back by tilting the pelvis. The abdominals, back, hip and shoulder girdle muscles all working together. These are the main stabilizing muscles and are very important for preventing injury to the spine. In Pilates, we use diaphragmatic breathing as the ribcage expands laterally (side to side) and towards the back of the ribcage. Lengthen Your Legs- Stretch the muscles of your legs without tensing or overly pointing your feet. Keep your hips even. Imagine someone gently pulling your legs by the ankles. Pilates Stance vs. Avoid letting your shoulders lift to your ears, draw them down and back. Articulate the Spine- Roll forward or backward through the spine one vertebra at a time. Feel as though you are imprinting each bone into the mat as you roll up or down. “Engage” your Abdominals- Use the deep abdominal muscles to stabilize your body before you move, and to initiate the movement. Zip your Thighs Together- Squeeze the inner thighs and sitz bones toward each other, actively pressing your legs together. Tabletop Legs- Lie on your back and raise your legs to a 90-degree angle from your body. Lengthen on each side of your waist- Even though your spine is in a curve, do not let your ribs collapse onto your waist. Keep length and space from your bottom ribs to the top of your hips. To avoid collapsing into your ribs, pretend you’re curving over a porcupine. Work in Opposition- When you sit on the floor, try to lengthen your spine upward. At the same time, push your legs into the floor, and reach through your heels. Or as you reach up, draw your shoulder blades down your back. The effort of lengthening in both directions builds stabilization and makes each movement a whole-body exercise. Mat classes are often the first experience most people have with Pilates. Recreation centers, health clubs, and community gyms may offer mat classes to its members. This is a valid concern in the Pilates industry. But it is important to do both, and there’s nothing quite like a challenging mat class; and the more experience you have in Pilates, the harder the mat classes can be.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

First and foremost, it ensures equal access to education for all students, regardless of their mental health condition. By providing reasonable accommodations, postsecondary institutions can create an inclusive environment that supports the success and well-being of students with mental illness. Accommodations such as extended time for exams, modified attendance policies, or flexibility in assignment deadlines can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by students with mental illness. These accommodations acknowledge that individuals with mental health conditions may experience periods of heightened symptoms or difficulty managing their daily lives, and provide the necessary support to help them navigate their academic journey. Moreover, academic accommodations can contribute to the overall mental well-being of students with mental illness. Importantly, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness is not just a matter of fairness, but also a legal obligation. The American Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and its 2008 amendments mandate that students with psychiatric disabilities be provided with reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. By complying with these legal requirements, postsecondary institutions can prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities for students with mental illness. In summary, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness in postsecondary education is significant because it ensures equal access to education, supports mental well-being, improves academic performance, and fulfills legal obligations. Mental health negligence can be attributed to low-income communities being \n\n Chemistry Department Chairman, stated that \"Jason's death prompted an examination of the role the department should play in graduate students' lives\". Anderson went on to promise that students will also have \"confidential and seamless access\" to psychological counselling services, paid for by the department. Harvard students currently have unlimited access to mental health services if seen by a psychologist or psychiatrist at University health services and up to 40 sessions of regular outside care with a copay as part of their continuing effort to provide access to mental health care. From Medscape.com How Medical Schools Can Meet Mental Health Needs of Students - Medscape - Oct 03, 2018. Medical students have higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout compared with the general population, as well as greater concerns about the stigma of mental illness, write Jordan F. Karp, MD, and Arthur S. Levine, MD, both from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, in the NEJM article. \"We have long been aware of how many healthcare professionals struggle with burnout,\" commented Darrell G. Kirch, MD, president and chief executive officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, \"And how many slip into anxiety and depression.\" \"But now we are acknowledging that this problem exists, and we were in denial about the toll it was taking on people working in healthcare.\" Medical schools are a great point to start to work on these issues.\" The 1992 Association of American Medical Colleges Recommendations Regarding Health Services for Medical Students \"remains relevant and includes sensible guidance\" related to mental health issues, note Karp and Levine. These recommendations include providing all students with access to confidential counseling by mental health professionals and establishing confidentiality policies, as well as creating clear policies about administratively mandated evaluation and treatment. But these recommendations may not be optimally implemented by the school because of a lack of resources. Students who are still covered by their parents' health insurance plans may not want their families to know they are receiving mental health treatment, the authors point out, and hectic schedules and lack of time also present barriers to care. At the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, an aggressive and proactive approach has been taken to ease the transition into medical school, reduce stress, and importantly, address the main challenges that students having mental health issues commonly contend with: access, privacy, and stigma. They have created a dedicated medical student mental healthcare team, and it is financially supported by the medical school to provide care for the 560 medical students and 360 graduate students. \"All mental health care is provided to students at no cost, and insurance is never billed, which minimizes students' concerns about stigma and future insurability,\" they emphasize. And to reduce concerns about confidentiality, all \"[t]reatment notes are stored in the firewall-protected electronic medical record of the university counseling center, which is separate from the university hospital's electronic medical record.\" The program also ensures that a psychiatrist will be available to evaluate students who take a voluntary or mandated leave of absence and to give them psychiatric clearance when they return from medical leave and reenter medical school. The Student Health Advocacy Resource Program is organized by medical students and supervised by faculty members from the departments of Medicine and Psychiatry. During the 2016 to 2017 academic year, the psychologist was consulted by 16% of students, for a total of 850 visits, with 150 students seen. Finally, the authors point to other schoolwide initiatives that can help improve mental health and reduce stress among students, such as the Faculty and Students Together program, which assists in making the transition into medical school. \"Other medical schools must make the same financial investment and commitment that we have made to achieve a similar result,\" Levine told Medscape Medical News. These include appointing faculty \"wellness advisors,\" sponsoring wellness initiatives to promote self-care, and bringing university counseling center staff on site for regular clinics. \"Our program is known to and available to medical students, residents, faculty, and professional staff, and is readily available to all,\" said Sidney Zisook, MD, a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego Medical Center. \"Students also have access to student health and counseling services and our college mental health program, which has helped them overcome many of the obstacles to care.\" However, although these interventions are needed to ensure that medical students have access to confidential and appropriate mental healthcare, Srijan Sen, MD, PhD, Frances and Kenneth Eisenberg Professor of Depression and Neurosciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, feels that this a more system-level problem than an individual one. The way that medicine is practiced has also changed, Sen pointed out. Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

All women of childbearing age are offered pregnancy testing, as some of them do not know they are carrying a child until many months into pregnancy.

Medical uses\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\nTofacitinib citrate is approved for medical use in the United States with an indication \"to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate.\" It can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate. Ulcerative colitis\nIn May 2018, the FDA approved tofacitinib citrate \"for the treatment of adult patients in the U.S. with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\" The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first three months in controlled clinical trials (occurring in  2% or more of patients treated with tofacitinib citrate monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, headache, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis (the \"common cold\"). Laboratory monitoring is recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes, and lipids. In a mouse model of established arthritis, tofacitinib rapidly improved disease by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and suppressing STAT1-dependent genes in joint tissue. History\nThe potential significance of JAK3 inhibition was first discovered in the laboratory of John O'Shea, an immunologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The drug was coded as CP-690,550 during development. Its original recommended INN (rINN) was tasocitinib, but that was overruled during the INN approval process as being not optimally differentiable from other existing INNs, so the name \"tofacitinib\" was proposed and became the INN. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Two rheumatologists interviewed by the magazine Nature Biotechnology complained that they were \"shocked\" and \"disappointed\" at the $2,055 a month wholesale price. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib \"to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate. The FDA approved only the five-mg, twice-daily dose on the grounds that a higher dose was not considered to have an adequate risk-to-benefit ratio. Research\n\nIt has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of  psoriasis in phase III studies. It is being studied for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and other immunological diseases, as well as for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Psoriasis \nTofacitinib is a current investigational drug in psoriasis. It has demonstrated its effectiveness for plaque psoriasis in phase III, randomized, controlled trials in comparison to placebo and to etanercept. Approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of psoriasis was rejected by the FDA  due to safety concerns. Alopecia areata\n\nBased on preclinical studies in a mouse model of the disease, tofacitinib has been investigated for the treatment of alopecia areata.

Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. By 10 April, 4,072 confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities. In countries where the disease has been for the past three years and the cases confirmed are local (within the confines of the country) transmission is considered to be \"endemic.\" The epidemic in Yemen took over 2,500 lives and impacted over 1 million people of Yemen More outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Americas, and Haiti. The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. In cases of cholera gravis involving severe dehydration, up to 60% of patients can die; however, less than 1% of cases treated with rehydration therapy are fatal. In 2002, the WHO deemed that the case fatality ratio for cholera was about 3.95%. Médecins Sans Frontières reported at least 200 presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility. If more than 10% of the sperm are bound to anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), then infertility is suspected. The blood-testis barrier separates the immune system and the developing spermatozoa. Infertility after anti-sperm antibody binding can be caused by autoagglutination, sperm cytotoxicity, blockage of sperm-ovum interaction, and inadequate motility. In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Causes\nFactors relating to male infertility include:\n\nImmune infertility \nAntisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. Genetics\nChromosomal anomalies and genetic mutations account for nearly 10–15% of all male infertility cases. Klinefelter syndrome\nOne of the most commonly known causes of infertility is Klinefelter syndrome, affecting 1 out of 500–1000 newborn males Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal defect that occurs during gamete formation due to a non-disjunction error during cell division. Men with this condition can exhibit azoospermia (no sperm production), oligozoospermia (small number of sperm production), or they will produce abnormally shaped sperm (teratozoospermia). Pre-testicular causes\nPre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:\n\nVaricocele \nVaricocele is a condition of swollen testicle veins. Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. Drugs, alcohol\n Strenuous riding (bicycle riding, horseback riding)\n Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, cimetidine, spironolactone; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin\n Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation\n\nTobacco smoking\n\nThere is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles and kill sperm, but their effect on male fertility is not clear. Post-testicular causes\nPost-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation:\n Vas deferens obstruction\n Lack of Vas deferens, often related to genetic markers for cystic fibrosis\n Infection, e.g. prostatitis, male accessory gland infection\n Retrograde ejaculation\n Ejaculatory duct obstruction\n Hypospadias\n Impotence\n\nDiagnostic evaluations\nThe diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Medical history\nThe history should include prior testicular or penile insults (torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma), infections (mumps orchitis, epididymitis), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation, medications, and drug use (anabolic steroids, alcohol, smoking).Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor. The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy (retrograde ejaculation), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply). The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2–7 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature changes during transport can be avoided, which can be lethal for some spermatozoa. A single semen sample is not determining for disease diagnosis, so two different samples have to be analyzed with an interval between them of seven days to three months, as sperm production is a cyclic process. The volume of the semen sample (must be more than 1,5 ml), approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. This is also called as unexplained Infertility\nThere are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms \"oligoasthenoteratozoospermia\" or \"oligospermia\" can be used as a catch-all. - Drug stimulation\n\n- Percutaneous spermatozoa obtaining directly from epididymis, testes, etc. Neurological injury\n\n- Vibro-stimulation\n\n- Electro-stimulation\n Retrograde ejaculation\nThis type of ejaculation happens when there is a defect on prostate, so the sample is not ejaculated outside but to the bladder. - Just after that, the subject has to masturbate and ejaculate, obtaining then a new urine sample with ejaculation that will be stored on the second recipient. - Finally we have to obtain the next urine, 2nd urine, for potential ejaculation fraction, which will be stored in the third recipient. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Ultrasonography\nScrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer. Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele, when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. Prevention\nSome strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:\n Avoiding smoking as it damages sperm DNA\n Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions. Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved. Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF. A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. Giving oral antioxidants to men in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility may lead to an increase in the live birth rate but overall the risk of adverse effects is unclear. Hormonal therapy\n\nAdministration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, as seen in users of androgens/anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, including in men with severe oligospermia. Research\n\nResearchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis, including spermatozoa generation. Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, \"[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI's success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI's success depends.\" The population in different regions suffer from varying amounts of infertility. Starting in the late 20th century, scientists have expressed concerns about the declining semen quality in men. A study was done in 1992 with men who had never suffered from infertility showed that the amount of sperm in semen had declined by 1% per year since 1938. Doctors in India disclosed that the sperm count of a fertile Indian male had decreased by a third over a span of three decades. Researchers in Calcutta conducted a study between 1981 and 1985 that also showed a decrease in sperm motility and seminal volume, but no change in sperm concentration. Society and culture \nThere are a variety of social stigmas that surround male infertility throughout the world. A lot of research has pointed to the relationship between infertility and emasculation. In places like Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Mexico, erectile dysfunction also known as impotence, is considered a determinant of infertility. When stereotypical ideals of manhood are virility and strength, men sharing problems of infertility can face feelings of inadequacy, unworthiness, and have thoughts of suicide. For the Shona people, since impotence is linked to infertility, an examination to check on the penile function spans from infancy to post marriage. At infancy, there are daily check-ups by the mothers on the son's erection and urine quality. When the son reaches puberty, they are asked to ejaculate in river banks and for their male elders to examine sperm quality.

The volume of the semen sample (must be more than 1,5 ml), approximate number of total sperm cells, sperm motility/forward progression, and % of sperm with normal morphology are measured. This is the most common type of fertility testing. This is also called as unexplained Infertility\nThere are various combinations of these as well, e.g. Low sperm counts are often associated with decreased sperm motility and increased abnormal morphology, thus the terms \"oligoasthenoteratozoospermia\" or \"oligospermia\" can be used as a catch-all. - Drug stimulation\n\n- Percutaneous spermatozoa obtaining directly from epididymis, testes, etc. Neurological injury\n\n- Vibro-stimulation\n\n- Electro-stimulation\n Retrograde ejaculation\nThis type of ejaculation happens when there is a defect on prostate, so the sample is not ejaculated outside but to the bladder. - Just after that, the subject has to masturbate and ejaculate, obtaining then a new urine sample with ejaculation that will be stored on the second recipient. - Finally we have to obtain the next urine, 2nd urine, for potential ejaculation fraction, which will be stored in the third recipient. A blood sample can reveal genetic causes of infertility, e.g. Ultrasonography\nScrotal ultrasonography is useful when there is a suspicion of some particular diseases. It may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, which is often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of testicular cancer. Doppler ultrasonography useful in assessing venous reflux in case of a varicocele, when palpation is unreliable or in detecting recurrence or persistence after surgery, although the impact of its detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters and overall fertility is debated. Such abnormalities are associated with abnormalities in sperm parameters, as are abnormalities in the texture of the epididymis. Prevention\nSome strategies suggested or proposed for avoiding male infertility include the following:\n Avoiding smoking as it damages sperm DNA\n Avoiding heavy marijuana and alcohol use. Maintaining optimal frequency of coital activity: sperm counts can be depressed by daily coital activity and sperm motility may be depressed by coital activity that takes place too infrequently (abstinence 10–14 days or more). In terms of food groups, fish, shellfish and seafood, poultry, cereals, vegetables and fruits, and low-fat dairy products have been positively related to sperm quality. However, diets rich in processed meat, soy foods, potatoes, full-fat dairy products, coffee, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets have been inversely associated with the quality of semen in some studies. Pre-testicular conditions can often be addressed by medical means or interventions. Testicular-based male infertility tends to be resistant to medication. Usual approaches include using the sperm for intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or IVF with intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). With IVF-ICSI even with a few sperm pregnancies can be achieved. Obstructive causes of post-testicular infertility can be overcome with either surgery or IVF-ICSI. Ejaculatory factors may be treatable by medication, or by IUI therapy or IVF. A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. Giving oral antioxidants to men in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained subfertility may lead to an increase in the live birth rate but overall the risk of adverse effects is unclear. Hormonal therapy\n\nAdministration of luteinizing hormone (LH) (or human chorionic gonadotropin) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is very effective in the treatment of male infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Though androgens are absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and therefore male fertility, exogenous testosterone therapy has been found to be ineffective in benefiting men with low sperm count. Moreover, exogenous androgen therapy can actually impair or abolish male fertility by suppressing gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, as seen in users of androgens/anabolic steroids (who often have partially or completely suppressed sperm production). This is because suppression of gonadotropin levels results in decreased testicular androgen production (causing diminished local concentrations in the testes) and because FSH is independently critical for spermatogenesis. As such, clomiphene citrate (an antiestrogen) and aromatase inhibitors such as testolactone or anastrozole have shown effectiveness in benefiting spermatogenesis. Low-dose estrogen and testosterone combination therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men, including in men with severe oligospermia. Research\n\nResearchers at Münster University developed in vitro culture conditions using a three-dimensional agar culture system which induces mouse testicular germ cells to reach the final stages of spermatogenesis, including spermatozoa generation. Researchers from Montana State University developed precursors of sperm from skin cells of infertile men. comment on the success of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in women saying, \"[t]hus, the woman carries the treatment burden for male infertility, a fairly unique scenario in medical practice. Ironically, ICSI's success has effectively diverted attention from identifying what causes male infertility and focused research onto the female, to optimize the provision of eggs and a receptive endometrium, on which ICSI's success depends.\" The population in different regions suffer from varying amounts of infertility. Starting in the late 20th century, scientists have expressed concerns about the declining semen quality in men. A study was done in 1992 with men who had never suffered from infertility showed that the amount of sperm in semen had declined by 1% per year since 1938. Doctors in India disclosed that the sperm count of a fertile Indian male had decreased by a third over a span of three decades. Researchers in Calcutta conducted a study between 1981 and 1985 that also showed a decrease in sperm motility and seminal volume, but no change in sperm concentration. Society and culture \nThere are a variety of social stigmas that surround male infertility throughout the world. A lot of research has pointed to the relationship between infertility and emasculation. In places like Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Mexico, erectile dysfunction also known as impotence, is considered a determinant of infertility. When stereotypical ideals of manhood are virility and strength, men sharing problems of infertility can face feelings of inadequacy, unworthiness, and have thoughts of suicide. For the Shona people, since impotence is linked to infertility, an examination to check on the penile function spans from infancy to post marriage. At infancy, there are daily check-ups by the mothers on the son's erection and urine quality. When the son reaches puberty, they are asked to ejaculate in river banks and for their male elders to examine sperm quality.

According to researchers at Boston University, CTE is a brain disease involving progressive neurological deterioration common in athletes, military personnel, and others who have a history of brain trauma. Symptoms from CTE do not typically appear in a subject until many years after the initial injuries, and a conclusive diagnosis of the disease can only be achieved through autopsy. Although CTE remains mysterious and controversial, researchers have observed a link between the disease and the protein called tau, which slowly forms clumps in the brain that kill brain cells. This often results in subjects experiencing depression, anxiety, memory loss, headaches, and sleep disturbances. Mission and Practices \nThe goal of the Boston University CTE Center is to collect and study post-mortem brains to better understand the long-term diseases associated with head trauma. Specifically, the CTE Center focuses its research on the formation of neurodegenerative diseases, including Post-Concussion Syndrome and CTE. During case studies, researchers at the CTE Center perform high-impact tests and in-depth autopsies on post-mortem brains to further understand the neuropathology and clinical presentation of CTE. The Center's ultimate goal is to develop a test that would definitively diagnose CTE in a living subject. In order to accomplish this, researchers at Boston University made it a priority to study as many post-mortem brains as possible, which led to the formation of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. Currently, the Brain Bank contains over 600 brains, including 325 brains that have been diagnosed with CTE since the formation of the bank. Employees of the Brain Bank collect tissue samples from the central nervous system (brain, eyes, and spinal cord) of deceased athletes, most notably American football professionals, and military veterans. The Bank then stores these samples optimally to ensure proper care and treatment before, during, and after research testing. The Brain Bank directors will also share findings with family members and caregivers of the deceased. Her research focuses on CTE and the late effects of neurodegeneration. This publication discussed 47 instances of neuropathological deterioration determined to be CTE. The study was primarily conducted to develop a more accurate clinical presentation of CTE in the brain. Through in-depth autopsies, the researchers observed the formation of proteins in the brain that caused initial brain cell decay, ultimately leading to CTE in the brain. This study was released in 2015 and detailed the autopsies performed by researchers on the donated brains and brain tissue. These examinations were performed at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels, in order to identify important neuropathological characteristics of CTE, including how the brain deteriorates over time, and the distribution of proteins in brains with CTE. Through microscopic examination, the researchers were able to confirm the role of the tau protein in CTE diagnosis, as well as other proteins that are signs of this degenerative disease. From these post-mortem tests, researchers were able to detail the characteristics of the various stages of CTE. In the study, the Boston University researchers grouped the subjects into four distinct stages of CTE, with each stage increasing in severity. These increased donations allowed for a larger case study, which would give researchers an opportunity to paint a clearer picture of the disease in a brain. In addition, the most common cause of death among participants was neurodegeneration or suicide. Each brain was evaluated and CTE p-tau pathology for the brains were classified into a stage of CTE. These results suggested CTE might be related to participation in football, and higher levels of play may increase the likelihood of the disease. Potential Applications of CTE Research \nCurrent CTE research has primarily focused on how the disease could potentially impact the world of sports. As CTE continues to gain notoriety, research focus has shifted to developing a test for diagnosing the disease in a living person. By studying and diagnosing post mortem brains with CTE, researchers at the Boston University CTE Center have been able to map out the disease in the brain, specifically, the various proteins that develop in an affected brain. The most important of these proteins is the tau protein, that leads directly to the formation of the disease in the brain. This protein forms as a result of blows taken within the skull, resulting in rapid movement of the brain. By analyzing how and where this protein forms within the brain, researchers can potentially map the protein in living individuals, and predict the development of the disease. As research into the disease continues, leaders of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank hope to utilize their findings to develop methods for treating and preventing the disease.

The research found that they were suffering from the progressive degenerative brain disease that’s been linked to repeated head trauma. This landmark research was done by investigators at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) and the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, in collaboration with the Sports Legacy Institute (SLI). The study described 68 cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among deceased athletes and military veterans whose brain and spinal cords were donated to the VA CSTE Brain Bank. Dr. Ann McKee, professor at Boston University School of Medicine, director of the Neuropathology Service for VA New England Healthcare System and co-director of the CSTE, led the study, which is the first to characterize the pathology of the disease into four stages of severity. CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated brain trauma, including concussions and multiple subconcussive exposures such as those in contact sports and military combat, the press release explained. “In early stages, CTE is characterized by the presence of abnormal deposits of a protein called tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles and neuropil threads throughout the brain,” according to the release. “These tau lesions eventually lead to brain cell death. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem. The report provides specific pathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE and divides CTE into four stages of disease (Stages I-IV), according to the press release. “In Stage III, reported symptoms included cognitive impairment and problems with executive functions, specifically planning, organization, multitasking and judgment,” according to the release. One-third of the CTE cases were diagnosed with additional neurodegenerative disease, including: motor neuron disease (12 percent), Lewy body disease (16 percent), Alzheimer’s disease (11 percent) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (six percent). Researchers cautioned that further studies are needed to investigate the incidence and prevalence of CTE; whether the symptoms of CTE are distinct from other conditions; how genetics influence susceptibility or resistance to CTE; and whether other environmental exposures also play an additive role in the development of CTE. “While it remains unknown what level of exposure to brain trauma is required to trigger CTE, there is no available evidence that occasional, isolated or well-managed concussions give rise to CTE,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, a coauthor of the paper and co-director of CSTE as well as co-founder of SLI. A new study has revealed a startlingly high number of former football players had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of their deaths, including 110 of 111 NFL players tested. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with head trauma. Simply put, it causes damage to brain cells that results in cell death and worsens over time. But as it develops, CTE can lead to worsening dementia and death. It was first identified in boxers in the 1920s as “punch-drunk” dementia and then “dementia pugilistica,” and its underlying pathology was described in 1973. Because of this, CTE may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s and FTD, though research has not yet confirmed this. Since 1973, CTE has been diagnosed in boxers, wrestlers, military veterans, and baseball, football, ice hockey, rugby, and soccer players. A 2015 report on the brain health risks of youth sports co-sponsored by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) also found that children who played contact sports were at risk of developing CTE later in life. But efforts are underway to develop diagnostic tools for living patients. The ADDF is funding Sam Gandy, MD, PhD, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai for one such project. Dr. Gandy is using 18F-AV-1451, a PET imaging agent being developed by Avid Pharmaceuticals, to try to image tau tangles and threads in the brains of people who have sustained multiple head injuries. It could also be used to assess CTE risk in younger players by detecting the presence of tau in the brain after a head injury. At Harvard Medical School, Neil Vasdev, PhD, is also working on a tau imaging program with support from the ADDF. Dr. Vasdev is using 18F-MK-6240, a PET imaging agent created by Merck that binds to tau deposits in the brain in a different way. He and his team are testing their PET scan in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. Having multiple diagnostic tools is important for differentiating between the multiple diseases that involve tau. But their chances of success and ability to recruit the right patients will be greatly improved with tau diagnostics. It’s critical to understand what kind of tau—and therefore, which disease—a patient has they can test a treatment designed specifically for it.

Inflammation has also been connected to depression,  and a 2016 study found broccoli sprouts effective to “prevent or minimize the relapse by inflammation.”  This same study found that the extracts of broccoli sprouts were so effective, they acted as a prophylactic that could “prevent the onset of LPS-induced depression-like behaviors” in the juvenile and adolescent mice they were testing, all the way into adulthood. More research is being done on the phytochemicals of cruciferous vegetables and depression. A 2000 study on female fibromyalgia patients reported that the combination of ascorbigen (derived from Vitamin C) and broccoli powder “reduces pain sensitivity and improves quality of life”  for patients suffering from this challenging condition. “[T]he results show that a relatively short dietary treatment with broccoli sprouts can strongly protect the heart against oxidative stress and cell death caused by ischemia-reperfusion.”  R Which is promising, indeed! One particularly interesting study was carried out on young male smokers, in which 250g/day of broccoli was consumed, for a ten-day period. In 2015 broccoli sprout extract was again found highly effective in reducing of oxidative stress,  in this case being observed to assist with healthy liver function. As anti-inflammatories go, sulforaphane is right up there with that king of all spices, curcumin (turmeric) giving our cruciferous vegetables the upper hand in the list of healing foods. “[T]he consumption of broccoli sprouts modulated the excretion of biomarkers linked to inflammation and vascular reactions,”  according to a 2015 study.

It released a manual of HIV-specific laws and prosecutions in the 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. territories, federal government, and military in 2010. 3053, The Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act or the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act. The REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act calls for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. The bill died in the Subcommittee on Health, and also in 2013/2014 when \n\n of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights released a report on the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure in Canada with four recommendations for the House of Commons and the Canadian Government. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and \"HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual’s partner is on PrEP or (4) \n\nThe HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (the HOPE Act) is a law that modifies rules regarding organ donation between HIV-positive individuals. The law authorizes clinical research and the revision of rules about organ donation and transportation as a result of the research. The use of HIV-positive organs was previously a federal crime. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act revised the Organ Transplant Amendments Act of 1988, a law that prevented patients from receiving organs from HIV positive people. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act shortened organ transplant wait times, including the wait times for people without HIV as more HIV positive patients receive organs. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act amends the Public Health Service Act to repeal the requirement that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network adopt and use standards of quality for the acquisition and transportation of donated organs that include standards for preventing the acquisition of organs infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The bill replaces this requirement with authorization for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are: (1) infected with such virus before receiving such an organ; and (2) participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations regarding organs infected with HIV developed under this Act or, if participation in such research is no longer warranted, receiving a transplant under such standards and regulations. Finally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to declare that an organ donation does not violate the prohibition against a knowing organ donation by an HIV-infected individual if the donation is made in accordance with this Act. The bill removes a provision in current law that prohibits the acquisition and procurement of donated organs that are infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. S. 330 also requires the Secretary of HHS to develop guidelines for conducting research relating to organ transplants from donors who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Procedural history\nThe HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was introduced into the Senate on February 14, 2013 by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D, CA). The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was received in the United States House of Representatives on June 18, 2013. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act would be considered under a suspension of the rules on the House floor on November 12, 2013. According to the Human Rights Campaign, \"the Act is supported by dozens of organizations that advocate on transplant policy and communities with an increased need for transplantation, including: AIDS United, amfAR, American Medical Association, American Society for Nephrology, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, American Society of Transplantation, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, Dialysis Patient Citizens, HIV Medicine Association, and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).\" See also\n List of bills in the 113th United States Congress\n United Network for Organ Sharing\n Organ donation\n HIV/AIDS\n\nNotes/References\n\nExternal links\n\n Library of Congress - Thomas S. 330\n beta.congress.gov S. 330\n GovTrack.us S. 330\n OpenCongress.org S. 330\n WashingtonWatch.com S. 330\n Congressional Budget Office report on S. 330\n\nUnited States federal health legislation\nActs of the 113th United States Congress\nHIV/AIDS\nOrgan donation\n\n In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or \"negligent\" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. Criminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the U.S., have enacted laws expressly to criminalize HIV transmission or exposure, charging those accused with criminal transmission of HIV. People have been accused of and charged for HIV non-disclosure even if no harm was intended and if HIV was not actually transmitted. Legal situation\nIn many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV.

In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. From a global perspective, the U.S. and Canada account for the vast majority of reported prosecutions. Australia\nIn Australia the regulations concerned with the transmission of HIV are found in two sources, the Public Healths Acts and in the criminal law. New South Wales\nThe New South Wales (NSW) Public Health Act from 2010 regulates under section 79 that a person with HIV must disclose their status to all sexual partners. If talking about the problems of practising safe sex does not help, the doctor may obtain a Public Health Order to manage the behaviour of the HIV positive person. Only a small number of sex workers and clients have received a Public Health Order or 'management' intervention for potentially breaking the law. Under the criminal law, a person with HIV is criminally liable for prosecution if they have intentionally transmitted the virus to their partner without informing them of their status. Canada\nThough Canadian federal law does not contain any HIV-specific statutes, HIV transmission and exposure are otherwise prosecuted under general offense laws, such as aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault. Current law and policy \nCommonly referred to as \"HIV non-disclosure\", criminal transmission of HIV in Canada is defined as a \"realistic possibility of transmission\" of HIV during sexual intercourse. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and \"HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual's partner is on PrEP or (4) the type of sexual act (such as oral sex) is one where there is a negligible risk of transmission.\" This allows for four different scenarios in which HIV positive people will not have to disclose their status because of the nature of the sexual encounter; current laws only allow for one specific scenario with multiple requirements. HIV researchers have criticized the recommendations for not going far enough to counteract the adverse effects that the current law imposes on women. Although people living with HIV are generally aware of non-disclosure laws, many do not fully understand the law or understand when they do or do not have to disclose their status. History \nThe first notable case of HIV non-disclosure is R. v Cuerrier, where the defendant was charged with aggravated assault and sexual transmission of HIV under section 268 of the Criminal Code. The Court's ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected the English authority of R. v Clarence, with L'Heureux-Dubé stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment at the time of pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004–2006. Subsequent legal precedent has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning \"consensual\" sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. Because Cuerrier did not expressly define \"significant risk\", lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In Mabior, the Court found that \"significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused's viral load at the time of sexual relations was low or undetectable, and (ii) condom protection was used.\" He asked whether there is a legal obligation to disclose HIV status. He held up the case of Johnson Aziga, who was diagnosed in 1996 but then allegedly had unprotected sex with at least 13 women. The current precedent in Canada stands as any person who has HIV, fails to disclose the fact to their sexual partner, and does not take some sort of protective measure (such as condom use), is guilty of aggravated sexual assault as per Cuerrier and subsequent cases. Several Canadian courts had ruled that people who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex. Finland\nThe first case of criminal HIV infection in Finland was that of Steven Thomas, a US citizen from New York, who was convicted in 1997 in Helsinki for knowingly infecting Finnish women with HIV during 1993–1996. Thomas was found to have infected five of the 17 women with HIV, and was ordered to pay damages of $63,000–$73,000 to each infected victim. A Finnish man convicted of spreading HIV knowingly through unprotected sex with many women was Aki Matti Hakkarainen. Germany\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany on 16 August 2010, Nadja Benaissa of the German pop music group No Angels admitted to sex with several men while knowing her HIV-positive status, and infecting one of those several, who subsequently brought the case against her. Women groups were outraged at the possibility of a woman being charged for negligently spreading HIV. Libya\n\nThe HIV trial in Libya, also called 'the Bulgarian nurses affair', concerns the trials, appeals and eventual release of six foreign medical workers charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in Benghazi, Libya. New Zealand\nNew Zealand's first case for criminal HIV transmission occurred in 1993, when Peter Mwai, a Kenyan visiting New Zealand on a tourist visa, was sentenced to seven years in prison for infecting at least two women with HIV through unprotected sexual intercourse. Multiple women came forward saying they had unprotected sex with Mwai who had not told them he had HIV. On 6 October 2005 a New Zealand District Court ruled that HIV-positive people need not tell sexual partners about their status so long as safe sex is practiced. The same man was convicted of criminal nuisance earlier for having unprotected sex with another partner without revealing his HIV status. He faced charges of \"willfully and without justification or excuse causing in a male aged 20 and a female aged 19 a disease, namely HIV.\" Netherlands\nThree HIV-positive men, Peter Mulder, Hans Jurgens and Wim Dekker, were jailed in 2008 on charges of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm after drugging and raping 14 men, some of whom they injected with their own HIV-infected blood. 161 of the Criminal Code, persons who knowingly risk infecting others with HIV are liable to be jailed up to 3 years. Russia\nInfecting another individual with HIV is a criminal offense unless that individual knew about HIV infection beforehand and consented. As of 19 June 2006, there had been seven convictions for the sexual transmission of HIV in England and Wales under s.20 of the 1861 Act which, inter alia, criminalizes the reckless inflicting of grievous bodily harm. In R. v Dica the Court of Appeal held that a person was reckless if, knowing that they were HIV-positive, they transmitted HIV to a person who had not been told of the infection, and convicted him of a total sentence of 8 years' imprisonment. This suggests that consent will only operate as a defense—in all but the most exceptional of cases—where there has already been prior disclosure of known HIV-positive status. , two women have been convicted for passing on an HIV infection in the UK. In 2017, another man, Antonio Reyes-Minana, was convicted of grievous bodily harm after withholding his HIV status from two male partners. Presentations from the Economic and Social Research Council funded 2011 seminar series \"HIV/AIDS and Law: Theory, Practice and Policy\" at Keele University deal with the question of criminalization. Scotland\nIn February 2001 Stephen Kelly, an ex-prisoner and former IV drug user, was convicted of the Scots common law offence of \"recklessly injuring\" his former partner by infecting her with HIV. In HMA v Deveraux (2010), the HIV positive defendant pleaded guilty to reckless injury on four counts, one of which led to the victim contracting HIV. United States\n\nIn July 2010 the White House announced a major change in its HIV/AIDS policy, a change informed by public health law research carried out by Scott Burris, professor of law at Temple University and the director of its Public Health Law Research program. The Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States concluded that \"the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment.\" In the fall of 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the 'Positive Justice Project', a campaign to combat HIV-related stigma and discrimination against people with HIV by the U.S. criminal justice system. It released a manual of HIV-specific laws and prosecutions in the 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. territories, federal government, and military in 2010. 3053, The Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act or the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act. The REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act calls for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. Courts have looked into the statistical probability of HIV transmission to overturn or reduce criminal sentences resulting from prosecutions. For example, on 23 February 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reversed the aggravated assault conviction of Technical Sergeant David Gutierrez upon determining, that the risk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse was not \"likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm\" under the applicable statute. As of 2017, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that those who have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood cannot transmit the virus. Criticism of criminal statutes\nResearch has been done on the effects of the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure. It has been demonstrated that these types of laws increase HIV stigma and negatively affect public health. HIV non-disclosure laws and criminalization of HIV transmission may make people less likely to access HIV testing and less likely to disclosure their status or discuss sexual health with a healthcare provider. South Africa's openly HIV-positive Supreme Court Justice Edwin Cameron argued against criminalisation at the XVII International AIDS Conference in Mexico City.

Smoking cessation, usually called quitting smoking or stopping smoking, is the process of discontinuing tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Many strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including abruptly quitting without assistance (\"cold turkey\"), cutting down then quitting, behavioral counseling, and medications such as bupropion, cytisine, nicotine replacement therapy, or varenicline. Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as \"Cold Turkey\", or with home remedies. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was \"not at all difficult\" to stop, 27% said it was \"fairly difficult\", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Single medications include:\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Five medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking: transdermal nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhalers, nicotine oral sprays, and nicotine nasal sprays. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50 to 60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. A study found that 93% of over-the-counter NRT users relapse and return to smoking within six months. Antidepressants: The antidepressant bupropion is considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation and has been shown in many studies to increase long-term success rates. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline is higher than with bupropion or NRT. However, more recent studies indicate less serious neuropsychiatric side effects. For example, a 2016 study involving 8,144 patients treated at 140 centers in 16 countries \"did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo\". There is no good evidence anxiolytics are helpful. But it is important to know that the manufacturers of rimonabant and taranabant stopped production in 2008 due to its serious side effects. The 2008 US Guideline specifies that three combinations of medications are effective:\nLong-term nicotine patch and ad libitum NRT gum or spray\nNicotine patch and nicotine inhaler\nNicotine patch and bupropion (the only combination that the US FDA has approved for smoking cessation)\n\nA meta-analysis from 2018, conducted on 61 RCTs, showed that during their first year of trying to quit, approximately 80% of the participants in the studies who got drug assistance (bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) returned to smoking while 20% continued to not smoke for the entire year (i.e. In comparison, 12% the people who got placebo kept from smoking for (at least) an entire year. During the course of one year, the benefit from using smoking cessation medications (Bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) decreases from 17% in 3 months, to 12% in 6 months to 8% in 12 months. Cutting down to quit\nGradual reduction involves slowly reducing one's daily intake of nicotine. This can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the University of Birmingham found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation. When reducing the number of smoked cigarettes, it found some evidence that additional varenicline or fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy can have positive effects on quitting for six months and longer. It is estimated that \"comprehensive clean indoor laws\" can increase smoking cessation rates by 12%–38%. The US Task Force on Community Preventive Services found \"strong scientific evidence\" that this is effective in increasing tobacco use cessation  It is estimated that an increase in price of 10% will increase smoking cessation rates by 3–5%. This analysis distinguished between reactive (smokers calling quitlines) and proactive (smokers receiving calls) interventions. There is about 10% to 25% increase of the chance of smoking cessation success with the more behavioral support provided in person or via telephone when used as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. Biochemical feedback\nVarious methods exist which allow a smoker to see the impact of their tobacco use, and the immediate effects of quitting. Using biochemical feedback methods can allow tobacco-users to be identified and assessed, and the use of monitoring throughout an effort to quit can increase motivation to quit. Evidence wise, little is known about the effects of using biomechanical tests to determine a person's risk related to smoking cessation. Within hours of quitting, CO concentrations show a noticeable decrease, and this can be encouraging for someone working to quit. Breath CO monitoring has been utilized in smoking cessation as a tool to provide patients with biomarker feedback, similar to the way in which other diagnostic tools such as the stethoscope, the blood pressure cuff, and the cholesterol test have been used by treatment professionals in medicine. Like carbon monoxide, a cotinine test can serve as a reliable biomarker to determine smoking status. Even brief advice from physicians may have \"a small effect on cessation rates\" and there is evidence that the physicians' probability of giving smoking cessation advice declines with the person who smokes age. Another review found some positive effects when trained community pharmacists support the customers in their smoking cessation trials. Dental professionals also provide a key component in increasing tobacco abstinence rates in the community through counseling patients on the effects of tobacco on oral health in conjunction with an oral exam. According to the 2008 Guideline, based on two studies the training of clinicians in smoking cessation methods may increase abstinence rates; however, a Cochrane review found and measured that such training decreased smoking in patients. In one systematic review and meta-analysis, multi-component interventions increased quit rates in primary care settings. \"Multi-component\" interventions were defined as those that combined two or more of the following strategies known as the \"5 A's\":\nAsk — Systematically identify all tobacco users at every visit\nAdvise — Strongly urge all tobacco users to quit\nAssess — Determine willingness to make a quit attempt\nAssist — Aid the patient in quitting (provide counselling-style support and medication)\nArrange — Ensure follow-up contact\n\nSubstitutes for cigarettes\n\nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the general term for using products that contain nicotine but not tobacco to aid cessation of smoking. These include nicotine lozenges that are sucked, nicotine gum and inhalers, nicotine patches, as well as electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarette:   There is moderate certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase success rates for quitting compared to ECs without nicotine and NRT. The available evidence for their effectiveness in abstaining from smoking is inconclusive. A 2016 UK Royal College of Physicians report supports the use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool. Alternative approaches\nAcupuncture: Acupuncture has been explored as an adjunct treatment method for smoking cessation. However, a randomized trial published in 2008 found that hypnosis and nicotine patches \"compares favorably\" with standard behavioral counseling and nicotine patches in 12-month quit rates. However, the report by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) concludes \"STP (smokeless tobacco products) are addictive and their use is hazardous to health. A recent national study on the use of alternative tobacco products, including snus, did not show that these products promote cessation. Nicotine vaccines: Nicotine vaccines (e.g., NicVAX and TA-NIC) work by reducing the amount of nicotine reaching the brain; however, this method of therapy needs more investigations to establish its role and determine its side effects. Neither the Cochrane review nor the 2008 Guideline recommends medications for adolescents who smoke. The 2008 US Guideline determined that \"person-to-person psychosocial interventions\" (typically including \"intensive counseling\") increased abstinence rates in pregnant women who smoke to 13.3%, compared with 7.6% in usual care. In addition, these babies have weaker immune systems, making them more susceptible to many diseases such as middle ear inflammations and asthmatic bronchitis as well as metabolic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, all of which can bring significant morbidity. Additionally, a study published by American Academy of Pediatrics shows that smoking during pregnancy increases the chance of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID). There is also an increased chance that the child will be a smoker in adulthood. It is a myth that a female smoker can cause harm to a fetus by quitting immediately upon discovering she is pregnant. Schizophrenia\n\nStudies across 20 countries show a strong association between patients with schizophrenia and smoking. For example, in the United States, 80% or more of people with schizophrenia smoke, compared to 20% of the general population in 2006. A 2010 systematic review determined that worksite incentives and competitions needed to be combined with additional interventions to produce significant increases in smoking cessation rates. Hospitalized smokers\n\nSmokers who are hospitalised may be particularly motivated to quit. Patients undergoing elective surgery may get benefits of preoperative smoking cessation interventions, when starting 4–8 weeks before surgery with weekly counseling intervention for behavioral support and use of nicotine replacement therapy. A higher correlation with smoking has also been seen in people diagnosed with major depressive disorder at any time throughout the duration of their lifetime as compared to those without the diagnosis. Success rates in quitting smoking were lower for those with a major depressive disorder diagnosis versus people without the diagnosis. Exposure of cigarette smoke early on in life during pregnancy, infancy, or adolescence may negatively impact a child's neurodevelopment and increase the risk of developing anxiety disorders in the future. These unique barriers can be combated through pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling for high levels of nicotine dependence, emphasis of immediate financial benefits to those who concern themselves with the short-term over the long-term, partnering with shelters to reduce the social acceptability of smoking in this population, and increased taxes on cigarettes and on alternative tobacco products to further make the addiction more difficult to fund. People in treatment for or recovery from substance use disorders \nOver three-quarters of people in treatment for substance use are current smokers. Providing counseling and pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy such as patches or gum, varenicline, and/or bupropion) increases tobacco abstinence without increasing the risk of returning to other substance use. Robert West and Saul Shiffman, authorities in this field recognized by government health departments in a number of countries, have concluded that, used together, \"behavioral support\" and \"medication\" can quadruple the chances that a quit attempt will be successful. A 2008 systematic review in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention found that group behavioural therapy was the most effective intervention strategy for smoking cessation, followed by bupropion, intensive physician advice, nicotine replacement therapy, individual counselling, telephone counselling, nursing interventions, and tailored self-help interventions; the study did not discuss varenicline. Factors affecting success\nQuitting can be harder for individuals with dark pigmented skin compared to individuals with pale skin since nicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues. Studies suggest this can cause the phenomenon of increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rate in darker pigmented individuals. There is an important social component to smoking. The spread of smoking cessation from person to person contributes to the decrease in smoking these years. Smokers who are trying to quit are faced with social influences that may persuade them to conform and continue smoking. If a person who stopped smoking has close relationships with active smokers, he or she is often put into situations that make the urge to conform more tempting. Recent research from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey of over 6,000 smokers found that smokers with fewer smoking friends were more likely to intend to quit and to succeed in their quit attempt. Smokers with major depressive disorder may be less successful at quitting smoking than non-depressed smokers. In contrast, varenicline is suggested to have some effects and nicotine replacement therapy may help the unassisted abstainers. Smoking suppresses appetite, which may be caused by nicotine's effect on central autonomic neurons (e.g., via regulation of melanin concentrating hormone neurons in the hypothalamus). Possible reasons for this phenomenon include nicotine's ability to increase energy metabolism or nicotine's effect on peripheral neurons. The 2008 Guideline suggests that sustained-release bupropion, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenge be used \"to delay weight gain after quitting.\" This side effect of smoking cessation may be particularly common in women, as depression is more common among women than among men. Health benefits\n\nMany of tobacco's detrimental health effects can be reduced or largely removed through smoking cessation. A randomized trial from the U.S. and Canada showed that a smoking cessation program lasting 10 weeks decreased mortality from all causes over 14 years later. A recent article on mortality in a cohort of 8,645 smokers who were followed-up after 43 years determined that \"current smoking and lifetime persistent smoking were associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD [cardiovascular disease], COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], and any cancer, and lung cancer mortality.\" The findings were: 1) taken together, the studies demonstrated decreased the likelihood of postoperative complications in patients who ceased smoking prior to surgery; 2) overall, each week of cessation prior to surgery increased the magnitude of the effect by 19%.

Nicotine patches are under study to help relieve the symptoms of postoperative pain and to treat early dementia. Studies are being conducted about the use of transdermal nicotine patches to treat anxiety, depression, and inattentiveness in subjects with ADHD and to treat late-life depression. Two small studies have shown that transdermal nicotine patches improve some symptoms of ulcerative colitis. However, this is not the case with Crohn's disease, a similar health condition, where smoking and nicotine intake in general worsen the disease's effects. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medically approved way to treat people with tobacco use disorder by taking nicotine by means other than tobacco. It is used to help with quitting smoking or stopping chewing tobacco. It increases the chance of quitting tobacco smoking by about 55%. Types of NRT include the adhesive patch, chewing gum, lozenges, nose spray, and inhaler. Common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning and continued addiction. They do not appear to increase the risk of heart attacks. Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings caused by nicotine addiction. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses\n\nNicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. Nicotine replacement therapy is as effective as medications, such as bupropion, in helping people quit smoking for at least six months. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates. Using nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking should be considered for people who are severely dependent on nicotine. People who are severely dependent include those who smoke: more than one pack per day, within five minutes of awakening, while ill, when they wake up in the middle of the night, to ease withdrawal signs and symptoms. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has a smoking cessation service based on pharmacotherapy in combination with counseling support. However, the investment in NHS stop smoking services is relatively low. Pierce and Gilpin (2002) stated their conclusion as follows: “Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation” (p. 1260). Quit rates showed a dramatic decrease between 4-weeks and one year. A quit rate of 53% at four weeks fell to only 15% at one year. Younger smokers, females, pregnant smokers and more deprived smokers had lower quit rates than other groups. The efficacy for each of the formulations alone (lozenges, nasal spray, gum, and transdermal patch) to aid in smoking cessation is equal. Efficacy increases 15% to 36% with combining treatments such as gum and lozenges. Higher doses increase the chance of stopping smoking for a period of six months and more. E-cigarettes are twice as effective as NRT in helping people quit smoking. Pregnancy\nNicotine is not safe to use in any amount during pregnancy. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke. The gum, lozenge, and nasal spray are pregnancy category C. The transdermal patch is pregnancy category D. The transdermal patch is considered less safe for the fetus because it delivers continuous nicotine exposure, as opposed to the gum or lozenge, which delivers intermittent and thus lower nicotine exposure. There is evidence that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes. There is also risk of stillbirth and pre-term birth. Nicotine use will probably harm fetal neurological development. Risks to the child later in life from nicotine exposure during pregnancy include type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. It also puts the child at increased risk for nicotine addiction in the future. Evidence is unclear whether adolescents gain benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or smoking cessation over the long-term as of 2017. Smoking is known to cause cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Cigarette smoking is the cause of 20% of all cardiovascular deaths in the United States, which is the leading cause of mortality. Other conditions \nNicotine replacement therapies should be used cautiously in individuals with the following conditions: severe reactive airway diseases (for nasal spray), chronic nasal disorders such as sinusitis, polyps, rhinitis, or allergy (for nasal spray), diabetes (insulin-dependent), gastrointestinal diseases such as esophagitis, active gastric or peptic ulcer disease, liver problems, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, phenylketonuria (for lozenges), renal problems, and skin conditions such as psoriasis or dermatitis (for the transdermal patch). Side effects\n\nSome side effects are caused by the nicotine, and are common to NRT products. Other common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. The nicotine patch can also cause strange dreams if worn while asleep. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning, which includes symptoms like visual disturbances, hyper-salivation, nausea, and vomiting; and continued addiction to nicotine products. Avoiding smoking and other products with nicotine are recommended since it may lead to nicotine overdose. Mechanism of action\n\nNicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings due to nicotine addiction. Smoking cigarettes releases high doses of nicotine to the brain in a matter of seconds as opposed to low doses released over a period of minutes to hours by the various forms of nicotine replacement therapy. NRT relies on systemic venous absorption, whereas nicotine from cigarettes reaches the arterial system. The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk. Nicotine patches are applied to the skin and continuously administer a stable dose of nicotine slowly over 16–24 hours. Nicotine gum, nicotine sprays, nicotine toothpicks, nicotine sublingual tablets, and nicotine lozenges administer nicotine orally with quicker nicotine uptake into the body but lasting a shorter amount of time. Nicotine inhalers are metered-dose inhalers  that administer nicotine through the lungs and mucous membranes of the throat quickly, lasting for a short amount of time. For example, blood nicotine levels are the highest 5–10 minutes after using the nicotine nasal spray, 20 minutes after using a nicotine inhaler or chewing nicotine gum, and 2–4 hours after using a nicotine patch. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Formulations \n\nThe nicotine patch is a once-daily, longer-acting form of NRT. An advantage of the nicotine patch is its simple compliance; it does not require active use throughout the day. The gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, oral inhaler, oral spray, and nasal spray are acutely dosed products, providing the user with the benefit and ability of self-titrating based on cravings. Medicines \nIn 2015, the United States Public Health Service listed seven agents for the stopping of tobacco, which included five nicotine replacement treatments (nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays) and two oral medications (bupropion and varenicline). Other NRT options are available, including nicotine mouth sprays and sublingual tablets. Dosing\nThe dose of nicotine replacement therapy products is generally based on if the user is considered a heavy, average, or light smoker. Combining nicotine patch treatment with a faster nicotine-delivery means, like nicotine gum or spray, improves the likelihood of successful treatment. Not approved as NRTs\n\nSome smokeless consumer products available can function as alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) but they have not received FDA approval as smoking-cessation therapy aids that are safe and effective. Snus and nasal snuff also allow for nicotine administration outside of tobacco smoking. Nicotine pouches are described as similar to or a tobacco-free variant of snus. The evidence is that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than NRT methods. Some healthcare groups have hesitated to recommend e-cigarettes for quitting smoking, because of limited evidence of effectiveness and safety. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a list of additional tobacco products they are seeking to regulate, including electronic cigarettes. Most approved NRT products have been approved for over 20 years, however the FDA has also approved nicotine inhalers as a form of NRT. Future approaches of NRT could include nicotine preloading, a true pulmonary inhaler, and nicotine vaccines. The true pulmonary inhaler would deliver nicotine to the lungs in a manner that more resembles cigarette smoking, which would provide better relief of background cravings as well as acute cravings. Nicotine vaccines are under investigation as a method to treat tobacco dependence through priming the body to mount an immune response against nicotine.

In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested \n\n of the multiple causes of homosexuality. In 2017, Scientific Reports published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. LeVay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. This was popularly dubbed the \"gay gene\" in the media, causing significant controversy. This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X \n\nEvidence supporting the hypothesis that homosexuality has a biological basis comes from various studies. The research suggests that homosexuality is a deep-seated predisposition with a biological origin, similar to heterosexuality. The studies conducted by Kinsey and colleagues, for example, indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be attributed to a single social or psychological cause. One line of evidence supporting the biological basis of homosexuality involves morphological studies of the hypothalamus. Additionally, LeVay discovered that a specific cluster of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is larger in heterosexual men compared to women, as well as heterosexual men compared to homosexual men. Genetic studies also point towards a biological basis for homosexuality. Data from multiple studies show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins and 13 percent of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Inheritance patterns of male homosexuality often implicate a gene on the X chromosome, particularly from the maternal side. It is worth mentioning that psychoanalytic explanations and attempts to prove an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been substantiated by scientific evidence. The current consensus is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, although it may result in secondary reactive disturbances at times. Overall, the evidence from studies on brain morphology and genetics supports the hypothesis that homosexuality has a biological basis. - LeVay, S. \"A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men.\" \"A gene(s) for homosexuality?.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

According to the CDC, due to data collection \n\n the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion. There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China, India and Vietnam than in developed countries. within gestational limits, while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical, mental, or socioeconomic criteria. While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. 14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth.

Label=\"BACKGROUND AND AIM\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. Here, we investigated the effects of EMFs with long-term evolution (LTE, 1.762 GHz) and 5G (28 GHz) bandwidth on skin pigmentation in vitro. Murine and Human melanoma cells (B16F10 and MNT-1) were exposed to either LTE or 5G for 4 h per day, which is considered the upper bound of average smartphone use time. Collectively, these results imply that exposure to LTE and 5G EMFs may not affect melanin synthesis or skin pigmentation under normal smartphone use condition. There are two main types of electromagnetic radiation: non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation. On the other hand, ionizing radiation includes ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These higher frequency EMFs can lead to DNA and cellular damage with prolonged exposure. While non-ionizing radiation is generally considered safe, the use of certain devices that emit non-ionizing radiation, such as cell phones and microwaves, has raised concerns about potential health effects. However, extensive research has not demonstrated any consistent evidence linking these devices to harmful effects on human cells. It is always recommended to follow guidelines and safety measures to minimize any potential risks associated with electromagnetic radiation. Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In all the patients, visual inspection identified unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and the patients underwent craniotomy and lesionectomy. According to the results, eight patients were categorized in class I and two cases were classifies as class II, and all the patients survived. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy in children, which is difficult to control by medication (1). The results obtained by these methods should be interpreted in the context of clinical, electrographic, and MRI data. Neuroplasticity decreases by age; therefore, faster recovery is expected during infancy and early childhood. Nonetheless, intractable seizure is a risk factor for refractory epilepsy. As a result, patients with medically intractable TLE should undergo surgery as soon as possible (1,2). This prospective pilot study was conducted on 12 patients entailing five males and seven females, who aged between 2 and 16 years old with medically refractory mesial TLE confirmed by a pediatric neurologist. All the patients underwent MRI scanning, and if MRI did not reveal any abnormality, SPECT was performed. Interictal preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) was performed for all the patients in addition to pre- and post-operative (one year later) neuropsychological tests. Both EEG and neuropsychological examinations were accomplished in a blinded manner. These data were not taken into account during the process of surgical decision-making. The surgical outcomes were categorized to three classes including class I (seizure-free or simple partial seizures only), class II (worthwhile improvement [≥90%]), and no worthwhile improvement. The follow-up period ranged between 12 and 48 months, with mean and standard deviation of 24±5 months. Moreover, at the post-operative phase, no continuous video-EEG monitoring, PET, Wada test, or SPECT was performed. Given the surgical outcomes, eight patients were categorized in class I and two subjects were in class II (Table 1). No mortality occurred in any of the patients. In these two patients, the postoperative MRI revealed a posterior temporal cortical damage. TLE is the most common type of medically intractable epilepsy among adults; however, only about 20% of childhood seizures are originated from the temporal lobe. TLE can be treated through surgical procedures. Clinical characteristics of children undergoing TLE surgery including seizure types, histopathology, EEG findings, postoperative seizure, and neuropsychological outcomes may provide important information on the effect of surgery on TLE. The outcomes of temporal lobectomy was significantly better than antiepileptic drugs (AED) treatment. Therefore, it is recommended to postpone presurgical evaluation in case of medical intractability. Moreover, children with intractable seizures show intellectual decline over time; accordingly, surgery is the gold standard of treatment at earlier stages to reduce the severity of cognitive impairment (7). It is indicated that TLE surgery is a safe and effective method to treat children with intractable epilepsy (8,9). According to the results of the mentioned study, 58% of the patients in the surgical group became seizure-free compared to only 8% of the cases in the medical group. found that TLE surgery was able to keep patients seizure-free for almost up to two decades (10). This result was consistent with the results obtained by a study performed in the Cleveland Clinic. Another study conducted on 52 children and adults with medically intractable TLE demonstrated that 63.2% of the children and 72.7% of the adults became seizure-free after the operation (9). TLE surgery may impair memory, generally verbal memory and spatial learning disorders may happen following left-and right-sided temporal lobe resection. There is a greater risk for postoperative memory decline in patients with poorer presurgical mood (15). In a study with a follow-up duration of shorter than two years, no improvement of intellectual functioning was found (17). Therefore, a longer follow-up interval is required for cognitive recovery. carried out a study on the results of a nine years follow-up of 42 children underwent TLE surgery and showed a significant improvement in IQ after a follow-up period of more than five years in the surgical group, while the non-surgical control group did not show this increase (18). found the predictive factors of memory decline including good preoperative performance, left-hemisphere language dominance according to the Wada test, and adult age of seizure onset. In children, a safe and effective procedure to control seizure for intractable epilepsy is temporal lobe resection. Due to the shorter epilepsy duration and greater neuroplasticity in children compared to adults, the success in children is more probable. As a result, to improve long-term prognosis, early diagnosis of intractable epilepsy and referral for surgical treatment are critical. Williamson PD, French JA, Thadani VM, et al.

What are the different types of clinical seizures? Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery? What are the types of epilepsy surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means. The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria. There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus callosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator. In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications. Epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language. When our second child was diagnosed with a serious, debilitating illness called infantile spasms, it seemed that our dream would be dashed. The morning of her appointment with her pediatrician Eliana was sitting in her baby seat and she had a series of the movements in a row. Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy. For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of brain damage that occurred after birth. The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. For example, epilepsy could be a complication of infections in the brain (meningitis, encephalitis), head injuries with brain damage, brain tumors, or intracranial bleeding. The main line of treatment is with antiepileptic drugs, which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. If possible, the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. If this is not feasible, usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral. When antiepileptic drugs fail to control the seizures, the patients may improve with surgical procedures. Surgery is indicated in a small group of children. Since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with antiepileptic medications, surgery should be considered. Young age is not a contraindication for surgery, and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery, the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. There is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. As previously mentioned, surgery is only preferred once it is clear that the child is resistant to or does not respond well to antiepileptic medications. During the hospital admission (which may last several days) the EEG is recorded continuously throughout the entire day. The goal is to record epileptic events for further analysis. In some children it is necessary to stop the antiepileptic medications while the child is in the hospital to facilitate the emergence of an epileptic event. These tests are very effective to identify developmental abnormalities, brain tumors, scars due to prior bleeding events, or the presence of vascular malformations that might be responsible for the epileptic seizures. In some children, functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or ictal SPECT (an SPECT obtained at the time of the epileptic event) might also be indicated in order to determine the area of the brain to be excised. In some cases the localization of the epileptogenic area requires invasive monitoring. This procedure may be done at the time of the surgery or days before, in which case it requires a small operation and admission to the hospital for several days for continuous EEG recording. For example, operations near the motor area might result in motor paralysis; surgery in the posterior area of the brain (the occipital lobe) might result in visual deficiencies. In such cases a special test, called the WADA test, is performed to ensure that removal of the local lesion does not result in severe memory or language functional deficits. Once the evaluation is completed the team will decide if the patient is a viable candidate for surgery and in that case, what type of surgery is indicated. It is worthwhile to mention that not all of the above-mentioned tests are necessary in all patients. The actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. However, prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. The following are the surgical interventions that are performed to control epileptic disorders. These procedures can be done directly on the brain, (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), or by implanting a stimulator of the vagus nerve in the neck (vagal nerve stimulation). Resective surgery is the best indication for those children with epilepsy that is resistant to the antiepileptic medications and in whom a focal area of the brain was identified as the cause of the seizures. Most of these children have focal seizures rather than generalized seizures. In this procedure, the portion of the child's cerebral cortex that is causing seizures is removed. In some children the epileptic area is restricted to one discrete area of the brain, for example the temporal lobe; in other children several areas of the brain might be involved. The type and the extent of the surgery depends upon the size and location of the epileptogenic area. In some children resective surgery could be the most effective form of treatment. For example, in children with mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition in which there is a well-localized lesion in the temporal lobe, the resection of the lesion can result in up to 80% of patients being seizure-free. Fifty percent of children with extensive malformations involving one hemisphere may be seizure-free after hemispherectomy. Since the fibers that go from one half of the brain to the other half are cut, the communication between the two halves of the brain is impaired. By limiting the communication between the two sides of the brain the callosotomy prevents the rapid spreading of the epileptic event from one half of the brain to the other. The indication for this operation is rather limited, mostly to children who have frequent drop attacks, and at the present time is not frequently performed. However, the reasons for this improvement are not clear. The wire is wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck, and the electrical stimulator is implanted in a pouch under the skin in the upper chest. VNS seems to be effective in a variety of seizure disorders and epileptic syndromes. It has also proven to be effective in epileptic disorders that are resistant to antiepileptic treatment. VNS is indicated in children with epileptic disorders resistant to medication that are not candidates for surgery. What are the risks of VNS implantation? Some of the risks associated with epilepsy surgery are related to the presurgical evaluation. Many tests, as well as the different surgical procedures, require the use of heavy sedation or general anesthesia. General anesthesia has a very small risk of death. There are several risks inherent to the surgery, for example, bleeding inside the brain. This resective surgery may aggravate prior functional deficits or may result in new ones. These complications may occur even after very careful evaluation. In general there are fewer complications with callosotomies than with resective surgery. Yet, as in the case with all surgeries, there is always the risk of failure. In the case of epilepsy surgery this means recurrence of the epileptic seizures after the operation. However, even in these cases, the seizures may be easily controlled with medications after the surgery. A small percentage of children who have had epilepsy surgery experience complications, and even fewer have neurological complications. Therefore, young children with intractable seizures who are candidates for surgery are much better off when the surgery is done sooner than later. \"Seizures and Epilepsy in Children: Initial Treatment and Monitoring.\" What are epilepsy medications? Learn the epilepsy definition, symptoms, and treatment. How did your doctor decide whether to recommend surgery for you or your child's epilepsy? How has you or your child's life changed following epilepsy surgery? Although such treatment can be costly, multiple studies have demonstrated that ATL in patients who have failed at least two anticonvulsant drug trials (thereby meeting the criteria for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) has lower mortality, lower morbidity and lower long-term cost in comparison with continued medical therapy without surgical intervention. The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. Therefore, ATL is considered the standard of care for patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies. (1993) found increased electrophysiological abnormalities in sexually abused children. (1993) used the \"Limbic System Checklist-33\" to measure ictal temporal lobe epilepsy-like symptoms in 253 adults.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Worldwide over 500 million doses were administered between 1999 and 2004, and 575 million doses have been administered since the vaccine's introduction worldwide. Rates of disease have been seen to increase in populations that go unvaccinated. Side effects of immunization are generally mild and go away without any specific treatment. Because it contains live viruses, the MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be given while breastfeeding. Being recently immunized does not increase the risk of passing measles, mumps, or rubella on to others. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and autistic spectrum disorders. The MMR vaccine is a mixture of live weakened viruses of the three diseases. The MMRV vaccine, which also covers chickenpox, may be used instead. Medical use\n\nCochrane concluded that the \"Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR and MMRV vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles mumps rubella and varicella.\" Fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the U.S. each year between 1997 and 2013, and the disease is no longer considered endemic there. Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease. This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities. Mumps\nMumps is another viral disease that was once very common, especially during childhood. Administration\nThe MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection, the first dose typically at 12 months of age. Safety\n\nAdverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add \"difficulty walking\" to the package inserts. This report also rejected any connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. The number of reports on neurological disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events. A Cochrane review found that, compared with placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. published a fraudulent paper about twelve children, reportedly with bowel symptoms and autism or other disorders acquired soon after administration of MMR vaccine, while supporting a competing vaccine. In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\", and The Lancet fully retracted the paper. The research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the British Medical Journal. Since Wakefield's publication, multiple peer-reviewed studies have failed to show any association between the vaccine and autism. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, the UK National Health Service and the Cochrane Library review have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link. Before publication of Wakefield's findings, the inoculation rate for MMR in the UK was 92%; after publication, the rate dropped to below 80%. In Japan, the MMR triplet is not used. Immunity is achieved by a combination vaccine for measles and rubella, followed up later with a mumps only vaccine. This has had no effect on autism rates in the country, further disproving the MMR autism hypothesis. Enders’ Edmonston strain has been used since 1999 in Hungary in Merck MMR II product. In a 2012 study pediatricians and family doctors were sent a survey to gauge their awareness of the increased risk of febrile seizures (fever fits) in the MMRV. 74% of family doctors and 29% of pediatricians were unaware of the increased risk of febrile seizures.

These claims were initially proposed by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues, who hypothesized that the measles virus from the vaccine could lodge in the gut of susceptible children, damaging the bowel and causing autism. However, it is important to note that the claim made by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues has been extensively discredited. Numerous studies and scientific research have been conducted to investigate this claim, and no credible evidence has been found to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, it is crucial to understand that this study did not establish a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. It merely aimed to characterize these bowel findings in children with autism. Overall, the vast majority of scientific evidence and reputable medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), strongly support the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine has been administered to millions of children worldwide and has proven to be an essential tool in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. It is widely accepted in the medical community that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. He remained undeterred when a study by Robert L. Davis, published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found no association between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease, discussed in the Wakefield report, \"nor any evidence that the vaccine triggered acute onset of symptoms.\" Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable. It aims to increase the ability for the government to monitor health risks and the immunization process, as well as better the relationship between the Haitian government and international organizations within the health sector. Currently the results of this project are: 45.3% of children aged 12 to 23 months in project intervention areas are fully vaccinated, 45% of suspected cases of cholera are given notifications within 10 days, 72% and 77% of suspected cases of diphtheria and measles, respectively, were investigated and reported within 48 hours. Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. The crowded and poor neighborhoods of the city were at greatest risk for continued spread of \n\n humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
