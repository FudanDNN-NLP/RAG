with the exception of the third molar, also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age.\n\nA fully grown up adult will have 32 teeth in mouth, 8 teeth in each quarter of a mouth.\n\nWisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease.\n\nCompletely unerupted wisdom teeth usually result in no symptoms, although they can sometimes develop cysts or neoplasms.\n\nWhen a wisdom tooth is impacted, it usually must be removed (extracted).\n\nHowever, there are also reasons behind why you may need to consider removing your wisdom teeth.\n\nScreening for the presence of wisdom teeth often begins in late adolescence when a partially developed tooth may become impacted.\n\nSigns and symptoms Impacted wisdom teeth without communication to the mouth, that have no pathology associated with the tooth, and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth, rarely have symptoms.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease.\n\nSupporters of early removal cite the increasing risks for extraction over time and the costs of monitoring the wisdom teeth.\n\nAffordable cost of wisdom teeth pulling surgery in India encourages patients to go in for tooth extraction treatment.\n\nThe classification structure helps clinicians estimate the risks for impaction, infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal.\n\nSo for these reasons sometimes the smart move is to have your wisdom teeth removed.\n\nAnodontia: complete absence of teeth\n\nAn overview by India Dental Clinic and listing information of wisdom teeth removal treatment surgery centers in India and maxillofacial dental surgery hospitals performing impacted wisdom tooth extractions in India.\n\nSupporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone.\n\nIn some cases your wisdom teeth are in fact healthy, but because of orthodontic treatment they need to be removed.\n\nWisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth.\n\nSuch grown up adults who did not get the wisdom teeth extraction done during adolescence may also have them removed.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption, and the amount of soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them.\n\nWisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry.\n\nThere are other more unusual reasons why wisdom teeth are removed in hospit such cysts, tumours, and fractures of the jaw in this region.\n\nIf healthy and functional your wisdom teeth can be useful.\n\nWisdom teeth become impacted because of mismatch between the size of teeth and the size of the jaw.\n\nRemoval of impacted wisdom teeth is ad in the case of certain pathologies, such nonrestor caries or cysts.\n\nIn some cases, wisdom teeth emer normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms.\n\nIt was the meeting of ster technique radiology, and anesthesia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that allowed more routine management of impacted wisdom teeth.\n\nImpacted

        "context": "As for all adult teeth, they erupt between the ages 6 to 14, with the exception of the third molar, also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age.\n\nA fully grown up adult will have 32 teeth in mouth, 8 teeth in each quarter of a mouth.\n\nWisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease.\n\nCompletely unerupted wisdom teeth usually result in no symptoms, although they can sometimes develop cysts or neoplasms.\n\nWhen a wisdom tooth is impacted, it usually must be removed (extracted).\n\nHowever, there are also reasons behind why you may need to consider removing your wisdom teeth.\n\nScreening for the presence of wisdom teeth often begins in late adolescence when a partially developed tooth may become impacted.\n\nSigns and symptoms Impacted wisdom teeth without communication to the mouth, that have no pathology associated with the tooth, and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth, rarely have symptoms.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease.\n\nSupporters of early removal cite the increasing risks for extraction over time and the costs of monitoring the wisdom teeth.\n\nAffordable cost of wisdom teeth pulling surgery in India encourages patients to go in for tooth extraction treatment.\n\nThe classification structure helps clinicians estimate the risks for impaction, infections and complications associated with wisdom teeth removal.\n\nSo for these reasons sometimes the smart move is to have your wisdom teeth removed.\n\nAnodontia: complete absence of teeth\n\nAn overview by India Dental Clinic and listing information of wisdom teeth removal treatment surgery centers in India and maxillofacial dental surgery hospitals performing impacted wisdom tooth extractions in India.\n\nSupporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone.\n\nIn some cases your wisdom teeth are in fact healthy, but because of orthodontic treatment they need to be removed.\n\nWisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth.\n\nSuch grown up adults who did not get the wisdom teeth extraction done during adolescence may also have them removed.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption, and the amount of soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them.\n\nWisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry.\n\nThere are other more unusual reasons why wisdom teeth are removed in hospit such cysts, tumours, and fractures of the jaw in this region.\n\nIf healthy and functional your wisdom teeth can be useful.\n\nWisdom teeth become impacted because of mismatch between the size of teeth and the size of the jaw.\n\nRemoval of impacted wisdom teeth is ad in the case of certain pathologies, such nonrestor caries or cysts.\n\nIn some cases, wisdom teeth emer normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms.\n\nIt was the meeting of ster technique radiology, and anesthesia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that allowed more routine management of impacted wisdom teeth.\n\nImpacted wisdom teeth are often by direction of impaction tilting,ioangular being the most common), the depth of impaction
