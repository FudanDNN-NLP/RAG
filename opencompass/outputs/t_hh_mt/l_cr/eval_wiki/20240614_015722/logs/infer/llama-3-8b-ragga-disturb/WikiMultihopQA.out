Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story.

The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture.

Irons also developed an "internal way" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for "different energy points", giving each character his own appearance.

It was followed by Bergman's thematically related 1963 films Winter Light and The Silence.

In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because "it is hard enough to play one role".

When Margaret's father, the Count of Flanders, died in 1384, she and Philip inherited the counties of Artois, Burgundy, Flanders, Nevers, and Rethel.

With her death, the House of Dampierre came to an end, and the County of Flanders lost its (relative) independence to Burgundy.

and when his-in-law Count Louis II of Flanders died in 1384, succeeded him not only in the French counties of Flanders, Artois, Rethel, and Nevers, but also in the Free County of Burgundy, becoming a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.
