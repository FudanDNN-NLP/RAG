Works84 include besides this concer, the five piano9 Quint E foriano and W, several piano the Sonata in C minor being the most noteworthy—one string quartet (the "Hunt"), and several sets of orchestral dances.

The concerto is primarily difficult from its many quick scale patterns which must be played perfectly and also from its many fast chord patterns moving up and down.

M. S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the coda of the finale, starting at measure 315, from 2/4 to 3/8, and subsequent thematic transformations.

A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra.

In present-day upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal nations in the mid-15th century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca.

The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans.

The Iro League was to major European contact.

The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets.

Each tribe had seats in a group of 50 sachem chiefs.

These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy.

Examples preceding European contact include the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, the Blackfoot Confederacy, and Powhatan Confederacy in three different regions.

As their territory expanded, smaller tribes were forced further west, including the Osage, Kaw, Ponca, and Omaha peoples.
