The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications.

Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.

Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).

It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).

On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China."

It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.

Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.

The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.

At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.

A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial.

Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research.

Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors.

Eli Lilly has been forced to discontinue development of schizophrenia drug candidate, pomaglumetad methionil (mGlu2/3), after disappointing results in the second of two phase III clinical trials.

In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks.

Pharmacology Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics Clinical development of pomaglumetad resulted from efforts to discover potent and selective mGluR agonists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly.

President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: "I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research.

In 2015, Denovo Biopharma exclusively licensed LY-2140023 (the prodrug) for further development, having identified "a meaningful subset of patients who showed significantly improved outcomes".

A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial.

Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research.

Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors.

Eli Lilly has been forced to discontinue development of schizophrenia drug candidate, pomaglumetad methionil (mGlu2/3), after disappointing results in the second of two phase III clinical trials.

In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks.

Pharmacology Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics Clinical development of pomaglumetad resulted from efforts to discover potent and selective mGluR agonists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

Animal studies and neurochemical models have also shown that use of pomaglumetad augments the efficacy of known antipsychotics, predictive of potential clinical efficacy in schizophrenia treatment.

Human studies investigating therapeutic use of pomaglumetad have focused on the prodrug LY-2140023, a methionine amide of pomaglumetad (also called pomaglumetad methionil) since pomaglumetad exhibits low oral absorption and bioavailability in humans.

The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene).

LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first life-saving gene therapy for children, developed by Italian scientists and GlaxoSmithKline, has been recommended for approval in Europe, boosting the pioneering technology to fix faulty genes.

GSK is not putting a price on its product but a source close to the company said that, if approved, Strimvelis would cost “very significantly less than $1 million”.

The trial had several compassionate access patients and ultimately was expanded to 20 patients'' ; In late 2013 GSK exercised its option for the San Rafaelle gene therapy technology and is working with the Milan Investigators to prepare 

 the USA.

Its Strimvelis treatment for ADA-SCID is also being lined up for submission to U.S. regulators, although Andrews said this would not happen before the end of next year.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with A Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom matching bone marrow donor is available.

Trick may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis.

The trial had several compassionate access patients and ultimately was expanded to 20 patients'' ; In late 2013 GSK exercised its option for the San Rafaelle gene therapy technology and is working with the Milan Investigators to prepare 

 the USA.

Its Strimvelis treatment for ADA-SCID is also being lined up for submission to U.S. regulators, although Andrews said this would not happen before the end of next year.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with A Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom matching bone marrow donor is available.

Trick may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis.
A host of challeng need to be overcome, including complexity delivering product like GSK’ new treatment which bone marrow to be taken the injected.

Strimvelis expected to secure formal marketing from European in a couple, making it the second gene ther be approved, after UniQure’s Glyber, which tre disorder.

Martin, headxKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development.

Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development.

Under a microscope inside a lab at UT Southwestern Medical Center, a dish of cells pulsates with the rhythm of a human heart.

It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was 

 in JAMA.

Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease.

Stem cells may be used to help replace the damaged heart tissue and valves and establish new vessels to supply them with blood.

In a 2010 paper in the journal Cell, Srivastava showed that scar-forming cells known as fibroblasts could be converted into beating heart cells by adding just three ingredients.

The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs.

About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells.

In clinical trials, researchers have also used a third approach: They have taken so-called adult stem cells from bone marrow and injected them into the heart, hoping the stem cells take on the properties of muscle cells.

It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process.

In one approach, researchers take a sample of skin, fat or bone marrow from a patient, convert the mature cells into their previous immature states, then reprogram them to form a new type of tissue.

The researchers found that mice that received the transplanted cells survived in greater numbers than mice with heart attacks that did not receive the mouse stem cells.

The genes involved are the same ones that direct heart formation in the womb.

In 2004, the FDA approved the first clinical trial in the United States to test stem cell therapy for severe heart failure.

George Daley, director of stem cell transplantation at Children’s Hospital Boston and a past president of the International Society of Stem Cell Research, compared the effectiveness of the two methods in a paper published last month in the journal Cell.

What these studies show is that human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells.

In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss.
Each group used a combination transcription factors to reprogram the cells, but both found that technique improved heart function in the animals following a heart attack.

But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embry donated by fertility clinics.

The newly arteriesterioles and capillaries occupied 68 percent of the damaged portion of the ventricle nine days after the stem cells were transplanted, in replacing the dead tissue with living, functioning tissue.

To calculate LDL, labs use a formula known as the Friedewald equation, a more expedient way to assess LDL compared with actually measuring it, (which involves a cumbersome and expensive process called ultracentrifugation).

Accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is important because it helps assess their risk of heart disease.

In summary, accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is crucial for assessing their risk of heart disease and guiding appropriate treatment.

Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes.

These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome.

While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects.

In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients.

According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures.

Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups.

After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications.

Open reduction and locking plate fixation is the most commonly used method for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures.

Of the conservatively managed knees, 136 (30.9%) sustained a repeat dislocation, while 35 (22.3%) of those treated surgically experienced another dislocation.

Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus.

Surgery, however, was associated with significantly Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Scores (KOOS) for knee-related quality of life, daily function, and sports and recreation compared with conservative care.

Every 40 seconds someone in the world dies by suicide.

Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths.

In 2015, the suicide rate in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one seventh of the global average.

Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths.

While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females.

The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6).

Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years.

Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year.

What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism?

Childhood autism may be linked to a deficiency of fatty acids found in oily fish.

The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism.

Children with autism often suffer form mental retardation, seizure disorder, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.

In Scotland, an estimated 50,000 people, nearly 7,000 of them children, suffer from autism.

In an attempt to eliminate all androgen stimulation of cancer cells, some doctors use anti-androgens along with surgical or medical castration.

The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens.

I don't know enough about autism and the biochemical abnormalities to know whether serotonin is found too much, too little, or serotonin levels in autism are affected only in certain areas of the brain and whether supplements would help.

Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism.

When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration.

Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism.

The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression.

Autism occurs in approximately one out of every 70 children.

Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period.

If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism.

Anti-androgens.

The result is testosterone levels similar to those that occur after surgical castration or with estrogen.

Autism rates in Scotland have risen dramatically in the past ten years, a trend mirrored across the developed world.

In addition, anti-androgens can cause hot flashes, breast enlargement, diarrhea, and, in rare instances, liver damage.

This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time.

A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland.

These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace.

For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone.

Another option is an implanted drug delivery system (Viadur) that releases leuprolide continuously for one year.

Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Research in the area of supplement use for at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements.

Researchers injected orchidectomized (ORX) (castrated) and sham castrated male rats with BrdU to determine if the number of new cells was increased.

Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders.

Some doctors believe cycling therapy on and off delay the emergence these deadly cells.

Signs liver problems include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and jaundice.
HRH agonists are traditionally given as injections monthly or up to several months depending on the dosage.
Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from types horm therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients.

Friends began noticing how much he was talking with them not immediately retreating to his room when they came to visit.

A pilot study at the University of Stirling found children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells.

Another advantage ofirmagon LHRH agonists is that it doesn't appear to cause a temporary surge in testosterone levels at the start of treatment.

A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in metabol, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children.

But after a short period, block release of luteinizing hormone reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles.

Other side effects include nausea and vomiting breast enlargement, ED.

[2024-06-13 21:21:41,062] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine.

​When a new, devastating, and unexplained medical condition suddenly appears in large numbers like the microcephaly cases in Brazil, the first question any thinking person should ask is why?

​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination.

It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely.

Perhaps it is the MMR vaccine, not the Zika virus, that is the real culprit?

If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story.

Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic.

But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil.

​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika.

Pathophysiology In fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons.

​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit.

​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage?

A benign viral infection does not suddenly become virulent with no other explanation.

Stop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits.

​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese).

Diagnosis It is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas.

Diagnosis It is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas.

The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever.

Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin.

Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December.

Because a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source).

Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever.

Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI), also known as Cerebral Visual Impairment, is a form of neurological blindness that affects the way children interpret visual information.

This is potentially the case for children affected by aspects of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI).

In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine.

Blind Babies Foundation: "Unique Needs of Children With Visual Impairments" and "Pediatric Visual Diagnosis Fact Sheet."

While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes.

Fortunately, these children are more likely to receive an overall diagnosis of CVI, as their visual issues are more obvious.

Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it.

Look at other articles on this web site, and seek out relevant information from government and nonprofit organizations that offer resources for families of visually impaired children.

But if the child has been incorrectly diagnosed with one of those conditions, as a result of the similarities between visual perceptual difficulties and these impairments, or they have visual perceptual difficulties in addition to another impairment, the interventions being used may not be as effective as they could be.

However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions.

Despite having normal or near normal visual acuity however, many children are greatly affected by what is commonly referred to as visual perceptual difficulties.

It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition.

Although CVI has recently been recognised as the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world, the vast continuum of visual difficulties associated with this umbrella term means that many of our children are not being correctly diagnosed.

Not enough oxygen to the brain, brain injury, or infections such as encephalitis and meningitis can cause CVI.

American Federation for the Blind: "How Babies Learn;" "Setting Limits and Building Confidence;" "Education: What Families Need to Know;" and "Living With Vision Loss."

With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences.

CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them.

If your child' visual impairment is severe, he or she may need help from other specialists to develop life skills.

Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention.

Specialists in low-vision rehabilitation and mobility are trained to help visually impaired children adapt to their environment and develop independence.
