headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine.\n\n​When a new, devastating, and unexplained medical

of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic.\n\nBut I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil.\n\n​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika.\n\nPathophysiology In fruit flies microcephaly

aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit.\n\n​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage?\n\nA benign viral infection does not suddenly become virulent with no other explanation.\n\nStop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits.\n\n​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese).\n\nDiagnosis It is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar

Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever.\n\nNot only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin.\n\nSevere microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December.\n\nBecause a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source).\n\n​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil?\n\nOtherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash,

pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit.\n\n​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage?\n\nA benign viral infection does not suddenly become virulent with no other explanation.\n\nStop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits.\n\n​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine

symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever.\n\nNot only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin.\n\nSevere microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December.\n\nBecause a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source).\n\n​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged
