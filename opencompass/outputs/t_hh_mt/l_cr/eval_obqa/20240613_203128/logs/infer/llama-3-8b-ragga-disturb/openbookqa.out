You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

 The human cornea is a transparent membrane which allows light to pass through it.

Light is then refracted when passed through the cornea because it has a curved convex shape.

The iris in eagles appears yellow and functions similarly to the iris in humans.

The iris acts as a circular curtain to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye.The iris, lens, and ciliary body make up an anterior group of vascular tunic structures that modify the amount and quality of light that enters the eye.Note the outer fibrous layer (the cornea and the sclera), the middle vascular layer (the choroid, ciliary body, iris, and lens) and the inner neural layer (the retina).

The cornea is a transparent structure located at the front of the eye.

 The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first.

The iris acts as a circular curtain to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye.The **dilator pupillae muscle** is made of bands of smooth muscle that radiate from the inner edge of the iris (near the pupil) to the outer edge of the iris.As they contract, they pull the inner edge of the iris towards the outer edge and increase the pupil size (letting more light enter the eye).

The outermost layer of the cornea is called the corneal epithelium.

Endothelium: This is the innermost layer of the cornea.

The cornea is made up of five main layers, each with its own job.

This layer provides nourishment for the inner neural layer, as well as absorbing any scattered light rays, thus preventing light from producing multiple events on the retina.

The word corneal opacification literally means loss of normal transparency of cornea.

Its dense nature protects the rest of the cornea from scratches and minor injury.

The cornea is made of five layers, with the outer layer termed the corneal epithelium.

If the mice has the agouti gene it can be expressed due to the mother eating a typical diet and the offspring would have a yellow coat.

This information helps us understand the genetic control of hair color variation in different species, including humans.

To summarize, the role of agouti-signaling protein in determining hair color in mammals is to regulate the distribution of melanin pigment.

It's worth noting that loss of function mutations in the agouti gene cause black fur coloration, while mutations causing expression throughout the whole body in mice result in yellow fur and obesity.

When agouti is expressed, the growing part of the hair will come out yellow instead of black.

Loss-of-function mutations cause black fur coloration, while mutations causing expression throughout the whole body in mice lead to yellow fur and obesity.

It is responsible for the distribution of melanin pigment in mammals.

For example, in certain varieties of chicken, the allele for black feathers is co-dominant with the allele for white feathers.

When agouti is expressed, production of pheomelanin dominates, a melanin pigment that produces yellow or red colored hair.

In other species such as horses, agouti signalling is responsible for determining which parts of the body will be red or black.

As a result, mice with wildtype agouti display grey fur with each hair being partly yellow and partly black.

This interaction is responsible for making distinct light and dark bands in the hairs of animals such as the agouti, which the gene is named after.

Loss of function mutations in mice and other species cause black fur coloration, while mutations causing expression throughout the whole body in mice cause yellow fur and obesity.

In species like mice, the agouti gene encodes ASIP, which causes hair follicle melanocytes to produce the yellow pigment pheomelanin instead of the darker eumelanin.

This interaction determines whether the melanocytes produce eumelanin (brown to black pigment) or phaeomelanin (red to yellow pigment).

In mice, wildtype agouti results in gray fur color, where each hair is partly yellow and partly black.

As Hyman examined him the man's heart stopped beating.

We determined that the man had a genetic condition known as long QT syndrome.

The team continued to monitor the man closely.

The man was treated with beta blockers to prevent abnormal heart rhythms, and an internal cardioverter defibrillator, to restore normal heart rhythm in the event he suffers another life-threatening arrhythmia.

The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ.

We took a closer look at the electrocardiogram and the man’s family history.

The man had passed out two other times in a similar situation when he had a fever.

blood vs. other.

This process is known as cardiac tamponade and can be life threatening.

Effusions involving blood are often emergencies, because the blood may leak into the sac at high pressure.

The window will generally stay open over time, allowing constant drainage of the fluid to prevent accumulation.

Instead, the fluid compresses the heart, as the pressure inside the sac are greater than the pressure inside the heart.

The fluid is drained through the tube, and a drain can be left in if required.

In some cases, particularly when effusions recur, a hole is made in the sac to allow continuous drainage.

If there’s a sudden, significant increase in fluid around the heart, the sac doesn’t expand.

Instead, the underlying cause is treated.

If the effusion persists, grows larger over time, or causes symptoms it may need to be drained.

Second, doctors will drain fluid around the heart to test the pericardial fluid in a lab and determine the effusions’s cause.

Blood around the heart is known as hemopericardium.

This renders the heart incapable of filling with blood, essentially causing a shortage of oxygenated blood.

For example, if the effusion is attributed to lupus, the effusion will probably resolve with treatment of lupus.

Interestingly, it can be more dangerous for just 50cc of fluid to collect rapidly, than for 1 liter of fluid to collect over time.

The presence of an effusion may alert the physician to perform various tests to identify a cause and rule out more serious causes.

In that case, the asteroid is captured, entering a stable orbit around the planet which does not pass through the planet's atmosphere.

In some cases, these interactions can result in planetary systems with highly eccentric orbits or planets in close proximity to their host stars.

The size and physical characteristics of an orbit depend on the planet's mass.

, the gravitational interactions between stars can disrupt protoplanetary dis, which are the disks of gas and dust from which planets form.

The gravitational from nearby stars can cause orbitalabilities, leading to changes in the orb paths planets even ejections from the system.

In that case, the asteroid is captured, entering a stable orbit around the planet which does not pass through the planet's atmosphere.

In some cases, these interactions can result in planetary systems with highly eccentric orbits or planets in close proximity to their host stars.

The size and physical characteristics of an orbit depend on the planet's mass.

, the gravitational interactions between stars can disrupt protoplanetary dis, which are the disks of gas and dust from which planets form.

The gravitational from nearby stars can cause orbitalabilities, leading to changes in the orb paths planets even ejections from the system.

There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.

It is produced through the process of cellular respiration.

During this cycle, carbon molecules are oxidized, releasing energy in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2.

Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process.

Throughout cellular respiration, the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose can generate up to 36-38 ATP molecules.

This citrate molecule undergoes a series of reactions that release carbon dioxide high-energy electrons, and ATP.

It is important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
It's important to note production of ATP the Krebs cycle just one part of cellular respiration.
During cycle a series chemical reactions takes place in the mitochria, ultimately resulting in the production of energy-rich mole such as ATP.

NADH and FADHate their electrons to the electron transport chain, creates proton gradient across membrane

The final stage, oxidative phosphorylation, occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.

In summary, ATP is produced through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose, the production of energy-carrying molecules, and the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion.

These processes generate ATP molecules, which provide the energy necessary for various cellular activities.

In summary, one Krebs cycle generates 12 ATP molecules as part of the overall cellular respiration process.

Large-scale food production operations can pose potential environmental and health risks.

When heavy rains occur, the water can wash away the fertile top layer of soil, which is essential for plant growth and agriculture.

The negative effects of pesticides are not just in the area of application.

Runoff and pesticide drift can carry pesticides into distant aquatic environments or other fields, grazing areas, human settlements and undeveloped areas.

Additionally, surface runoff can carry agricultural fertilizers and pesticides into nearby water bodies.

The environmental effects of pesticides describe the broad series of consequences of using pesticides.

Surface runoff from farm fields during heavy rainstorms can have several potential consequences.

Over98% sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or entire agricultural fields.

Overall, it is crucial for farmers to implement sustainable farming practices that minimize surface runoff and its potential negative impacts on both agricultural productivity and environmental health.

Other agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, can also have negative effects on the environment.

An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.

These measures help reduce soil erosion and limit the amount of runoff reaching waterways while also promoting soil conservation and protecting water quality.

Subfossils are often found in depositionary environments, such as lake sediments, oceanic sediments, and soils.

Subfossils are useful for studying the evolutionary history of an environment and can be important to studies in paleoclimatology.

The term subfossil can be used to refer to remains, such as bones, nests, or defecations, whose fossilization process is not complete, either because the length of time since the animal involved was living is too short (less than 10,000 years) or because the conditions in which the remains were buried were not optimal for fossilization.

Subfossils are often found in caves or other shelters where they can be preserved for thousands of years.

In a hot and dry environment the body can undergo a process called mummification where the body is completely dehydrated and bacterial decay is inhibited.

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household's needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.

Wind energy is captured through the use of wind turbines that and transfer electricity for utilities, homeowners and remote villages.

Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy; has been in use for in Europe and more recently in the United States and other nations.

The stratum corneum is the dead tissue that performs protective and adaptive physiological functions including mechanical shear, impact resistance, water flux and hydration regulation, microbial proliferation and invasion regulation, initiation of inflammation through cytokine activation and dendritic cell activity, and selective permeability to exclude toxins, irritants, and allergens.

Stratum corneum protects the internal structures of the body from external injury and bacterial invasion.

It consists of lipids and helps to maintain the cohesion and strength of the stratum corneum.

The stratum corneum has a thickness between 10 and 40 μm.

There are several ways to improve the skin barrier function.

These components play crucial roles in maintaining the protective barrier functions of the skin.

For transdermal delivery, drugs must pass through the two sublayers of the epidermis to reach the microcirculation of the dermis.

[2024-06-13 20:39:20,881] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact.

In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns.

Thermal burns occur most often after an individual is exposed to steam, flames, or hot surfaces or liquids.

Retain their sense of feeling: Because burns tend to destroy nerve endings in victims, the skin may lose some or all sense of feeling, including touch and temperature.

In the event of a minor burn, or medically known as a first-degree burn injury, the outer layer of the skin, or the epidermis, is damaged.

Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin.

Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam.

Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns.

Prolonged exposure, however—on the order of 30 seconds—at temperatures above 45 C will begin to cause scarring, and above 55 C will cause extreme changes in the sclera and surrounding tissue.

In most chemical burns, the skin is dissolved upon contact and even vigorous washing may not rid the affected areas of dangerous chemicals, causing further damage.

Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20–30% of burns in children.

However, in terms of more serious burn injuries, such as those caused by second-degree or third-degree burns, skin beneath the epidermis are affected.

In United States, non-fatal burn injuries white males, aged <6 comprise most cases.

The sclera rarely damaged by brief exposure to heat: the eel provide exceptional protection, and the fact that the sclera covered in layers of moist tissue means these tissues are able to cause much of offending heat to become dissipated as steam the sclera itself damaged.

If left untreated, heatstroke can reduce body temperature rapidly, which is fatal, and survivors suffer long- disability.
Even minor burns hinder or prevent the from retaining its elasticity.

The heart is a muscular organ that plays a crucial role in circulating blood throughout the body.

The cardiovascular system circulates about 5 liters of blood at a rate of approximately 6 L/m.

The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature.

The area is smaller than the ventricles and has thinner, fewer muscular walls than the ventricles.

 The Heart, arteries, and veins (a network of tubes to carry blood) constitute the cardiovascular system or circulatory system of our body which transports the blood throughout the body.

The right side of the heart has less myocardium in the walls than the left side since the left side has to pump blood into the entire body while the right side only has to pump to the lungs.

Please note that the information provided is a general overview of the characteristics and functions of the heart and may not encompass all aspects.

It is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body and returning deoxygenated blood back to the lungs for oxygenation.

So, based on Casper's dictum, it can be concluded that decomposition occurs at its fastest rate in soil environments.

These microorganisms secrete enzymes that help break down complex molecules into smaller ones, which are then absorbed by other organisms or further broken down into inorganic nutrients that can be used by plants.

These decomposers play a vital role in breaking down complex organic matter such as dead plant materials, animal carcasses, and other organic waste.

It typically includes the bodies of dead organisms or fragments of organisms or fecal material.

Their activities contribute to nutrient recycling and energy flow within these ecosystems, supporting the growth and survival of various organisms within them.

As microorganisms break down organic matter, they release nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals back into the environment.

These nutrients are then available for uptake by plants and other organisms, contributing to the overall productivity and functioning of the ecosystem.

If your dog spends a lot of time in the backyard, give them a break from the heat by creating a cooling area.

During that time, the chamber is filled with up to three times the amount of oxygen normally found in the air.

The condition can be very serious, and may even lead to shock and death if not treated quickly.

A stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, occurs when the blood supply to an animal's brain is lower than it should be.

It needs blood to deliver nutrients and oxygen, as well as to remove waste.

Swimmer puppies are also often lethargic.

You can bring their body temp back down by removing them from the hot environment, placing them in an air-conditioned space, putting cool or room temperature on their body, and placing ice packs on their neck, armpits, and groin areas.

There are various types of microscopes, including electron microscopes, optical microscopes, scanning microscopes and others.

A microscope is similar in layout to a telescope except that the object being viewed is close to the objective, which is usually much smaller than the eyepiece.

For instance, transmission electron microscopes (TEM) can magnify samples up to millions of times.

Chemical fixation, cryofixation, dehydration, sectioning, staining, and ion beam million are some of the techniques employed on specimens before being magnified.

On the other hand, non-optical microscopes differ from optical microscopes in several ways:
1.

They are the oldest and simplest form of microscopes.

The simplest light microscope uses a single magnifying lens.

It helps further magnify the specimen and allows the viewer to see a detailed image.

Microscopes are employed in various fields of science and medicine to study objects in greater detail.

The microscope can be plugged into a computer the magnified image viewed directly on the screen.

They allow magnifications of up to one million times the size of a specimen while optical microscopes can achieve a magnification of no greater than 1000x.

The skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs in several ways.

Additionally, the skeleton provides a framework for the attachment of skeletal muscles through tendons, as well as the attachment of ligaments.

Without the skeletal system's protective function, injuries to these areas could have more severe consequences.

Additionally, the skeletal system plays a vital role in facilitating movement.

For example, the skull protects the brain, the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs, and the spinal column shields the spinal cord.

The skeletal system provides support and protection to the body's internal organs in several ways.

Additionally, the skeleton provides a framework for the attachment of skeletal muscles through tendons, as well as the attachment of ligaments.

Without the skeletal system's protective function, injuries to these areas could have more severe consequences.

Additionally, the skeletal system plays a vital role in facilitating movement.

For example, the skull protects the brain, the ribcage safeguards the heart and lungs, and the spinal column shields the spinal cord.

When a person comes into contact with a lightning strike or a conducting object hit by lightning, the electrical current can pass through their body.

Side splash makes up about a third of cases and occurs when lightning strikes nearby and jumps through the air to the person.

Prevention includes avoiding being outdoors during a thunderstorm, and sheltering in a fully enclosed structure (such a closed building or metal car).

It is safe to provide care immediately, as the affected person will not retain an electrical charge after the lightning has struck.

Ground current make up about half of cases and occurs when the lightning strikes nearby and travels to the person through the ground.

However, keraunoparalysis usually resolves within a few hours.

Lightning strikes can also induce a transient paralysis known as 'keraunoparalysis'.

Other physical injury can be caused by objects damaged or thrown by the lightning strike.

Lightning strikes are grouped in four categories: direct strikes, side splash, contact injury, and ground current.

When a lightning bolt travels through the air, it rapidly heats the surrounding air to temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun.

When a lightning strike seems imminent, a 'lightning position' can be taken by "sitting or crouching with knees and feet close together to create only one point of contact with the ground" (with the feet off the ground if sitting; if standing is necessary, the feet have to be touching).

This can cause electrical burns, damage to internal organs, cardiac arrhythmias, neurological issues, and even death.

Prevention 
Preventing lightning injury involves avoiding being outdoors during a thunderstorm.

It is dangerous to shelter under isolated trees, cliffs or other rocks.

In the United States about 1 in 10,000 people are hit by lightning during their lifetime.

In the United States about 1 in 10,000 people are hit by lightning during their lifetime.

Using sunscreen is the next-best strategy, and you should never wander far from your trusty bottle of SPF 30.

In sunscreens, chemicals like benzophenones, cinnamates, salicylates, and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, a compound linked to allergic reactions in some people) prevent sun damage by chemically absorbing radiation before it reaches the skin.

Sunblocks contain ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that lie on top of the skin and physically obstruct UVA and UVB radiation.

Sunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours.

Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin.

Soil acts as a source and reservoir for various substances and microorganisms.

Additionally, soil acts as a source for organic matter, such as decaying plant and animal materials, which contribute to the fertility of the soil.

As a source, soil provides essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, that are necessary for plants to grow and thrive.

When soil is depleted, it loses its fertility and ability to provide necessary nutrients for plants.

Furthermore, soil acts as a reservoir various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
It's worth noting while soil is home to a wide range microorganisms, some pathogenic ones, the transmission of diseases like tetanus primarily occurs through contaminated wounds rather than direct contact with soil.
 microorganisms help decompose organic matter, breaking it down into compounds that can be absorbed by plants.

Moreover,-based organisms (SBOs) found healthy soil have been shown to potential health benefits.
