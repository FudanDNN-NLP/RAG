nutrients and oxygen, as well as to remove waste.\n\nSwimmer puppies are also often lethargic.\n\nYou can bring their body temp back down by removing them from the hot environment, placing them in an

occur.\n\nThey will instinctively go to these things if their body becomes overheated.\n\nIf you're concerned that your dog may be having a heat stroke, pay close attention to their behavior.\n\nIf your dog spends a lot of time in the backyard, give them a break from the heat by creating a cooling area.\n\nDuring that time, the chamber is filled with up to three times the amount of oxygen normally found in the air.\n\nThe condition can be very serious, and may even lead to shock and death if not treated quickly.\n\nA stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, occurs when the blood supply to an animal's brain is lower than it should be.\n\nIt needs blood to deliver nutrients and oxygen, as well as to remove waste.\n\nSwimmer puppies are also often lethargic.\n\nYou can bring their body temp back down by removing them from the hot environment, placing them in an air-conditioned space, putting cool or room temperature on their body, and placing ice packs on their neck, armpits, and groin areas.\n\nOverview If your dog has anemia there’ s been a drop in the number of his red blood d blood cells carry oxygen to the cells in the body pick up carbon dioxide.\n\nIn
