You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

[2024-06-13 20:41:16,371] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands.

These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months).

A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an 

The main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR).

It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump).

Reference:
- Cardiovascular Fitness and Health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279206/

 Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities.

During exercise, the heart rate is elevated to pump more blood and deliver additional oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles.

During exercise, heart rate increases in order to pump more blood and deliver oxygen to the muscles.

An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.

By increasing the heart rate and cardiac output, the body ensures that an adequate amount of oxygenated blood reaches the muscles to meet their heightened demand during exercise.

There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise.

Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen.

This increase in heart rate leads to an increase in the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each contraction, which ultimately results in an increase in cardiac output.

There is also and increase in the density of muscle fiber capillaries to support the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide.

The maximum cardiac output increases as a result of stroke volume increasing a very significant amount.

Type II muscle fibers will experience an increase in aerobic capacity if the intensity of exercise is sufficient.

Oxygen uptake (VO2), which is the amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues, also increases to accommodate the metabolic demands.

This means that more oxygen-rich blood is delivered to working muscles during exercise.

Individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness tend to have lower resting heart rates and can achieve higher exercise intensities before reaching their maximum heart rate.

It's important to note while increased heart rate is the main reason for the rise in cardiac output exercise, other factors such as stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat) can also contribute to the overall increase in cardiac output.
Specifically there are significant increases in the amount oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute.

These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months).

A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an 

The main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR).

It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump).

Reference:

 Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities.

During exercise, the heart rate is elevated to pump more blood and deliver additional oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles.

During exercise, heart rate increases in order to pump more blood and deliver oxygen to the muscles.

An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.

By increasing the heart rate and cardiac output, the body ensures that an adequate amount of oxygenated blood reaches the muscles to meet their heightened demand during exercise.

Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray).

There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior.

While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions.

It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment.

Though all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur.

Calcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot.

Calcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination.

However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur.

A calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone.

In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin.

The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur.

The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot.

Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels.

For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues.

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs.

A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.

Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines.

Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone).

Once a calcaneal spur develop it can be a difficult condition to treat.
