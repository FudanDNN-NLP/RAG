literature in pre-colonial times, had been dismantled.\n\nIn 2008, Myanmar's new Constitution prioritized education after years of under prioritization of education in the previous military

Constitution.\n\nThe Shan State region of Myanmar has the lowest female literacy rates at 59.4%.Additionally while a growing proportion of women are pursuing higher education this number does not

curriculum called Anglo-Vernacular, was now taught in schools.\n\nThe literacy rate for adult women is 86% compared to just over 90% for men.\n\nThe President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) reauthorization, which is part of GHI, includes the goal of pre-service training for 140,000 new health care workers within five years in the recipient countries .\n\nHowever, at present, there is common uncertainty about how to accomplish this task.\n\nEducation is co-educational at all levels.\n\nMany Anglo-Burmese began to lose their jobs, to be replaced with pure Burmans as the bureaucracy

and 1351.\n\nThe Kingdom of France had the largest population of Europe at the time, and the Black Death was a major catastrophe.\n\nPistoia, a city in Italy, went as far as enacting rules and regulations on the city and its inhabitants to keep\n\n The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached Switzerland and Austria from Northern Italy in the South and Savoy in the West, and the Rhine and Central Germany from Northern France, and Northern Germany from Denmark.\n\nBecause the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian’s efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague.\n\nIt is believed that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries.\n\nThis was about 25% to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea.\n\nHistory The first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence).\n\nSeveral witness accounts do exist from the Black Death in the Holy Roman Empire, although they were often either written after the events took place, or are very short.\n\nThe Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe.\n\nSigns and symptoms The best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes.\n\nSecond outbreak Main articles: Black Death and Second plague pandemic In the Late Middle Ages (1340–1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population.\n\nSome historians see this as a turning point in European economic development.The term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word βουβών, meaning groin.The term buboes is also used to refer to the swollen lymph nodes.\n\nThe Black Death Paris is described in the famous chronicle of the Carmelite Jean de Venette in the Saint-Denis Abbey in Ille de France outside of Paris.\n\nThe Black in France was described by eyewitnesses such as Louis Heyligen, Jean de Venette and Gilles Li Muisis.\n\nThe Black Death migrated from France to Spain, from France to the Holy Roman Empire, and England ship from Gascony.\n\nTreatment Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague.\n\nPeople believed plague to be a punishment from God, and that the only way to rid of the plague was to be forgiven by God.One method used was to carve the symbol of the cross onto the front door of a house with words Lord have mercy on us.\n\n  The Black Death present France between 1347 and 1352.\nThe

is an infection of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea).\n\nAccording to Jean de Venette, the plague first arrived to Roissy near Gonesse in June 1348.\n\nQuestion: By approximately what percentage did the Black Death reduce the population of the region that the Soviet Union feared invasion from?\nAnswer:
