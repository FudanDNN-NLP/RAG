 When Burma became a colony of British India, Burmese literature continued to flourish, even though the institution of the Burmese monarchy, the leading patron of Burmese arts and literature in pre-colonial times, had been dismantled.

In 2008, Myanmar's new Constitution prioritized education after years of under prioritization of education in the previous military rule.

Currently, there are more women than men in Myanmar's education system.

Despite the fact that Burmese literature was well entrenched in Burmese culture, the lack of patrons to support literature slowed its further development.

Additional measures relating to the Burmese language were introduced so that to take the matriculation exam to enter Rangoon University, prospective students were required to be fluent in written Burmese (which many Anglo-Burmans had not been taught), even though all books and most teaching were still carried out in English.

English literature was still relatively inaccessible although both English and Burmese, in a curriculum called Anglo-Vernacular, was now taught in schools.

In his historico-philosophical studies, Mach developed a phenomenalistic philosophy of science that became influential in the 19th and 

Some of the influential figures in Hans Goldmann's life who impacted his work in ophthalmology were A. Cermak von Seysenegg, Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Konrad Lorenz, Karl Popper, Moritz Schlick, and Ewald Hering.

According to Mach, 

 on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries influence contiguously in space and time" (Berkovitz 2008
Mach's principle proposes that mechan is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular mass is expression of such relative motion.

His in that influenced Ernst's theoretical work.
It inconceivable in Matter should without the Mediation of something else which is not material operate, and other matter without mutualvity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act

[2024-06-13 21:15:41,020] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:FDA is directed to establish a system that will enhance its ability to track and trace domestic and imported foods.

This involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise.

It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur.

Certification for high-risk foods.

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011.

The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans.

It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system.

This allows the user to assess the impact of different decisions on food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs.

It provides a more integrated approach when making food safety decisions and aligns with existing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) systems.

The FDA has the authority to require that high-risk imported foods be accompanied by a credible third-party certification or other assurance of compliance as a condition of entry into the United States.

The FDA can refuse entry of food from a foreign facility into the United States if the FDA is denied access by the facility or the country in which the facility is located.

The FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities.

The FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships.

For the first time, importers have an explicit responsibility to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls in place to ensure that the food they produce is safe.

The FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them.

The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue mandatory recalls when companies fail to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to do so by the FDA.

The FDA does reference definition

The STARC Decision Tool offers several features and capabilities to the food for making informed decisions about food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs in the production of ready-to-eat foods.

Question: The owner of IPLEDGE has a food safety system know as what?
Answer: 
2024-06-13 21:15:41 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:FDA is directed to establish a system that will enhance its ability to track and trace domestic and imported foods.

This involves evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, specifying what preventive steps—controls—will be put into place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, maintaining routine records of the monitoring and specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise.

It allows the agency to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur.

Certification for high-risk foods.

The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA or Public Law 111-353), an 89-page document, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in early 2011.

The FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and those that firms will be required to keep to document implementation of their plans.

It enables the FDA to better protect public health and safety by strengthening the food safety system.

This allows the user to assess the impact of different decisions on food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs.

It provides a more integrated approach when making food safety decisions and aligns with existing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) systems.

The FDA has the authority to require that high-risk imported foods be accompanied by a credible third-party certification or other assurance of compliance as a condition of entry into the United States.

The FDA can refuse entry of food from a foreign facility into the United States if the FDA is denied access by the facility or the country in which the facility is located.

The FSMA also gives the FDA important new tools to hold imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities.

The FDA’s key new authorities and mandates through the FSMA are prevention, authority to prevent intentional contamination, mandatory produce safety standards, inspection and compliance, response, imports and enhanced partnerships.

For the first time, importers have an explicit responsibility to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls in place to ensure that the food they produce is safe.

The FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them.

The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue mandatory recalls when companies fail to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to do so by the FDA.

The FDA does reference definition

The STARC Decision Tool offers several features and capabilities to the food for making informed decisions about food safety, quality, nutrition, and costs in the production of ready-to-eat foods.

It provides a comprehensive approach and assists users in optimizing their production processes ready-to-eat foods.

TheDA issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including establishment of science-based mitigation strategies prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points.

according data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), every year about48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 in the United States from foodborne diseases.

Lore announced he had hired the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) owned by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels.

According to a survey conducted by The Real Deal, Extell is the most active builder in Manhattan, with at least 11 active projects totaling 5.7 million square feet.

The development is north of The 78, another large-scale development.

In 2013, Extell came under fire in the New York Post and Gawker Media for building separate entrances for rich tenants and poor tenants in one or more of their Manhattan high-rise buildings.

In May 2014, Johnson gave permission for the revised proposals to go ahead despite criticism of the removal of office space from the scheme in order to accommodate a larger hotel which will be Dalian Wanda's first luxury hotel outside of China.

Founded in 1989 by Gary Barnett, the company’s portfolio exceeds 20 million square feet.

The scheme, which is Dalian Wanda's first development outside of China, will be overseen by Wanda One - a UK subsidiary of Dalian Wanda.

The proposed land ownership in the city is inspired by Georgist principles, as advocated by political economist Henry George in his 1879 book Progress and Poverty.

He is Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at the University of Miami.

The company has between 125 and 150 employees.

The site was originally part of a larger development, dubbedRiverline" built by a partnership Chicago-based developer CMK and Lendlease but the partnership was dissolved in early 2018.

The project' planners intend for the city to be built on desert land, with Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, and Appalachia proposed as potential locations.

 The cake has a reputation as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was.

The Black Death epidemic first arrived in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter.

The population decline caused by the Black Death resulted in smaller taxes and smaller income for the elite, and a smaller work force who demanded better salary and better conditions from the elite, who reacted to the demands by repression and violence toward their work force.

Estimated to have caused abrupt death of 30 to 60% of Europe's population, it led to widespread social and economic disruption and deep religious disaffection and fanaticism.
