You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565

Tarik announces the "Fundamentalist Revolution", the "victory of faith over corruption", and demands one tenth of each of his hostages\' fortunes.

Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire\'s abuse of prescription drugs which he abets through his doctor\'s authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia.

Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck\'s tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to "synchronize" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck\'s that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone.

There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise.\nThe acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise.\nImmediately during the start of exercise, the cardiac output (Q) increases because of an increase in stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR). Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped in liters per minute, and is the product of stroke volume and heart rate: [Q = SV x HR]. Obviously, the heart rate increases during exercise, but most people don't realize that it actually starts to pick up right before the start of exercise as a reflex. The sympathetic nervous system sends an anticipatory stimulation to get the heart ready for exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. Stroke volume can increase up to 50% - 60% of the resting value.\nOxygen uptake (VO2), which is the amount of oxygen consumed by the body's tissues, also increases to accommodate the metabolic demands. At rest, VO2 is 1 met = 3.5 mL/kg/min. The maximum value for VO2 can be anywhere between 25 - 80 mL/kg/min, depending on age and conditioning level.\nThere is also an increase in blood pressure and blood flow. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the heart's contraction, and should increase during exercise. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the rest between heart contractions, and can increase or decrease during exercise. However, diastolic blood pressure should never increase over 20 mmHg.\nDuring exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization.\nRespiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. Minute ventilation increases through an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the amount of air inhaled and exhaled per breath. Essentially this means that you breathe deeper and faster during exercise. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs.\nAfter long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands.\nThe changes to the cardiovascular system include increased maximal cardiac output (Qmax), increased stroke volume (SV), and reduced heart rate (HR) at rest and during sub maximal exercise. There is also and increase in the density of muscle fiber capillaries to support the delivery of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide.\nThe maximum cardiac output increases as a result of stroke volume increasing a very significant amount. The increase in stroke volume is achieved from increases in the heart's contractility, elasticity, and chamber volume, as well as an increase in the thickness of the left ventricle, which is the space that holds blood before it's pumped out into the arteries to deliver oxygen and other nutrients. Therefore, the heart can literally fill up with more blood before each beat, at both rest and during exercise.\nThe increase in stroke volume allows resting heart rate to decrease. If the heart is pumping more blood per beat at rest, it doesn't have to pump as frequently to meet the same resting cardiac output demands. Highly conditioned athletes, for example, have resting heart rates ranging from 40-60 bpm, compared to the average person's resting heart rate of 60-100 bpm.\nThe more advanced capillary functions ultimately allow more efficiently delivered oxygen, nutrients, and hormones, as well as an increased means for the removal of heat and metabolic byproducts.\nRespiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. If the training focuses on the lower extremities, such as running, its unlikely that you will see any adaptations during upper extremity exercises.\nIf the athlete is training at a maximal level, then there will be an increase in breathing frequency and tidal volume, which is the volume of air displaced with each full respiratory cycle (inhale and exhale).\nAfter long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms.\nThe build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. Because there are better mechanisms for getting rid of contractile byproducts that end up slowing down muscle contractions, the neural pathways remain un-obstructed for longer.\nThe muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity.\nAerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned.\nThe onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) occurs at a higher percentage of aerobic capacity. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction.\nAll of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery.\nChronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. The muscle fiber cellular changes all contribute to increased muscle efficiency: increased myoglobin levels, mitochondrial size and number, aerobic enzymes, and metabolic energy stores (ATP, PCr, glycogen, and triglycerides). Type I muscle fibers experience an increase in aerobic capacity and some might increase in size.\nType II muscle fibers will experience an increase in aerobic capacity if the intensity of exercise is sufficient. There will also be less glycolytic enzymes and Type IIx will gradually convert to Type IIa, which are better equipped for aerobic exercise. While Type IIx fibers produce the most force, they're very inefficient and heavily rely on ATP and quick, low oxidative metabolisms. Type IIa fibers are known as intermediate fibers because they can use all energy systems and fatigue more slowly than Type IIx.\nIt's possible for an athlete to experience bone growth as a result of chronic aerobic training depending on the age and training stimulus.", " Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.", "The ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is influenced by several physiological parameters, which are closely related to cardiovascular fitness. These parameters include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.\n\nHeart rate refers to the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, heart rate increases in order to pump more blood and deliver oxygen to the muscles. Individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness tend to have lower resting heart rates and can achieve higher exercise intensities before reaching their maximum heart rate.\n\nStroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles.\n\nCardiac output is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. It is calculated by multiplying stroke volume by heart rate. As both stroke volume and heart rate increase with cardiovascular fitness, cardiac output also increases. This means that more oxygen-rich blood is delivered to working muscles during exercise.\n\nMaximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is a measure of an individual's ability to utilize oxygen during intense exercise. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles.\n\nImprovements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. Increased general metabolism leads to enhanced muscle metabolism and improved utilization of energy sources during exercise. The rise in haemoglobin levels allows for a greater capacity for carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. Buffers in the bloodstream help regulate pH levels during exercise, reducing fatigue and improving performance. Venous return improves due to adaptations in blood vessels, enhancing the return of blood to the heart. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery.\n\nTo optimize oxygen delivery to working muscles, individuals should engage in metabolic training, which includes both aerobic and anaerobic exercises. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume.\n\nOverall, a person's ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles is influenced by various physiological parameters that are closely tied to cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise and training can lead to improvements in these parameters, resulting in enhanced oxygen delivery and improved performance during physical activities.\n\nReference:\n- Cardiovascular Fitness and Health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279206/", "The main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR). When we exercise, our muscles require more oxygen and nutrients to support their increased activity. To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. \n\nOne of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. During exercise, the heart rate is elevated to pump more blood and deliver additional oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles. This increase in heart rate leads to an increase in the amount of blood the heart pumps out with each contraction, which ultimately results in an increase in cardiac output.\n\nBy increasing the heart rate and cardiac output, the body ensures that an adequate amount of oxygenated blood reaches the muscles to meet their heightened demand during exercise. This mechanism allows the body to maintain an optimal level of performance and support the increased physical activity.\n\nIt's important to note that while increased heart rate is the main reason for the rise in cardiac output during exercise, other factors such as stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out by the heart with each beat) can also contribute to the overall increase in cardiac output. The intricacies of these factors work together to meet the enhanced demand of the body during physical exertion.", ' Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.

DreamWorks Animation optioned the book to develop as an animated feature film, to be directed by Guillermo del Toro and Rodrigo Blaas. Eventually, Netflix greenlit the project as a high-end animated series instead, eager to work with del Toro and expand their slate of original animated programming. Rodrigo Blaas became an executive producer and supervising director on the series. Del Toro modeled the show\'s sensibilities after shows he grew up with such as Jonny Quest, identifying them as "really earnest and emotionally beautiful". To this end, he sought to make the main character of Jim "in that \'70s mold," and "really a very good boy" with del Toro noting that this was a constant struggle for him to express.

Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.", "Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. Initially, these deposits may not have any impact on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity.\n\nThere are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts.\n\nWhile calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. This can lead to persistent pain and difficulty walking or standing for long periods.\n\nIn some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. This can cause discomfort or pain when wearing shoes or participating in activities that involve ankle movement. In such cases, surgical removal of the spur may be considered as part of treatment for insertional Achilles tendonitis.\n\nIt's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan.", ' Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray.', ' Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. When stress is put on the plantar fascia ligament, it does not cause only plantar fasciitis, but causes a heel spur where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. The considerations that affect plantar heel pain are the alignment of the foot with lower leg, foot and ankle mobility, strength and endurance of muscle. External influences on plantar heel pain are the amount of time spent on feet while exercising or standing, type of footwear used and type of floor surfaces. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Flat feet can potentially be attributed to the minimal amount of ankle dorsiflexion during stance phase of the gait cycle causing more tension on the plantar fascia.', 'In the conventional or allopathic system of medicine there is no cure for heel pain or calcaneal spur or heel spur. In conventional medicine treatment is designed to decrease the inflammation and avoid re-injures.\nThe patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines.\nOver-the-counter or prescription of anti-inflammatory medications can help temporarily, but can cause side effects also. Prolonged use of the medicines causes significant gastrointestinal upset, ulceration and bleeding. The side effects of steroids injected in the affected area can be serious and can actually worsen symptoms. Complications can include fat necrosis (death of fatty tissue) of the heel and rupture of the plantar fascia.\nSometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. This surgery is about 80 percent effective in the small group of individuals who do not have relief with conservative treatment, but symptoms may return if preventative measures (wearing proper footwear, shoe inserts, stretching, etc) are not maintained.\nIn contrast, homeopathy is a natural form of medicine. In a typical case of healing, a person\'s complete symptoms will be treated all together.\nWhile prescribing a drug a complete history of the patient is taken which includes the medical history of the patient, physical and mental constitution and genetic predisposition to the disease.

However, the correct choice and the resulting relief is a matter of experience and right judgment on the part of the doctor. The treatment is decided after thorough case taking of the patient. Thus remedies are tailor made unlike allopathy in which all patients receive the same surgery or drugs although trade name may be different.\nA calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. It is caused by putting too much pressure on the sinew on the soles of the feet, usually over a long period of time. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot.\nSpurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the "bowstring-like" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel.\nNot all heel spurs cause symptoms. Some are discovered on xrays taken for other purposes. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter\'s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.\nCalcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Heel spurs are most often seen in middle aged men and women, but can be found in all age groups.\nCalcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot.\nPlantar fasciitis - "itis" indicates the inflammation of the tissue (plantar fascia) at the arch of the foot.\nThe causes can range from excessive walking (especially if unaccustomed to walking), running or jumping to improperly fitted or wornout shoes. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily.\nEvery time you take a step, one of your heels has to support the whole weight of your body. As you move, the load is equal to 20 times your own body weight. The load is softened by a pillow of fat under the heel and a large sinew under the sole of the foot.\nIf an athlete does not warm up properly or a person with a sedentary job exercises heavily during the weekends, they might overload the muscles of the calf or the Achilles tendon. These are also fixed on the heel bone. When the muscles of the calf or Achilles tendon are overloaded there will be extra strain on the sinew and muscles in the soles of the foot. The overload can cause inflammation and even small cracks in the sinew.\nEvery time you sit down, sleep or otherwise rest your legs, the muscles of the sole of the foot will contract in an attempt to protect the damaged sinew. The pain in the heel will then no longer be felt. But when you get up again the pain will return and when you move again, the sinew will crack even more. To compensate for the repeated damage to the sinew, the body will try and repair it in the same way that it would attempt to repair a broken bone, namely, by wrapping it up in bone. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. But it is not the spur itself that causes the pain. The spur is the result of a prolonged overload of the sinew at the sole of the foot.\nThough all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The pain is more in the morning and decreases with activity. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. The heel pain arises due to the spur pricking the surrounding tissue. The heel pain has been depicted as toothache in the foot.\nA sharp, stabbing pain under or on the inside of the heel.\nMost sufferers are people who are overweight and middle aged. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective.\nPeople who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Pronated means that the foot tends to roll inwards when a person walks or runs.\nCalcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on.\nOnce a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months.\nPrevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis.\nShoes are a must to support the arch of the foot even when at home. Arch supports and heel cups cushion the heel and reduce the weight bearing on the foot during activities.\nThe intensity and duration of activity and weight bearing should be reduced. Staying off the feet can help a lot.\nThe workout regimen should consist of mild stretches for strengthening of foot and calf muscles so as to reduce the tension on the heel mechanically.\nRolling an ice bottle under the foot can reduce acute pain. In chronic cases heat application also helps reduce the symptoms.\nLosing weight can reduce the extra pressure that plantar fascia bears with every step.\nIt must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs.'], 'answer': 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'}, {'classification_query': "Determine whether the given background supports, refutes, or provides not enough information about the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT', 'REFUTE', or 'NOT ENOUGH INFO'.

Eventually, Netflix greenlit the project as a high-end animated series instead, eager to work with del Toro and expand their slate of original animated programming. Rodrigo Blaas became an executive producer and supervising director on the series. Del Toro modeled the show\'s sensibilities after shows he grew up with such as Jonny Quest, identifying them as "really earnest and emotionally beautiful". To this end, he sought to make the main character of Jim "in that \'70s mold," and "really a very good boy" with del Toro noting that this was a constant struggle for him to express.

American rock band Weezer covered "Meri Kuri" on the Japanese version of their album Weezer.', ' Musically, "Automatic" is an R&B song that incorporates elements of pop, dance and soul music. A contributor of Japanese magazine CD Journal noticed that the R&B composition was a very "common" trait in Western culture in the late 1990s. Kano, writing for Rockin\'On Japan, agreed, and felt the song infused contemporary soul and club music. The writer commented that their experimentation with R&B music was signfiying to Japanese culture, as he felt the country did not emphasize the genre. Additionally, he noticed the contrast of their "painful" yet "innocent" vocal range in the number. In a similar review, Mori Tomoyuki from Amazon.com believed that the singers use of R&B "influence the country" and other growing musicians. In 2009, for the singers second English-language album This Is the One, there is a song titled "Automatic Part. 2", which samples parts of the English mentions from the Japanese release.

He felt the Affinity system was extraneous, however, and the new layout of the tech tree did not make scientific research markedly different from previous Civilization games. David Roberts from GamesRadar gave the game 8/10, praising the familiar Civilization gameplay, rewarding quests, and affinities, which change how players approach the new world's alien resources, but criticizing the game for being too similar to its predecessors, as well as the late game for being less interesting than opening turns. He also stated the game would be incredibly complex for players who are new to the franchise.

The result was hailed as a masterpiece, being the first game soundtrack to win a Grammy. Some fans of Civilization IV reportedly ended up leaving the menu screen open just to hear the global beat on repeat. When Johnson was asked if Tin was \'as cool in real life as he is on Reddit\' Johnson answered simply, "Yes." Civilization IV earned arguably the most critical acclaim of any Civilization game, with many fans believing it to be the best version of Civilization to date, even after two sequels.', ' One of the major features of Play the World was a "turnless game mode", a new concept never used in the previous versions of the Civilization series. The game mode allowed a sort of mixture between turn based and real time gameplay. Although the concept was good in theory, it rarely worked as intended and many online players experienced "Out of sync" problems along with others. Little support from Firaxis and the sundry other problems resulted in the gamemode not returning in Civilization IV. Play the World can also be found on Civilization III: Gold which includes the original Civilization III and Play the World. Civilization III: Play the World is also found on the Civilization III: Conquests expansion.', ' FreeCol released in 2003, is an open-source and fan-made remake of Colonization. It is under continued development. The 2008 release Civilization IV: Colonization is a Firaxis remake of the original Colonization for Microsoft Windows. It uses the upgraded Civilization IV engine and features the original gameplay (with some changes, particularly to colonist education), 3D graphics, an updated AI, and multiplayer support.', " is today seen as one of the factors that saved Civilization III and the future of the Civilization franchise. Due to his success in Civilization III, Soren Johnson became the sole lead designer of Civilization IV, once again writing all of the AI. For Civ IV Johnson brought in Civilization fans and members of the gaming community to test the game ahead of release, which proved highly effective in making the game stable and balanced before release. This set the precedent for his future development process, and continues to be part of the formula for developing his games.

Later that year, Johansson portrayed actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert wrote that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor. Her second marriage was to Canadian film-maker Paul Almond. Leigh had one daughter, Stephanie Leigh, also a dancer and pedagogue. Leigh-Hunt was born in Bath, Somerset. Her most famous movie role is probably in Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film Frenzy (1972), as a woman raped and strangled by a serial killer, that included the first graphically violent scene featuring visible nudity of Hitchcock's career. Richard Burton played the composer Richard 

 In 1962, she starred in the thriller The Manchurian Candidate, before deciding to scale back her career.

[2024-06-13 18:55:54,098] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about "mutant women" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre "gynecological instruments" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room. The next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. ", Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg." Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, writing "it's like a collaboration between med school and a supermarket tabloid", and said it was challenging but interesting for his female friends to view. Ebert also credited Irons for making each twin unique. Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. In The Washington Post, Desson Howe assessed it as "unnerving but also enthralling". For the same paper,  Rita Kempley called it "every woman's nightmare turned into a creepy thriller", adding it was "like slowing down to look at a traffic accident, afraid you might see something. It's really sordid stuff that becomes ridiculous, painful, unbelievable and tedious". It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. In 1999, Rolling Stone listed Dead Ringers as 95th on their list of "100 Maverick Movies". It was named one of "The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!" Dead Ringers afterwards ranked sixth in the 2004 update, and seventh in 2015. Accolades
Irons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

 In the show's series premiere, Colbert welcomed actor George Clooney and politician Jeb Bush, thanked former host David Letterman, and joined singer Mavis Staples and numerous other musicians for a rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's "Everyday People." Also, the show follows the same basic format as other late-night talk shows including the use of sketch comedy, guest interviews and musical performances. Colbert's guest list includes more political and government figures than his contemporaries; his first two weeks' guests included visits from Jeb Bush, Joe Biden, Ban Ki-moon, Stephen Breyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz. Thus far, Colbert has not had any of his staff act as a sidekick or straight man on the show.

The program is taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City and airs live to tape in most U.S. markets weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT, as with its competitors Jimmy Kimmel Live! Colbert was announced as the new host in April 2014, after existing host David Letterman announced his intention to retire earlier in the month; Colbert had previously hosted 

 In the show's series premiere, Colbert welcomed actor George Clooney and politician Jeb Bush, thanked former host David Letterman, and joined singer Mavis Staples and numerous other musicians for a rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's "Everyday People." Also, the show follows the same basic format as other late-night talk shows including the use of sketch comedy, guest interviews and musical performances. Colbert's guest list includes more political and government figures than his contemporaries; his first two weeks' guests included visits from Jeb Bush, Joe Biden, Ban Ki-moon, Stephen Breyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz. Thus far, Colbert has not had any of his staff act as a sidekick or straight man on the show.

[2024-06-13 18:57:58,459] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an 

The main reason for the increase in cardiac output during exercise is due to an increased heart rate (HR). One of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles. Improvements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume. Reference:
- Cardiovascular Fitness and Health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279206/

 Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood. The body, most specifically the cardiovascular and muscular systems, experience significant metabolic demands from just one single bout of aerobic exercise. There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise. The acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. During exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization. Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs. After long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands. Respiratory adaptations are specific to the exercise type and upper or lower extremity involvement. After long-term aerobic exercise, muscle contraction becomes overall more efficient, resulting in delayed fatigue of contractile mechanisms. The build up of limiting contractile factors, lactate for example, is slower after chronic aerobic exercise compared to those less conditioned. The muscles experience many changes after chronic aerobic exercise that can all be summarized as an overall increase in aerobic capacity. Aerobically trained athletes can perform at a higher percentage of their maximum aerobic power. They experience improved metabolic functions through increased fat utilization and decreased glucose utilization during exercise. This results in less byproducts that inhibit exercise performance and more time to fatigue compared to those who are less conditioned. The OBLA occurs at a point during exercise when the exercise intensity for the body to keep up with its lactate removal needs (think Lucy on the assembly line conveyer belt). Before this intensity is reached, the body is able to remove all lactate produced as a byproduct of metabolism and avoid early fatigue and inhibiting muscle contraction. All of these factors increase the aerobic efficiency and result in the athlete having more left over in the tank after exercise, which leads to an easier recovery. Chronic aerobic training also causes changes on a cellular level as well as changes specific to each muscle fiber type. There will also be less glycolytic enzymes and Type IIx will gradually convert to Type IIa, which are better equipped for aerobic exercise. It's possible for an athlete to experience bone growth as a result of chronic aerobic training depending on the age and training stimulus.

[2024-06-13 18:58:04,550] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:In the conventional or allopathic system of medicine there is no cure for heel pain or calcaneal spur or heel spur. The patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines. Sometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. There are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. A calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot. Spurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the "bowstring-like" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Calcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. Though all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective. People who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Calcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on. Once a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months. Prevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis. It must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray. Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts. While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan. A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.

Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a side-scrolling action-platformer in which players control Jim Lake Jr. or Claire Nuñez to prevent the Time-pocalypse. Players also collect artifacts, level up armor and fight fantasy creatures (trolls, dragons and goblins). Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a video game based on the popular television series Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia. Trollhunters has received critical acclaim and positive reviews from critics. The website's consensus reads, "Trollhunters manages to capture del Toro's enthusiasm for telling monster stories, in a youthful and more colorful fashion that may well earn him a new generation of fans." The second season of Trollhunters was nominated for six Annie Awards, tied for the most nominations of any television program in 2018. On January 30, 2017, Trollhunters writers Kevin and Dan Hageman stated that the series is the most successful Netflix original show to date that is targeted at a younger audience. Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (or simply Trollhunters) is an American computer-animated fantasy television series created for Netflix by Guillermo del Toro, and produced by DreamWorks Animation and Double Dare You Productions. It follows the story of James "Jim" Lake Jr., a teenage boy who finds a mysterious amulet and stumbles across a secret realm inhabited by trolls and other magical creatures.

Players also collect artifacts, level up armor and fight fantasy creatures (trolls, dragons and goblins). Trollhunters: Defenders of Arcadia is a video game based on the popular television series Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia. Trollhunters has received critical acclaim and positive reviews from critics. The website's consensus reads, "Trollhunters manages to capture del Toro's enthusiasm for telling monster stories, in a youthful and more colorful fashion that may well earn him a new generation of fans." The second season of Trollhunters was nominated for six Annie Awards, tied for the most nominations of any television program in 2018. On January 30, 2017, Trollhunters writers Kevin and Dan Hageman stated that the series is the most successful Netflix original show to date that is targeted at a younger audience. Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia (or simply Trollhunters) is an American computer-animated fantasy television series created for Netflix by Guillermo del Toro, and produced by DreamWorks Animation and Double Dare You Productions. It follows the story of James "Jim" Lake Jr., a teenage boy who finds a mysterious amulet and stumbles across a secret realm inhabited by trolls and other magical creatures.

For Civ IV Johnson brought in Civilization fans and members of the gaming community to test the game ahead of release, which proved highly effective in making the game stable and balanced before release. The 2008 release Civilization IV: Colonization is a Firaxis remake of the original Colonization for Microsoft Windows. It uses the upgraded Civilization IV engine and features the original gameplay (with some changes, particularly to colonist education), 3D graphics, an updated AI, and multiplayer support. Little support from Firaxis and the sundry other problems resulted in the gamemode not returning in Civilization IV. Some fans of Civilization IV reportedly ended up leaving the menu screen open just to hear the global beat on repeat. Civilization IV earned arguably the most critical acclaim of any Civilization game, with many fans believing it to be the best version of Civilization to date, even after two sequels. David Roberts from GamesRadar gave the game 8/10, praising the familiar Civilization gameplay, rewarding quests, and affinities, which change how players approach the new world's alien resources, but criticizing the game for being too similar to its predecessors, as well as the late game for being less interesting than opening turns.
