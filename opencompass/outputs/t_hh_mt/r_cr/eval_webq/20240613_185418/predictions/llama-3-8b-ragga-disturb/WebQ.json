He was the first meteorologist in America, the first geographer, the first oceanographer, an inventor of medical apparatus, and, least known of all, the first parapsychologist—a student of extraordinary and anomalous human functioning. It was in this last capacity that he created the blind protocol. In 1778 Franklin was in Paris, as America’s ambassador to the court of King Louis XVI, when the eighteenth century’s greatest medical rogue, Franz Anton Mesmer, arrived from Vienna, in a cloud of celebrity and controversy. Mesmer prudently decamped to Paris, which was where he encountered Franklin. But he also had a flamboyantly theatrical style and more than a whiff of the con; he had startling theories of illness and disturbing and erotically tinged methods of treatment. The sommambules sat holding hands around a large wooden tub filled with powdered glass and magnetized iron filings. They were relaxed and brought into rapport by the sweet haunting tones of the glass harmonica, an instrument invented, coincidentally, by Franklin. The effect was dramatic. It often worked, and Mesmer’s success made him popular with laypeople and feared by the medical establishment. However it happened, he seems to have sincerely believed he had discovered a cure for all illnesses. It is clear, though, that he had no real insight into why the trances worked. What was called for, he realized, was some sort of impartial test. It gave the effects he achieved a certain gloss, electricity, magnetism, and gravity being the high-prestige research areas of the day. We now know that he plagiarized much of this from one of the most prominent and well-regarded English physicians of the previous generation, Richard Meade (1673-1754). He also mixed in some alchemy, proposing that there existed a universal “fluid” in all living forms that could flow from one organism to another and affect a patient’s health. When he arrived in Paris, the French medical establishment, alarmed as much by his entrepreneurial success as by his unfounded theories, denied him a license to practice medicine in the city. He got around it by partnering with a disciple, the already licensed Charles d’Eslon. The four physicians asked the Academy of Sciences to add some scientists to their number, and five were chosen, including Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, the discoverer of oxygen, and Franklin, known throughout the world as the man who had discovered electricity. Franklin was by now arguably the most famous man in the Western world. Or it may be that whatever the condition of his body, his mind and his curiosity were as vigorous as ever. Franklin was not up to traveling when the commission began its work, so the first meetings were held without him and without his thoughts about how such an evaluation should be undertaken. D’Eslon explained to the commissioners that the tub was the condenser and conductor of the animal magnetism. He saw none of this as very useful. Among his other accomplishments, Franklin seems to have been the first scientist to consider demographics. On the theory that class and culture might help explain what was happening, and to allow comparisons between populations, the first session at Passy involved only lower-class patients, whose presence Franklin seems to have arranged. No cures were achieved. To this group were added Franklin, his grandsons, his secretary, an American officer, and a group of patients of d’Eslon. De Bory and Romagni felt nothing, nor did Franklin, the grandchildren, or the American officer. Franklin then suggested what became the first use of blindness and sham treatments in a scientific test. As Franklin had hoped, this was very revealing. D’Eslon touched an apricot tree in the garden with his wand, supposedly magnetizing it, and said that afterward anyone who touched the tree would be affected. Franklin, once again, saw the matter not as a question of belief but of getting unbiased evidence. D‘eslon was asked to stand several yards away from the tree. At the third he said his headache was much worse and volunteered that he felt he was getting close to the magnetized tree. Franklin and the other members of the commission in attendance were satisfied that the experiments conducted at his house, under the conditions of blindness he had devised, had settled the question of whether animal magnetism was real. Benjamin Franklin’s signature stood first, and such was his preeminence that throughout Europe and America scientists and laypeople alike felt that it had been he who had settled the issue. Although Mesmerism itself died out, the importance of Franklin’s blind protocol was not lost. In 1799 the English physician John Haygarth took the next step with the development of true placebo treatments. Haygarth refined the idea when he was asked to evaluate a medical device invented by a Connecticut doctor, Elisha Perkins. Like Mesmer’s treatments, Perkins’s were based on the manipulation of a mysterious energy. By the 1760s (or earlier) German artisans had invented a so-called \"pulse hammer\" (Pulshammer). In 1767 Benjamin Franklin visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it. Franklin's pulse hammer consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor. In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird. Benjamin Franklin was sufficiently impressed by a verrillon performance on a visit to London in 1757 that he created his own instrument, the glass armonica, in 1762. Franklin's armonica inspired several other instruments, including two created by Chladni.

In November 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One within a few hours of Kennedy's assassination. Succeeding to the presidency just about a year before the 1964 presidential election, Johnson launched War on poverty and signed Clean Air Act as his initial legislation. The 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson was a successful campaign for Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey for their election as president and vice president of the United States. Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right. Lyndon B. Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973) was the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969, served as vice president during the Kennedy administration. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, Johnson assumed the presidency. He also escalated the Vietnam War, which significantly reduced his popularity.

In November 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One within a few hours of Kennedy's assassination. Succeeding to the presidency just about a year before the 1964 presidential election, Johnson launched War on poverty and signed Clean Air Act as his initial legislation. The 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson was a successful campaign for Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey for their election as president and vice president of the United States. Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right. Lyndon B. Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973) was the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969, served as vice president during the Kennedy administration. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, Johnson assumed the presidency. He also escalated the Vietnam War, which significantly reduced his popularity. Initially, Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate, but soon after, Senator Robert F. Kennedy too challenged him.

This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima. Summary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Reports\n\nJapanese government report\nOn 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30). WHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants. A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. The Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer. , six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. According to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. Finally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster. The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.

In Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of The Hobbit (2012–2014), Thorin is portrayed by Richard Armitage. The film adaptation adds to Thorin's quest an arch-enemy in the form of the villainous orc leader Azog, as well as a history of enmity with Thranduil which began with a dispute between his grandfather Thrór and the Elvenking over the White Gems of Lasgalen. In his review, Erik Kain from Forbes wrote that Thorin stood out as a remarkable character with shades of dark and light, at once heroic and stubborn to a fault. Bilbo is played by Ian Holm, who had played Frodo in the BBC radio series 20 years earlier. Throughout the 2003 video game The Hobbit, the players control Bilbo, voiced by Michael Beattie.

These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. This system is relatively standardised, and could be considered a true writing system. There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants. Singapore, which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the de facto standard for younger ethnic \n\n Chinese calligraphy is the stylized, artistic writing of Chinese characters; the written form of Chinese that unites the languages spoken in China.

These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. This system is relatively standardised, and could be considered a true writing system. There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants.

Outer Western Carpathians 2. Inner Western Carpathians 3. Outer Eastern Carpathians 4. Inner Eastern Carpathians 5. Below is a detailed overview of the major subdivisions and ranges of the Carpathian Mountains. The Carpathians are a \"subsystem\" of a bigger Alps-Himalaya System that stretches from western Europe all the way to southern Asia, and are further divided into \"provinces\" and \"subprovinces\". To generalize, there are three major provinces (regions): Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians, and the Southern Carpathians. Geologically these ranges are part of the Outer Western Carpathians group of the Western Carpathians, and are composed mainly of flysch sediment. The mountain belt stretches from the Low Beskids range of the Eastern Carpathians along the border of Poland with Slovakia toward the Moravian region of the Czech Republic and the Austrian Weinviertel. The area of the Western Carpathians comprises about 70,000 km². range derives from the geological shifts that formed the later Carpathian uplift. The highest elevation in the Sudeten is Śnieżka (1,602 meters) in the Karkonosze Mountains.\n\n"

Some notable figures were Kussmaul, Quincke, von Recklinghausen, Müller, and Schönlein. These physicians made significant contributions to medicine and clinical observation, and their relationships with Virchow played a crucial role in shaping their work. In particular, Virchow's relationships with his mentors Müller and Schönlein had a profound impact on the development of Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen as students of Virchow. Virchow, as a mentor, provided guidance and inspiration to his students, fostering an environment of scientific and intellectual growth. Von Recklinghausen, also a student of Virchow, had a significant impact on the field of medicine through his contributions to pathology and dermatology. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of cells and cancer. Although Virchow made significant contributions to cellular biology and our understanding of cancer, it is important to mention that he rejected the notion that bacteria can cause disease and the value of cleanliness in preventing infection. His contributions laid the foundation for further research in the field of biology and continue to influence the fields of molecular biology and genetics today. In 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics.In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin.He pioneered the modern concept of pathological processes by his application of the cell theory to explain the effects of disease in the organs and tissues of the body. Moreover, he campaigned vigorously for social reforms and contributed to the development of anthropology as a modern science. In 1839 Virchow began the study of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute of the University of Berlin and was graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1843.

Its symptoms mimic those of other diseases (such as Parkinson's) and there isn't one test to spot it. Often doctors will rule out other diseases to arrive at a diagnosis. British physicist Stephen Hawking has defied the odds, living for more than 45 years with the disease. Hawking was diagnosed at 21, while a graduate student at Cambridge University. He has been wheelchair-bound since the 1970s. In 1985, he developed pneumonia and had to have a tracheotomy operation, which robbed him of his ability to speak. When a computer whiz in California heard of Hawking's plight, he sent him a computer program called Equalizer that could speak for him. Since then, Hawking has become known for the synthesized, computer-generated voice that enables him to speak. Determined early on not to let the disease steal his life, Hawking went on to become one of the world's preeminent physicists. He published the best-selling book, \"A Brief History of Time,\" and he has made great contributions to the fields of quantum gravity and cosmology. A Brief History of Time is a 1991 biographical documentary film about the physicist Stephen Hawking, directed by Errol Morris.

In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to \"combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\" For four years starting in 1982, Hawkings covered federal courts and city hall, was a metro section columnist and then an assistant city editor for the San Antonio Light.\n\nQuestion: what did stephen hawking become famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dutch is a monocentric language, at least what concerns its written form, with all speakers using the same standard form (authorized by the Dutch Language Union) based on a Dutch orthography defined in the so-called \"Green Booklet\" authoritative dictionary and \n\n Wallonia; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. 1%) and the ; geographically defined Regions (federated States: Brussels-Capital (de facto Greater Brussels), Flanders and Wallonia). 20% Dutch with the city being an enclave of the Flemish region and officially a bilingual area. ; Due to its relatively small size (approximately one percent) the German-speaking Community \n\n French was the only official language of Belgium until 1898, even though Flanders was and still is predominantly Dutch-speaking. The 1898 Equality Law made Dutch an official language of Belgium, but it did not become the sole official language of Flanders until 1921. While a Walloon industrial and mining base developed during the 19th century, the largely agrarian Flanders area \n\n As no census exists, there are no official statistics on Belgium's three official languages or their dialects. An estimated 59% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as Flemish), and French is spoken by 40%. Total Dutch speakers number 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers comprise 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (85%) of the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.\n\n"

The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans.

By virtue of their location, the tribes wielded considerable influence in European–Indian relations from the early seventeenth century onwards. The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets.

It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the United States government. The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans. As their territory expanded, smaller tribes were forced further west, including the Osage, Kaw, Ponca, and Omaha peoples. By virtue of their location, the tribes wielded considerable influence in European–Indian relations from the early seventeenth century onwards. The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River. The Iroquois Confederation led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely Algonquian-speaking tribes and Iroquoian-speaking Huron and related tribes of the Great Lakes region.\n\n"

Originally bred for bull-fighting. (See also MINIATURE BULL TERRIER DOGS; PIT BULL TERRIERS; STAFFORDSHIRE BULL TERRIERS.) The Boxer is a medium to large, short-haired breed of dog, developed in Germany. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group. The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. According to the AKC's website, though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed in the United States. Pit bull is a term used in the United States for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other countries such as the United Kingdom the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed. Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other countries including Britain, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier \n\n Bullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in England in the mid-1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers.

The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group. The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year.

Pit bull is a term used in the United States for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other countries such as the United Kingdom the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed. Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds.

The Flemish movement has inspired the growth of Flemish nationalist political parties such as the Volksunie (People's Union) which split into different parties including the Vlaams Blok (succeeded by the Vlaams Belang), the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and FlemishProgressives. The sense of \"Flemish\" identity increased significantly after the Belgian Revolution.

The contemporary region of Flanders comprises a part of this historical county, as well as parts of the medieval duchy of Brabant and the medieval county of Loon, where the modern Flemish ethnic group and culture gradually formed.\n\n"

Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship.

Aristotle introduced what may be called a scientific method. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: empiricism. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.\n\n"

In late 1944, these raids were followed by a major strategic bombing of cities, factories, and other war infrastructure throughout Japan, most notably: The air raids resulted in heavy damage to Japanese infrastructure and the deaths of 241,000–900,000 Japanese citizens (mostly civilians), as well as the loss thousands of aircraft and flak guns.

As Kaitlyn hides she continues to experience more terrifying supernatural phenomena, prompting her and Naida to travel to London to see her brother Haji, a powerful dark magician that gives them some information about their situation. Naida believes that Kaitlyn has been possessed by an evil spirit and ultimately decides to hold a ritual to travel into her mind, into the dead house itself. Sometime after \n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. Medical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections. Suspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him. Flasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Since 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. The next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan. Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. In popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Television\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.

Flasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Since 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. The next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan. Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. In popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Television\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. Medical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections. Suspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding.

Sometime after \n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier.

Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. In popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Television\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. Medical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections. Suspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him. Flasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Since 2001, Gypsy had attended science fiction and fantasy conventions, sometimes in costume, since she could blend in, even in her wheelchair. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. The next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan. Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated.

Late one evening this spring a frantic call came from a father who had heard of the last case. The hospital people would not co-operate at all, so she was taken home ; almost died on arrival but revived with oxygen and Kali-bi. set this right within a few hours.

While at Oakwood, Freeman founded the Progressive Black Caucus. Freeman's early influences were gospel singer Tye Tribbett and actress Tasha Smith; he said that they helped him \"see excellence in other ways\". After shadowing the president of Oakwood, Delbert Baker, Freeman decided to go into field of higher education, with the goal of becoming a university president. He earned a master's degree in 2008 and a PhD in higher education administration in 2011 from Auburn University.

Although relatively safe, when traveling to anywhere in the world, I would advise taking certain precautions in the unlikely event something unexpected happens while abroad. Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home. Bring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. Medical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. PassportAll travelers are required to have a valid passport (http: //travel.state.gov/passport). If you do not have a passport, get one quickly. Check the expiration date to make sure your passport is valid at least 6 months beyond your return date to the US and that there are blank pages available for entry/departure stamps. Be sure to have your passport with you during travel to and from Peru, although a Visa is not necessary. Make sure you notify your bank of travels before you leave, and make a copy of all your cards to store with your passport copy while traveling. I’ve had an ATM eat my card more than once while traveling, and in many small shops/towns, credit cards are a bit harder to use and will be harder to use as a primary means of currency.Also, it is a good idea to leave copies of such important documents with someone you trust at home in case of emergency. Leave a rough itinerary with someone you trust at home, and keep in touch with them throughout your trip. Getting to Cusco can be difficult, and most travelers will first arrive in Lima, Peru in route to Cusco. Due to flight schedules, it is likely you may spend a night, or at least several hours in this airport. Some people chose to sleep waiting for their connection, but you are not allowed thru the security line until much closer to your flight time, so if you are solo, take care to be aware of your surroundings and keep your luggage close by. Many travel agents will be overly friendly offering tours and hotels upon arrival, sometimes rather aggressively. Although I cannot say much for the deals they offer, know that it is extremely easy, and probably more relaxing and cheaper, to find tourists offices all around Cusco and in most tourists towns throughout Peru. Collect your luggage and head into the parking lot to escape. There, taxis will be waiting. If you do not know where you are staying for the first night, the Plaza del Arms is the center of Cusco’s touristy area and an easy place to find a coffee shop with tourist’s maps that will mark several hostels and restaurants to help get you oriented for your first night. High Altitude:If you choose to fly into Cusco from Lima, the first thing most travelers will notice is the effect of the high altitude. Cusco is situated at 11,151 feet above sea level. Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival).Medication Options: Diamox (acetazolamide)- Altitude sickness, Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival). Attire:Cusco is in the mountains and the average temperature during the daytime is 60° F and 40° F during the nighttime. You can check www.weather.com for an idea of Cusco temperatures before leaving. A raincoat may be a good idea, particularly if you are there during the rainy season (November-March). If you will travel to Machu Picchu, consider bringing a short sleeve shirt and shorts or jeans. The temperature will be warmer than Cusco with considerable humidity. Pickpockets:Although Cusco is a relatively safe part of Peru, common sense and awareness always helps keep you safe. Be particularly cautious for theft of money, cell phones, laptops, cameras and documents. Be especially cautious if visiting local markets or downtown Lima. However, always be aware of pickpockets, especially during festivals. Keep your bags/purses zipped up and if in crowds, in front of you so somebody cannot reach in and remove any of your valuables.San Blas: funky little artsy part of Cusco that is well worth a trip. Electricity:Because Peru uses 220 volts instead of 110 volts and a different electrical plug, an electrical adapter and voltage converter (transformer) will be required in Peru if you bring an electrical device from the US. Transportation:Taxis are relatively inexpensive in Cusco. However, if traveling independently, always take secure taxis or call one if late at night. Settle on a price to your destination before leaving or entering the taxi, most are slightly negotiable. Locals generally are willing to tell you the appropriate price. If taking a taxi from a hostel, ask the front desk owner to point out a secure taxi if it is late at night, and if possible, travel with a friend. Many are happy to help.If taking a bus or van to a near-by town, such as Pisac, try to find one in good repair, as these roads are rather full of twists and turns. Drugs:Any street drugs such as cocaine and pot are offered fairly frequently on the streets of Cusco. Remember that these drugs are illegal and penalties for foreigners can be harsh. Money:You may exchange money in Peru, but it is easiest in larger cities like Lima and Cusco. Bank ATM’s offer the best rates. Hotels can exchange money, but the rates are generally not as good. Credit cards can also be used in the major cities, but beware you may have to pay a fee or percentage for using the card abroad. If traveling to rural settings, be sure to have some cash in local currency (nuevos soles). Phone:Your cell phone may operate in Peru; however check with your service plan to assess charges. Local cell phones can be purchased quite cheaply in most markets in Peru, and you simply purchase minutes, as you need them. If staying in the country for a few weeks, this may be a great option not only for safety (sketch cab?

In Paraguay, both modern-day Spanish and the Guaraní indigenous language are spoken, and both are official and taught in schools.\n\n"

Meade defeated Lee at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1 to 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war and has been called the war's turning point. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). His men fought well in the morning, putting up a stout resistance, but as overwhelming Confederate forces massed against them, their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of Gettysburg to the relative safety of Cemetery Hill south of town. It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000.

In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. On the Prague phase of his journey, Beethoven composed an extended concert aria for the noted soprano Josepha Duschek, as Mozart had done on his visit in 1789. Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, about 14 years after Mozart (born Salzburg, 1756). In 1781, during Beethoven's childhood, Mozart had moved from Salzburg to Vienna, the Austrian imperial capital, to pursue his career.

Beethoven composed works in all the main genres of classical music, including symphonies, concertos, string quartets, piano sonatas and the opera. Beethoven straddled both the Classical and Romantic periods, working in genres associated with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and \n\n Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), German composer and pianist.

In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. On the Prague phase of his journey, Beethoven composed an extended concert aria for the noted soprano Josepha Duschek, as Mozart had done on his visit in 1789.

I step back when I think I might be going down a scholarly road that isn’t my place. Scholar #2: I think that holding myself accountable starts with my inner work. I’m the first to acknowledge that I’m a work in progress and don’t always get it right. Yet, I also want them to know that they’ll get things wrong too and that it’s important for us to learn together in community and work to get it right. These are all important practice that come to mind around holding myself accountable. Scholar #1: In my life, I’ve come to understand a few things about social change work. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, I really believe this. But I also think it’s imperative for each of us to figure out how we can get outside of only our own oppression and work actively to end another’s, lest we become a bit too myopic and self-serving in how we do the work. I can’t only, always, ever think about cis women’s oppression, though it is real and ending it is important to me. That can’t be the whole focus of my work, because then, I am only advancing myself and others like me. I think we can all do more to end oppression for groups we don’t belong to, and I think we must, lest we become so deeply invested in our own identities and their shifting power terms that we lose sight of everything else. Much of this is due to white supremacy and genderism. The intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and other identities becomes a moral imperative that should move humanity to take action. I think that’s a problem. Yet, I am aware that often they do. Gender-expansive praxis has the ability to correct that though, and that’s the work that I am committed to doing.

The exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" contributes to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, including their guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. The poem portrays the interactions and tensions between Christabel and Geraldine on a visceral and psychological level, rather than simply attributing their actions to supernatural or demonic influences. By examining the implications of a lesbian act in the world of \"Christabel,\" we can gain insight into the complexities of the characters. One aspect that stands out is the reversal of gender expectations in the sexual relationship between Christabel and Geraldine. Furthermore, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in the poem can also shed light on the characters' feelings of guilt and pleasure. Christabel, on the other hand, experiences pleasure in her interactions with Geraldine, suggesting a sense of liberation and self-discovery. The manipulation of gender roles and the depiction of lesbian sexuality also provide a contrast to the homosocial bond between Sir Leoline and Sir Roland in Part II of the poem. Overall, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" adds depth to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. It challenges societal expectations, highlights power dynamics, and delves into the complexities of human relationships and sexual identity. In his novel \"Midnight's Children,\" Salman Rushdie uses alcohol and alcoholism to delve into the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Rushdie employs alcohol and inebriation as lenses through which he explores various aspects of colonial life and the impact of British rule. One of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. Alcohol becomes a symbol through which the characters in the novel negotiate their identities and navigate the changing social and political landscapes. By using alcohol as a tool, Rushdie explores the conflicts and tensions that emerge as India transitions from a colonized nation to an independent one. Another way Rushdie uses alcohol is to satirize and undermine the supposed benefits that Empire presented to India and its people. By depicting characters struggling with alcoholism, he challenges the notion that colonial rule brought progress and advancement to the country. Through the lens of alcohol, Rushdie critiques the exploitative nature of Empire and exposes the contradictions inherent in its claims of superiority. Furthermore, Rushdie's exploration of alcohol and alcoholism allows him to delve into the medical legacy of Empire. He highlights the negative health consequences associated with excessive drinking and the toll it takes on individuals and society. By incorporating medical sources related to alcohol and inebriation, Rushdie sheds light on the detrimental effects of both personal and societal reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism or means of escape. Overall, Salman Rushdie's use of alcohol and alcoholism in \"Midnight's Children\" offers a multi-dimensional perspective on the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Through this literary device, Rushdie explores the complexities of identity, satirizes the claims of Empire, and exposes the health consequences associated with excessive drinking. Speak No Evil is a 2018 novel by Nigerian American writer Uzodinma Iweala.

Summary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Radiation release\nExperts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. WHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect. The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\" A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. On 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. , six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. According to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster. The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued.

His nickname, \"Mayhem,\" was given to him by his football teammate, Jason Teague. Matthews graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1997, and he was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 2002. Matthews was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, and his number 74 jersey is retired by the Titans. After retiring as a player, Matthews served as an assistant coach for the Houston Texans and Titans. A member of the Matthews family of football players, he is the brother of linebacker Clay Matthews Jr.; father of center Kevin Matthews and tackle Jake Matthews; and uncle of linebacker Clay Matthews III and linebacker Casey Matthews.

The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO's mandate seeks and includes: working worldwide to promote health, keeping the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, and collects data on global health issues. The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. Among the largest contributors were Germany (which contributed 12.18% of the budget), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (11.65%), and the United States (7.85%). The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Seven of these international conferences, spanning 41 years, were convened before any resulted in a multi-state international agreement. The seventh conference, in Venice in 1892, finally resulted in a convention. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. While Denmark, Sweden-Norway, and the USA did not sign this convention, it was unanimously agreed that the work of the prior conferences should be codified for implementation. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau (1902), and the  (1907) were soon founded. When the League of Nations was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. The ICCDE recommends to WHO which countries fulfill requirements for certification. 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis, and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The WHO works to improve nutrition, food safety and food security and to ensure this has a positive effect on public health and sustainable development. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. Reform efforts following the Ebola outbreak\nFollowing the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. However, Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, canceled the planned withdrawal and announced in January 2021 that the U.S. would resume funding the organization. Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981), Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003) the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010) as well as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and its pediatric counterpart. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. It also contains important international documents and information. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". The World Health Assembly is attended by delegations from all member states, and determines the policies of the organization. In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly, they are seated alongside the other NGOs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. It appoints the director-general every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. Director-General\n\nThe head of the organization is the director-general, elected by the World Health Assembly. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003. On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Country and liaison offices\nThe World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. Financing and partnerships\n\nPresent \nThe WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2020, the biggest contributor is the United States, which gives over $400 million annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. , the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million). According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through. The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty \n\n The United Nations oversees 14 peacekeeping operations around the world. UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. The United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and advocating for global health initiatives. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN. One of the ways the UN promotes social justice is through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. The UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. Through partnerships with various charitable and governmental organizations, the UN supports initiatives such as training local surgical teams and establishing specialty surgical hospitals. In summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all. United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan cover about 70 operations throughout different parts of the world. Pakistan joined the United Nations on 30 September 1947, despite opposition from Afghanistan because of the Durand Line issue. The Pakistan Armed Forces are the third largest contributor of troops towards UN peacekeeping efforts, behind India and Ethiopia. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. All operations must include the resolution of conflicts through the use of force to be considered valid under the charter of the United Nations.\n\nQuestion: what countries do the united nations help?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. However, Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, canceled the planned withdrawal and announced in January 2021 that the U.S. would resume funding the organization. Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981), Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003) the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010) as well as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and its pediatric counterpart. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. It also contains important international documents and information. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". The World Health Assembly is attended by delegations from all member states, and determines the policies of the organization. In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly, they are seated alongside the other NGOs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. It appoints the director-general every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. Director-General\n\nThe head of the organization is the director-general, elected by the World Health Assembly. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003. On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Country and liaison offices\nThe World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. Financing and partnerships\n\nPresent \nThe WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2020, the biggest contributor is the United States, which gives over $400 million annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. , the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million). According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through. The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty \n\n The United Nations oversees 14 peacekeeping operations around the world. UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. The United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and advocating for global health initiatives. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN. One of the ways the UN promotes social justice is through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. The UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. Through partnerships with various charitable and governmental organizations, the UN supports initiatives such as training local surgical teams and establishing specialty surgical hospitals. In summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all. United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan cover about 70 operations throughout different parts of the world. Pakistan joined the United Nations on 30 September 1947, despite opposition from Afghanistan because of the Durand Line issue. The Pakistan Armed Forces are the third largest contributor of troops towards UN peacekeeping efforts, behind India and Ethiopia. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. All operations must include the resolution of conflicts through the use of force to be considered valid under the charter of the United Nations.\n\n"

Before the Draft, Vince Lombardi would pressure Coach Bryant to persuade Pat to come to play for him with the Green Bay Packers after graduation. Coach Bryant responded, \"Pat is too smart to play professional football ... he will go on to medical school to fulfill his personal goals.\" He was a longtime assistant coach in college football and the National Football League (NFL), chiefly remembered as the successor to Vince Lombardi as head coach of the Green Bay Packers in 1968.\n\n"

Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs. Her work led to the creation of the AIDS drug AZT. Her well known works also include the development of the first immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, used to fight rejection in organ transplants, and the first successful antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV), used in the treatment of herpes infection. Early life and education\nElion was born in New York City on January 23, 1918, to parents Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant and a dentist, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish Jewish immigrant. Her family lost their wealth after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Elion was an excellent student who graduated from Walton High School at the age of 15. When she was 15, her grandfather died of stomach cancer, and being with him during his last moments inspired Elion to pursue a career in science and medicine in college. Unable to find a paying research job after graduating because she was female, Elion worked as a secretary and high school teacher before working in an unpaid position at a chemistry lab. in 1941, while working as a high school teacher during the day. In 1944, she left to work as an assistant to George H. Hitchings at the Burroughs-Wellcome pharmaceutical company (now GlaxoSmithKline) in Tuckahoe, New York. He believed that if he could trick cancer cells into accepting artificial compounds for their growth, they could be destroyed without also destroying normal cells.Elion synthesized anti-metabolites of purines, and in 1950, she developed the anti-cancer drugs tioguanine and mercaptopurine. Elion made a critical decision in her life, and stayed with her job and give up the pursuit of her doctorate. She never obtained a formal Ph.D., but was later awarded an honorary Ph.D. from New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic University of New York) in 1989 and an honorary S.D. Personal life \nSoon after graduating from Hunter College, Elion met Leonard Canter, an outstanding statistics student at City College of New York (CCNY). In her Nobel interview, she stated that this furthered her drive to become a research scientist and pharmacologist. However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had two sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. She retired in 1983 from Burroughs Wellcome to spend more time traveling and attending the opera. One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue a career in science. Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81. Career and research \nWhile Elion had many jobs to support herself and put herself through school, Elion had also worked for the National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research, and World Health Organization, among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for Burroughs Wellcome. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS. She also was crucial in the development of Nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999.

Lucy was accused by her son, Eutropius (or Euprepius), of being a Christian. She was brought before Diocletian, who at first attempted to dissuade her and then placed her in a cauldron of burning pitch; Lucy lived for three days in the cauldron. When Diocletian heard that she was still alive, he ordered her to be carried around the city, with weights loaded on her body. When Lucy was paraded by Geminian's house, the statues of Roman gods in his home shattered miraculously and a dove made the sign of the cross over Geminian's head. He followed Lucy, asking for instruction in the Christian religion as well as baptism. A priest named Protasius helped him with his request. 75 people were converted to Christianity by the example of Geminian. The judge presiding at their trial was thrown from his horse on a stone bridge; his body was never found. Lucy and Geminian were ultimately beheaded. They were buried by a woman named Maxima. Lucy was a perfectly healthy infant until the fall of 2011, when her parents noticed that the shape of her head was changing - a bump, a protrusion was forming in the back of her skull and her forehead was becoming more prominent. After extensive online research, Lucy's mom, Katie, came across a condition that fit Lucy's symptoms: craniosynostosis, a premature fusion of the cranial sutures between the bones of a baby's skull. Babies are born with incompletely fused skull bones to accommodate brain growth during infancy. In the spring of 2012, the Jenkins family came to Johns Hopkins Children's Center where they met pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. George Jallo and plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Amir Dorafshar. Even though craniosynostosis repairs have been done for many years, the Hopkins surgeons used a novel approach that ensured greater accuracy and precision. Before the surgery, Lucy underwent a 3-D head CT scan, which allowed the surgeons to meticulously plan every cut before they even made the first incision. \"When Dr. Dorafshar talked to us about it, I immediately felt that it was in Lucy's best interest to have it done. Lucy's parents even saw the computer models of Lucy's head along with the planned cuts and reconstruction. On Aug. 8, 2012 Lucy underwent a five-and-a-half-hour surgery. Thankfully, the rest of the procedure was uneventful, and Lucy went to the pediatric intensive care unit that day. However, when Dr. Dorafshar stopped by the PICU that day to check on her, he saw an alarming sign - Lucy's abdomen was so swollen that it was pushing on her lungs causing her to have difficulty breathing. Lucy had developed abdominal compartment syndrome as a result of the fast infusion of blood during the surgery. To release the penned up fluid from her abdomen, Lucy had to have a minor procedure, which relieved pressure and restored normal breathing. The only thing I remember about that time was hearing Dr. Dorafshar's voice, and that was all I could focus on. He was so calm and reassuring, and that was exactly what I needed to stay composed and to begin to focus on helping Lucy to recover.\" By the time, she left the hospital, Lucy was sitting up on her own, crawling around her crib, playing, laughing and talking.

Lucy Washburn was a fussy baby. That's just what kind of baby Lucy was. But when Cynthia noticed at 3 months what looked like a hernia around Lucy's groin, she decided to take her to the pediatrician near their home in Winter Park, Colorado, nestled into the mountains west of Denver at about 9,500 feet. An hour later, Lucy was in a helicopter rushing to Children's Hospital Colorado while her parents drove down behind. It was a frightening ordeal, particularly for Cynthia, who, as a teen, had suffered a meningococcal infection that came on suddenly, shut down her major organs and put her in a coma that lasted weeks. It left her with skin grafts all over her body. Doctors were forced to amputate her legs. \"My mom flew out from Australia when Lucy was in the hospital,\" Cynthia recalls. Lucy's condition stayed distressingly touch-and-go for three months. But once she was stable, they sent her home. Then, in April of last year, a routine blood test showed Lucy’s platelet count rapidly dropping. \"It's like a Ferrari someone cut the brakes on. Drs. Hence the anemia. Hence the low platelet count.

Veneration for them was ancient but their story is \"only known from fabulous acts.\" Lucy appears to be in reality the same as the Lucy of Syracuse whose feast is on 13 December, but the Geminian who was venerated on 16 September seems to be a fictitious character, not to be confused with Saint Geminianus, Bishop of Modena.

James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. To distinguish her from her grandmother, she was called \"Little Lucy Smith\" as a child, a nickname that she would continue to use during her gospel career. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer.

Veneration for them was ancient but their story is \"only known from fabulous acts.\" Lucy appears to be in reality the same as the Lucy of Syracuse whose feast is on 13 December, but the Geminian who was venerated on 16 September seems to be a fictitious character, not to be confused with Saint Geminianus, Bishop of Modena. Lucy Smith was born in Chicago in 1925. Her mother, Viola, died when she was two years old, and thereafter, she was raised by her father, Rev. James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. To distinguish her from her grandmother, she was called \"Little Lucy Smith\" as a child, a nickname that she would continue to use during her gospel career. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer. In two years she had become a skilled gospel accompanist,\n\n"
