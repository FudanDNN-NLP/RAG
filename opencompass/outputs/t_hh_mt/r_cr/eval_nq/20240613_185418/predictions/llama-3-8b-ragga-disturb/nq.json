Super Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots with the Eagles winning 41-33 for their first Super Bowl win. Despite becoming major playoff underdogs due to the loss of Wentz, Foles filled in admirably as the starter, allowing Philadelphia to make it to Super Bowl LII, their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2004 season. Eventual Super Bowl MVP Foles led the team in a 41–33 win over the New England Patriots, giving them their first Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first league championship since 1960. The  Philadelphia Eagles season was the franchise's 79th season in the National Football League, and the thirteenth under head coach Andy Reid. They also swept the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins for the first time since 2006 and 2009, respectively. The Eagles played all their home games at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win until the Phillies 2008 World Series win. The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987. After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.\n\n"

The eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time. The iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye. The cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera. Cells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished. The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation. The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre). Located directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. The vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away. The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first. \"The image formed by the cornea is upside down and reversed from right to left. \"(Journey N, 1997-2019) The layers of the cornea in raptors include the, Anterior corneal epithelium, Anterior limiting lamina (Bowman's layer), Substantia propria (stroma comprising the majority of corneal thickness),Posterior limiting lamina (Descemet's membrane) Posterior epithelium (endothelium). The iris contracts and dilates to control the amount of light the received \n\n Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the photons (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. This is called adaptation. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.\n\nQuestion: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation. The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye. This meshwork is located at the outer part of the iris, where it meets the cornea, in a small area known as the drainage angle. Its role is to control the amount of light entering the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil (the opening in its centre). Located directly behind the pupil, the lens is a clear, flexible, disc-like structure responsible for focusing the light entering the eye. When light passes through the lens, it bends (refracts) and focuses on the retina at the back of the eye. After passing through the cornea, the light rays pass through the pupil, which opens and closes to adjust how much light can enter. The retina is a layer of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells that line the inside of the eye. The retina has two types of cells called rods and cones. Light rays that have been focused by the cornea and lens eventually reach the retina. The sclera is the white, structural tissue of the eye and is continuous with the clear cornea at the front of the eye. The vitreous humour is a clear, gel-like liquid that fills the posterior chamber of the eye. The vitreous humour sits between the lens and the retina. In contrast to the aqueous humour, vitreous humour doesn’t move – it is not replenished or drained away. The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first. \"The image formed by the cornea is upside down and reversed from right to left. \"(Journey N, 1997-2019) The layers of the cornea in raptors include the, Anterior corneal epithelium, Anterior limiting lamina (Bowman's layer), Substantia propria (stroma comprising the majority of corneal thickness),Posterior limiting lamina (Descemet's membrane) Posterior epithelium (endothelium). The iris contracts and dilates to control the amount of light the received \n\n Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the photons (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. This is called adaptation. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.\n\n"

Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name \"gallstone ileus\" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone). Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat. Food entering the stomach stimulates the production of the chemical cholecystokinin, which causes the gall bladder to release bile into the small intestine through a sphincter known as the ampulla of Vater.

After the backdoor pilot of Chicago Med, he decided to switch specialties to emergency medicine. They eventually call an unspoken truce by the end of the season as they developed a mutual professional respect for one another. He also earns the ire of attending Dr. Kendra Perrington in the episode \"Inheritance\" for overriding her at the request of the patient's brother, who was his former schoolmate, only to find out that she was on the hiring committee. For much of early season 2, he stresses out over his finances as he still had to pay off his student loans and sizeable malpractice insurance (due to his malpractice suit from the episode \"Clarity\"). He initially sees final year medical student Jeff Clarke as a rival for Natalie's affections but develops a friendship with Clarke and often encourages him. During the first season, Dr. Halstead had feelings for the pediatric emergency medicine fellow, Dr. Natalie Manning, who was then pregnant with her late husband's baby. It caused some awkwardness as her mother-in-law (portrayed by actress Annie Potts) was extremely protective and initially viewed him with suspicion. They move in together in the season 2 episode \"Free Will\". They break up in finale of season 2 because he still has feelings for Dr. Manning. In season 4 they prepare for their wedding but Dr. Halstead finds himself in a difficult position when a neighborhood friend he made a house call to turns out to be federally listed criminal wanted by both the CPD and FBI. His brother convinces him to continue making the house calls in order to feed information to the joint CPD-FBI task force. Jay still has some lingering bitterness over the fact that Will was not around when their late mother was ill (she died of cancer). Natalie was widowed when her husband, Jeff, a soldier, was killed in Afghanistan and gave birth to their son, Owen. She is revealed to be a skilled  violinist, as seen in season 1 episode \"Fallback\" and season 2 episode \"Brother's Keeper\". In Season 1, Episode 10, \"Clarity\", Dr Will Halstead kisses her, showing her that he has feelings for her. However, as she is grieving her late husband, she gently tells Dr Halstead that she does have feelings for him, it just \"isn't the right time yet\". After their break up, he ends up dancing with Natalie while at Noah's graduation party. At the end of Season 4, Agent Lee convinces Natalie to take Will back, so she goes after him and gets into his car as she was going to tell him that she still loves him, until a car hits them. While unconscious, her ex-boyfriend, Phillip Davis slipped a ring onto her finger and convinced everyone that they were engaged, except for Dr Marcel who brings it up with Phillip and tells Will. In Season 6, Natalie alters data on a trial Will is running to have her mother accepted. She then stole medication to treat her mother in secret. Will was irate when finding out but ready to take the blame for it. April's parents were immigrants from Brazil. She attended high school with Severide and they share a close friendship. He had been going through a rebellious phase in high school after being abandoned by his father and the Sextons often invited him to their house out of concern. He proposes to her in the episode \"Inherent Bias\". In the season 2 fall finale, it was revealed she that she is pregnant. However, April suffers a miscarriage and her engagement to Tate ends. In the season 2 finale, “Love Hurts” the doctors celebrate Noah Sexton's (April's younger brother) graduation party after he graduated medical school. As she stands there, Dr. Ethan Choi walks over and kisses her. A nurse grows suspicious of them and asks her questions, which April simply ignores. In season 1 she was a final year medical student, still undecided about which specialty to choose. She has difficulty dealing with death and the experience of having to call time of death on a patient gets to her. During the season 1 finale, Sarah's mother does not attend her graduation from medical school but sends her money. This episode takes place after she found out that Doctor Charles discovered that her father was suspected to be a serial killer, causing a fallout between them. She decided to leave Chicago Med and joined Baylor, as she said she could no longer trust Dr. Charles when he kept information about her father from her. After Dr. Downey died, Connor was mentored by Dr. Latham, with whom he has a difficult relationship. Dr. Rhodes comes from a wealthy background and was written as a \"local boy\" who left Chicago to escape his family before returning many years later. His father, Cornelius Rhodes, was against Connor choosing to practice medicine rather than work in the family business (a high-end department store in Chicago), and he would repeatedly undermine and discourage Connor to the point where father and son are barely on speaking terms. In the episode \"Inheritance\" his sister Claire resorts to calling him at work and then confronting him in person to call him out on abandoning her in his attempt to get away from their father years ago. Connor remained in denial of this fact, remembering her as a doting and involved parent and blaming his father's infidelities for her suicide. In the episode “Forever Hold Your Peace”, Connor accepts the truth about his relationship with his mother at his father's prodding, but his father dies suddenly before they can reconcile. In the following episode, he visits his father's body in the morgue, and admits that while Cornelius was a bad father, he (Connor) was also a bad son. In season 2 he meets epidemiologist Dr. Robin Charles at the hospital cafeteria and they become friends, although it initially caused some awkwardness once he found out that she was Dr. Daniel Charles' daughter. They began cohabiting in the episode \"Win Loss\". In the episode \"Ties That Bind\", Robin broke up with Rhodes by leaving a letter on the table for him to read. He confronted Dr. Charles on the break up and vowed that he will find her to make the relationship work; however, Dr. Charles said that Robin had wanted to get treatment for her condition in peace. At the end of the episode \"Folie à Deux\" they are seen kissing one another. When the failed operation is revealed to be due to a faulty implant, Connor briefly considers that he may have been wrong; however his father's sudden death by an insulin overdose, and Bekker's subsequent behaviour, leads him to believe that she is the killer. In season 5, after the deaths of both his father and Bekker, who committed suicide after admitting to killing Cornelius in an attempt to win him back, Connor leaves Chicago to have a fresh start. He initially tries to run his own system but quickly realizes that Maggie and the nurses are actually the ones in charge. A second generation Navy veteran, Dr. Choi switched to the reserves to begin his residency and is revealed to be suffering from PTSD. He has only ever discussed his military service with fellow veterans, as seen in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Forty-Caliber Bread Crumb\", when he has drinks with former Army Rangers and combat veterans Detective Jay Halstead (Dr. Halstead's brother) and CPD tech analyst Greg \"Mouse\" Gurwitch at Molly's. Despite his cool and collected demeanor, it is apparent that he has been deeply affected by the horrors he witnessed overseas as well as in the ED. In the season 5 episode \"I Can’t Imagine the Future\" he is recalled by the Navy to cover for an aircraft carrier medical officer who had fallen ill and would be deployed for two months. He lived with his then girlfriend Dr. Vicky Glass (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), who works at the nearby VA hospital and is a fellow Navy veteran. This is due to April's belief that she will be viewed negatively if her co-workers knew of the relationship. In the episode \"Intervention\" they celebrated their 32nd wedding anniversary. In the episode \"Extreme Measures\" she initiates divorce proceedings and tells the attorney that she and her husband were past reconciliation. The character has also crossed over to Chicago P.D. whenever Voight's team are dealing with a suspect or victim suffering from a psychiatric disorder which renders them dangerous and unpredictable. One of his daughters Robin works at Chicago Med as an epidemiologist and was in a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. In the season 2 finale, he is shot after a patient waited a long time to be seen and didn't get the care he needed. She has no qualms about calling out the doctors when needed and they generally defer to her for guidance during a chaotic shift (\"Baghdad\" mode). In season 1 she and April made sure the then-pregnant Dr. Manning did not overwork and was her \"birthing partner\". In the episode \"Natural History\", it is revealed that she comes from a large and close-knit extended family and has a sister, Denise who was male at birth, had gender confirmation surgery and moved to Dallas, Texas. In season 4, Ava becomes an attending in the CT department. She and Dr. Rhodes also have a brief romantic relationship, which ends poorly. However, when Rhode's father dies suddenly of an insulin overdose while recovering from a second surgery, Bekker tells Connor that his father will no longer get in the way of there relationship, apparently believing that his father was the only thing keeping them apart. Connor, appalled by this, rejects her, telling her it is too late, so she furiously leaves. In season 5, when the authorities and Dr. Isidore Latham start an investigation of Cornelius' suspicious death, she tries to get her revenge on Connor by suggesting to them that Connor might be his father's killer. Realizing what she's doing, Connor starts arguing with her more and more, until Latham, seeing their animosity declares he's close to solving the case; therefore, Bekker admits to Connor that she murderered his father in an effort to win him back and then commits suicide by slitting her own throat with a scalpel. A horrified Connor and Latham attempt to save her but is too late. Dr. Crockett Marcel\n\nPortrayed by Dominic Rains\n\nDr. Crockett Marcel is a trauma surgeon fellow who eventually replaces Dr. Connor Rhodes after he resigns from Med for a fresh start. He gets suspicious of Phillip Davis after noticing that Dr. Natalie Manning didn't have a wedding ring on her when she was brought in the ER after being hit by a car. He later revealed this to Will Halstead. Dr. Dean Archer\nPortrayed by Steven Weber\n\nDr. Dylan Scott\n\nPortrayed by Guy Lockard\n\nDr. Dylan Scott is the ED pediatrician. He is former Chicago police officer who switched careers to medicine. Recurring\n\nNotes\n\nFamily members\nNoah Sexton (Roland Buck III) is an emergency medicine resident and younger brother of April. It is implied in a conversation Severide had with April that Noah is the \"golden boy\" of the family who got to go to medical school with his sister's financial assistance despite April being the more academically inclined of the siblings. He resorts to using Reese's ideas to earn Dr. Choi's favor, but she finds out about it and gives him a cold shoulder. He is fired by Dr. Choi after he committed a medical negligence. Cornelius Rhodes (D. W. Moffett) was the father of Dr. Connor Rhodes. His wife Elizabeth died at some point before the pilot. As the only son and heir to the family fortune, Connor was expected to follow his father into the family business but eschews it for medicine. Elizabeth's death and Connor's choice to go into medicine lead to a bitter estrangement between father and son. In season 4, he was hospitalized for a heart failure, but later was killed when Dr. Ava Bekker overdosed him with insulin. Connor learned the truth about his parents' relationship—and that his mother wasn't the ideal he made her out to be in his grief over her death—just too late to reconcile with Cornelius. In season 1 she takes her co-worker and friend Russell to the hospital after he gets impaled from broken chandelier shards after he saves her from the falling chandelier. Later she and Connor speak to their father about using SNAP on Russell, which she insists on paying for it but Cornelius disagrees. Robin Charles (Mekia Cox) is Dr. Charles' daughter, also a doctor, who worked as epidemiologist in the Med during season 2 and had a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. She left to be with her mother in Minneapolis in season 3, but returned in season 4 episode \"We Hold These Truths\". She is on good terms with Natalie, having been there for her since the death of her son Jeff and acts as an occasional babysitter for her grandson. She then tells Ethan that she's pregnant with Bernard's child and months later she gives birth to a boy which she names him Vincent after her and Ethan's late grandfather. Robert Haywood (Michael Gill) is a professor and the father of Dr. Sarah Reese. After finding more evidence, Dr. Charles confronted Robert, causing him to have a heart attack from recent treatment for it. After he was treated and imprisoned, Sarah decided to leave Chicago to distant herself from her father and Dr. Charles. Patrick \"Pat\" Halstead (Louis Herthum) is the late father of Dr. Will Halstead and Detective Jay Halstead. He first appeared in the Season 2 episode \"Generation Gap\" when Jay calls Will from their childhood house about Pat's heart condition. Pat was later sent for open heart surgery at the end of the episode. According to the brothers, Pat disapproved of their career choices, leading to their estrangement for many years. Will finally reconciled with him at the end of \"Generation Gap\". Pat died in the crossover episode \"When to Let Go\" of complications caused by smoke inhalation from the fire. His father Jeff was part of the U.S. Rangers and died in Afghanistan. Gaffney Chicago Medical Center staff and personnel\nRecurring\nDr. Samuel Abrams (Brennan Brown) is an attending neurosurgeon. She befriended Dr. Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and they started dating. Joey Thomas (Peter Mark Kendall) is a lab tech in pathology (\"the basement\") who dates Dr. Sarah Reese from seasons one to two. Jeff Clarke (Jeff Hephner) is a medical student currently on rotation at Chicago Med. At some point during his military service he met and befriended Dr. Manning's husband, who was also named Jeff. Dr. Rhodes intensely disliked him for his bluntness and seemingly lack of tact but those characteristics are eventually explained by the fact that he was on the autism spectrum. He was instrumental in discovering evidence that Dr. Ava Bekker murdered Cornelius Rhodes, which led to her suicide. In the episode \"Monday Mourning\" he commits suicide by walking off the roof of the hospital. His husband represented Sharon during her divorce (season 2, episode 5 \"Extreme Measures\"). He is also the older brother of Dr. Will Halstead. The brothers are close but had drifted apart as Jay still had some lingering bitterness over the fact that Will was not around when their mother was dying of cancer. Will once expressed regret that he was not around when Jay came home from his deployment and was in dire need of familial support. Paramedic Allen Chout (Alex Weisman) is a paramedic in the CFD.

During the season 1 finale, Sarah's mother does not attend her graduation from medical school but sends her money. This episode takes place after she found out that Doctor Charles discovered that her father was suspected to be a serial killer, causing a fallout between them. She decided to leave Chicago Med and joined Baylor, as she said she could no longer trust Dr. Charles when he kept information about her father from her. After Dr. Downey died, Connor was mentored by Dr. Latham, with whom he has a difficult relationship. Dr. Rhodes comes from a wealthy background and was written as a \"local boy\" who left Chicago to escape his family before returning many years later. His father, Cornelius Rhodes, was against Connor choosing to practice medicine rather than work in the family business (a high-end department store in Chicago), and he would repeatedly undermine and discourage Connor to the point where father and son are barely on speaking terms. In the episode \"Inheritance\" his sister Claire resorts to calling him at work and then confronting him in person to call him out on abandoning her in his attempt to get away from their father years ago. Connor remained in denial of this fact, remembering her as a doting and involved parent and blaming his father's infidelities for her suicide. In the episode “Forever Hold Your Peace”, Connor accepts the truth about his relationship with his mother at his father's prodding, but his father dies suddenly before they can reconcile. In the following episode, he visits his father's body in the morgue, and admits that while Cornelius was a bad father, he (Connor) was also a bad son. In season 2 he meets epidemiologist Dr. Robin Charles at the hospital cafeteria and they become friends, although it initially caused some awkwardness once he found out that she was Dr. Daniel Charles' daughter. They began cohabiting in the episode \"Win Loss\". In the episode \"Ties That Bind\", Robin broke up with Rhodes by leaving a letter on the table for him to read. He confronted Dr. Charles on the break up and vowed that he will find her to make the relationship work; however, Dr. Charles said that Robin had wanted to get treatment for her condition in peace. At the end of the episode \"Folie à Deux\" they are seen kissing one another. When the failed operation is revealed to be due to a faulty implant, Connor briefly considers that he may have been wrong; however his father's sudden death by an insulin overdose, and Bekker's subsequent behaviour, leads him to believe that she is the killer. In season 5, after the deaths of both his father and Bekker, who committed suicide after admitting to killing Cornelius in an attempt to win him back, Connor leaves Chicago to have a fresh start. He initially tries to run his own system but quickly realizes that Maggie and the nurses are actually the ones in charge. A second generation Navy veteran, Dr. Choi switched to the reserves to begin his residency and is revealed to be suffering from PTSD. He has only ever discussed his military service with fellow veterans, as seen in the Chicago P.D. episode \"Forty-Caliber Bread Crumb\", when he has drinks with former Army Rangers and combat veterans Detective Jay Halstead (Dr. Halstead's brother) and CPD tech analyst Greg \"Mouse\" Gurwitch at Molly's. Despite his cool and collected demeanor, it is apparent that he has been deeply affected by the horrors he witnessed overseas as well as in the ED. In the season 5 episode \"I Can’t Imagine the Future\" he is recalled by the Navy to cover for an aircraft carrier medical officer who had fallen ill and would be deployed for two months. He lived with his then girlfriend Dr. Vicky Glass (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), who works at the nearby VA hospital and is a fellow Navy veteran. This is due to April's belief that she will be viewed negatively if her co-workers knew of the relationship. In the episode \"Intervention\" they celebrated their 32nd wedding anniversary. In the episode \"Extreme Measures\" she initiates divorce proceedings and tells the attorney that she and her husband were past reconciliation. The character has also crossed over to Chicago P.D. whenever Voight's team are dealing with a suspect or victim suffering from a psychiatric disorder which renders them dangerous and unpredictable. One of his daughters Robin works at Chicago Med as an epidemiologist and was in a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. In the season 2 finale, he is shot after a patient waited a long time to be seen and didn't get the care he needed. She has no qualms about calling out the doctors when needed and they generally defer to her for guidance during a chaotic shift (\"Baghdad\" mode). In season 1 she and April made sure the then-pregnant Dr. Manning did not overwork and was her \"birthing partner\". In the episode \"Natural History\", it is revealed that she comes from a large and close-knit extended family and has a sister, Denise who was male at birth, had gender confirmation surgery and moved to Dallas, Texas. In season 4, Ava becomes an attending in the CT department. She and Dr. Rhodes also have a brief romantic relationship, which ends poorly. However, when Rhode's father dies suddenly of an insulin overdose while recovering from a second surgery, Bekker tells Connor that his father will no longer get in the way of there relationship, apparently believing that his father was the only thing keeping them apart. Connor, appalled by this, rejects her, telling her it is too late, so she furiously leaves. In season 5, when the authorities and Dr. Isidore Latham start an investigation of Cornelius' suspicious death, she tries to get her revenge on Connor by suggesting to them that Connor might be his father's killer. Realizing what she's doing, Connor starts arguing with her more and more, until Latham, seeing their animosity declares he's close to solving the case; therefore, Bekker admits to Connor that she murderered his father in an effort to win him back and then commits suicide by slitting her own throat with a scalpel. A horrified Connor and Latham attempt to save her but is too late. Dr. Crockett Marcel\n\nPortrayed by Dominic Rains\n\nDr. Crockett Marcel is a trauma surgeon fellow who eventually replaces Dr. Connor Rhodes after he resigns from Med for a fresh start. He gets suspicious of Phillip Davis after noticing that Dr. Natalie Manning didn't have a wedding ring on her when she was brought in the ER after being hit by a car. He later revealed this to Will Halstead. Dr. Dean Archer\nPortrayed by Steven Weber\n\nDr. Dylan Scott\n\nPortrayed by Guy Lockard\n\nDr. Dylan Scott is the ED pediatrician. He is former Chicago police officer who switched careers to medicine. Recurring\n\nNotes\n\nFamily members\nNoah Sexton (Roland Buck III) is an emergency medicine resident and younger brother of April. It is implied in a conversation Severide had with April that Noah is the \"golden boy\" of the family who got to go to medical school with his sister's financial assistance despite April being the more academically inclined of the siblings. He resorts to using Reese's ideas to earn Dr. Choi's favor, but she finds out about it and gives him a cold shoulder. He is fired by Dr. Choi after he committed a medical negligence. Cornelius Rhodes (D. W. Moffett) was the father of Dr. Connor Rhodes. His wife Elizabeth died at some point before the pilot. As the only son and heir to the family fortune, Connor was expected to follow his father into the family business but eschews it for medicine. Elizabeth's death and Connor's choice to go into medicine lead to a bitter estrangement between father and son. In season 4, he was hospitalized for a heart failure, but later was killed when Dr. Ava Bekker overdosed him with insulin. Connor learned the truth about his parents' relationship—and that his mother wasn't the ideal he made her out to be in his grief over her death—just too late to reconcile with Cornelius. In season 1 she takes her co-worker and friend Russell to the hospital after he gets impaled from broken chandelier shards after he saves her from the falling chandelier. Later she and Connor speak to their father about using SNAP on Russell, which she insists on paying for it but Cornelius disagrees. Robin Charles (Mekia Cox) is Dr. Charles' daughter, also a doctor, who worked as epidemiologist in the Med during season 2 and had a relationship with Dr. Rhodes. She left to be with her mother in Minneapolis in season 3, but returned in season 4 episode \"We Hold These Truths\". She is on good terms with Natalie, having been there for her since the death of her son Jeff and acts as an occasional babysitter for her grandson. She then tells Ethan that she's pregnant with Bernard's child and months later she gives birth to a boy which she names him Vincent after her and Ethan's late grandfather. Robert Haywood (Michael Gill) is a professor and the father of Dr. Sarah Reese. After finding more evidence, Dr. Charles confronted Robert, causing him to have a heart attack from recent treatment for it. After he was treated and imprisoned, Sarah decided to leave Chicago to distant herself from her father and Dr. Charles. Patrick \"Pat\" Halstead (Louis Herthum) is the late father of Dr. Will Halstead and Detective Jay Halstead. He first appeared in the Season 2 episode \"Generation Gap\" when Jay calls Will from their childhood house about Pat's heart condition. Pat was later sent for open heart surgery at the end of the episode. According to the brothers, Pat disapproved of their career choices, leading to their estrangement for many years. Will finally reconciled with him at the end of \"Generation Gap\". Pat died in the crossover episode \"When to Let Go\" of complications caused by smoke inhalation from the fire. His father Jeff was part of the U.S. Rangers and died in Afghanistan. Gaffney Chicago Medical Center staff and personnel\nRecurring\nDr. Samuel Abrams (Brennan Brown) is an attending neurosurgeon. She befriended Dr. Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and they started dating. Joey Thomas (Peter Mark Kendall) is a lab tech in pathology (\"the basement\") who dates Dr. Sarah Reese from seasons one to two. Jeff Clarke (Jeff Hephner) is a medical student currently on rotation at Chicago Med. At some point during his military service he met and befriended Dr. Manning's husband, who was also named Jeff. Dr. Rhodes intensely disliked him for his bluntness and seemingly lack of tact but those characteristics are eventually explained by the fact that he was on the autism spectrum. He was instrumental in discovering evidence that Dr. Ava Bekker murdered Cornelius Rhodes, which led to her suicide. In the episode \"Monday Mourning\" he commits suicide by walking off the roof of the hospital. His husband represented Sharon during her divorce (season 2, episode 5 \"Extreme Measures\"). He is also the older brother of Dr. Will Halstead. The brothers are close but had drifted apart as Jay still had some lingering bitterness over the fact that Will was not around when their mother was dying of cancer. Will once expressed regret that he was not around when Jay came home from his deployment and was in dire need of familial support. Paramedic Allen Chout (Alex Weisman) is a paramedic in the CFD.

Examples of common meanings of different coloured roses are: true love (red), mystery (blue), innocence or purity (white), death (black), friendship (yellow), and passion (orange). Known as the “queen of flowers”, the rose represents Mary as Queen of Heaven. Bernard of Clairvaux said, \"Eve was a thorn, wounding, bringing death to all; in Mary we see a rose, soothing everybody's hurts, giving the destiny of salvation back to all.\" Mary is celebrated under the title \"Our Lady of the Rose in Lucca, Italy on January 30. Roses feature prominently in the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In William Blake's poem \"The Sick Rose\" the rose is a symbol for love or passion, it is crimson and dark but now sick, the worm has infected it. The rose in the popular 13th-century French poem \"Romance of the Rose\" is a personification of the woman, the object of the lover's attentions, and his plucking of the rose represents his conquest of her. In the title of William Faulkner's short story \"A Rose for Emily\" the rose has a number of possible meanings: as Emily's lover now dried and preserved, or a secret as per sub rosa. In a postscript to The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco discusses the reason behind the title to his 1983 novel: \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".\n\nQuestion: who is rose in the fall season 2\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Examples of common meanings of different coloured roses are: true love (red), mystery (blue), innocence or purity (white), death (black), friendship (yellow), and passion (orange). Known as the “queen of flowers”, the rose represents Mary as Queen of Heaven. Bernard of Clairvaux said, \"Eve was a thorn, wounding, bringing death to all; in Mary we see a rose, soothing everybody's hurts, giving the destiny of salvation back to all.\" Mary is celebrated under the title \"Our Lady of the Rose in Lucca, Italy on January 30. Roses feature prominently in the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe. In William Blake's poem \"The Sick Rose\" the rose is a symbol for love or passion, it is crimson and dark but now sick, the worm has infected it. The rose in the popular 13th-century French poem \"Romance of the Rose\" is a personification of the woman, the object of the lover's attentions, and his plucking of the rose represents his conquest of her. In the title of William Faulkner's short story \"A Rose for Emily\" the rose has a number of possible meanings: as Emily's lover now dried and preserved, or a secret as per sub rosa. In a postscript to The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco discusses the reason behind the title to his 1983 novel: \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".\n\n"

Meg was lucky to have a strong network of friends and family that helped her through her journey. She now works for the Cancer Support Community to aid those less fortunate. Dr Williamson talks about why her medical career became focused on breast cancer following the loss of her sister to the disease. My mother had breast cancer in her early 40's. My sister had breast cancer in her early 40's so I was a teenager when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. My parents didn't tell me and she had breast cancer. They told me that afternoon she had a single mastectomy. A year later she had a second mastectomy because the doctors back then said chances are if she had it on one side she's going to have it on the other so we're going to go and take the second one. And then a year later she had a hysterectomy and unfortunately for my mom she never really recovered from it all. But she was cancer-free for four or five years and then she had spinal cancer after that. It had a huge impact on her emotionally, severe depression, and a really hard thing because none of us understood what was going on with her. None of us understood it. We thought once the cancer is over you should be fine but she had a really hard time coming out of it, never really did. I was told that my survival rates would be the same. I had a long phone conversation or lunch or dinner with every single one I had known who had it and what did they do; how did they make their choice; how did they make the decision; and I had a very good friend who had been diagnosed with the same kind of cancer I had just six months earlier, and she did the lumpectomy and radiation. That made perfect sense to me. My husband was with me every step of the way. And then they lay you down on the bed and then the radiation starts and it doesn't hurt. And I was pretty good leading up to the start of radiation in terms of emotion. She said, I didn't think you'd do well with this, and she was right. My doctors were wonderful. Every doctor was amazing. And every doctor had time for me. They all gave me their cell phones…you call me anytime you have a question. These doctors were all…everyone was amazing.

And because the horses had left the barn, I am on medication for five years. After I went through radiation, I did choose to have a hysterectomy because there were other signs happening. When they were giving me biopsies…my gynecologist was giving me biopsies..I thought I don't ever want to hear the word biopsy again, and when my gynecologist said if you get ovarian cancer there's nothing I can do for you, I said.. that's all he had to say to me is I said then let's do it.

Along this journey, if fertilization occurs, it usually happens within the ampulla or the widest part of the oviduct. The sperm's journey towards the egg is facilitated by several factors such as the release of cervical mucus that allows sperm to swim more easily and the contraction of the fallopian tube muscles, which help move the sperm towards the egg. This usually happens through a process known as the acrosome reaction, where enzymes released by the sperm help break down the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to reach the egg. This is an essential step for successful fertilization since only mature eggs can be fertilized by sperm. Once fertilization occurs, the genetic material of the sperm combines with the genetic material of the egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The oviduct provides the necessary environment for the sperm and egg to meet, allowing for the formation of a zygote and the beginning of pregnancy. ### **How Fertilization Occurs**\n\nThe process whereby sperm are prepared to fertilize an egg, which is known as _capacitation_ , takes place in two stages. First, as a sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, slowly releasing the enzymes within the acrosome. The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. )The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg.Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:\n\n• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation.

Primary markings help identify the firearm that fired the bullet and can narrow down the list of possible weapons used in a crime. These markings can include scratches, pits, or imperfections caused by the firearm's chamber, breech face, or extractor. By analyzing primary and secondary markings on a bullet, forensic experts can determine important information such as the make and model of the firearm used, its potential history, and potentially link it to a specific crime.

The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics. Psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks, feels, or even behaves. This correlation can be viewed in normal, everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause one's foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene. In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music. By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. The loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels. What is loss of loudness vs. loss of clarity? Sound waves travel down the ear canal and hit the eardrum. The eardrum vibrates and transfers the vibrations to the small bones in the middle ear (hammer, anvil and stirrup) which send the vibrations into the inner ear. The vibrations are transferred into one of two parts of the inner ear, the Cochlea. The vibrations move microscopic, finely tuned sensory cells which send impulses to the brain where sound is interpreted. Sensorineural - A sensorineural hearing loss is a problem in the inner ear. It is permanent and can vary from mild to profound. In order to understand hearing loss, one must understand what “normal” hearing is. Loud speech is around 65dB HL, and sounds like a lawn mower is around 95 dB HL. We use the terms mild, moderate, severe and profound to describe the varying degrees of hearing loss. Severe – This is the level that most people think of when they think about hearing loss. None of the speech sounds are audible for a person with a severe hearing loss and they may require people to shout to be heard. Profound - Speech is mostly inaudible even with a hearing aid for an individual with a profound hearing loss. Amplified speech will not be clear and this person may benefit from a cochlear implant. Do voices seem soft or muffled? Do you have trouble hearing when it is noisy? Do you sometimes mishear or misunderstand what someone says to you? Do you have trouble hearing the telephone or doorbell ring? There is no signal “best hearing aid,” so what might work for one person might not work for another. Regardless, they all have a microphone, digital circuitry, amplifier, and battery. It also can reduce environmental sounds such as wind noise, without compromising the quality of speech sounds. Too many people know someone who bought a hearing aid, only to let it sit in their drawer. Listening may be considered as a simple and isolated process, but it would be far more precise to perceive it as a complex and systematic process. It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion.

The most commonly tested methods are subcutaneous and intravenous injections of mice. Subcutaneous is the most applicable to actual bites. What Is a Subcutaneous Injection? A subcutaneous injection is a method of administering medication. Subcutaneous means under the skin. In this type of injection, a short needle is used to inject a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. This type of injection is used when other methods of administration might be less effective. Other methods, like intravenous injection, can be difficult and costly. For small amounts of delicate drugs, a subcutaneous injection can be a useful, safe, and convenient method of getting a medication into your body. Medications administered by subcutaneous injection include drugs that can be given in small volumes (usually less than 1 mL but up to 2 mL is safe). Insulin and some hormones are commonly administered as subcutaneous injections. While it’s intended to be given intramuscularly, epinephrine will also work if given subcutaneously. Some vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. The location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels. Clean and inspect the injection site. Alternate injection sites to prevent damage to an area with repeated injections. If you’re using a pen delivery system, attach the needle to the pen. Dial a small dose (usually 2 units or 0.02 mL, or as indicated by the package instructions) and push the button to expel the primer. Dial the correct dose and prepare for your injection. This pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection easier. Inject the needle. If you have very little fat on your body, you may need to inject the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin. Insert the medication. Slowly push the plunger to inject the medication. You should inject the entire amount of medication. Withdraw the needle. Use gauze to apply light pressure to the injection site. If you’ll be doing this type of injection for more than one dose or for multiple days, you’ll need to rotate the injection sites. This means that you shouldn’t inject medicine into the same spot twice in a row. For example, if you injected medicine into your left thigh this morning, use your right thigh this afternoon. Using the same injection site over and over again can cause discomfort and even tissue damage. What Is a Drug Allergy? A subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. Medication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise.

Some vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. The location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels. Clean and inspect the injection site. Alternate injection sites to prevent damage to an area with repeated injections. If you’re using a pen delivery system, attach the needle to the pen. Dial a small dose (usually 2 units or 0.02 mL, or as indicated by the package instructions) and push the button to expel the primer. Dial the correct dose and prepare for your injection. This pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection easier. Inject the needle. If you have very little fat on your body, you may need to inject the needle at a 45-degree angle to the skin. Insert the medication. Slowly push the plunger to inject the medication. You should inject the entire amount of medication. Withdraw the needle. Use gauze to apply light pressure to the injection site. If you’ll be doing this type of injection for more than one dose or for multiple days, you’ll need to rotate the injection sites. This means that you shouldn’t inject medicine into the same spot twice in a row. For example, if you injected medicine into your left thigh this morning, use your right thigh this afternoon. Using the same injection site over and over again can cause discomfort and even tissue damage. What Is a Drug Allergy? A subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. Medication-specific\nDue to the frequency of injections required for the administration of insulin products via subcutaneous injection, insulin is associated with the development of lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. The injection sites for self-injection of medication are the same as for injection by a healthcare professional, and the skill can be taught to patients using pictures, videos, or models of the subcutaneous tissue for practice. People who are to self-inject medicine subcutaneously should be trained how to evaluate and rotate the injection site if complications or contraindications arise.

A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. For example, this 2-uniform hypergraph represents a graph with 4 vertices {1,2,3,4} and 3 edges: By the above definition, a matching in a graph is a set M of edges, such that each two edges in M have an empty intersection. This is equivalent to saying that no two edges in M are adjacent to the same vertex; this is exactly the definition of a matching in a graph. For a simple graph with vertex set , the adjacency matrix is a square n&thinsp;×&thinsp;n matrix A such that its element Aij is one when there is an edge from vertex ui to vertex uj , and zero when there is no edge. In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops.

        "context": "Additionally, every n-vertex strongly connected directed graph in which each vertex has degree at least n (counting incoming and outgoing edges together) is either pancyclic or it is a complete bipartite directed graph. A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. For example, this 2-uniform hypergraph represents a graph with 4 vertices {1,2,3,4} and 3 edges: By the above definition, a matching in a graph is a set M of edges, such that each two edges in M have an empty intersection. This is equivalent to saying that no two edges in M are adjacent to the same vertex; this is exactly the definition of a matching in a graph. For a simple graph with vertex set , the adjacency matrix is a square n&thinsp;×&thinsp;n matrix A such that its element Aij is one when there is an edge from vertex ui to vertex uj , and zero when there is no edge. In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a bouquet.\n\n"

It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Anna was born as a savior sister specifically so she could save Kate's life through the donation of her umbilical cord blood. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. Characters\nKate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. Andromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. Jesse Fitzgerald - The oldest Fitzgerald child. Sara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Suzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in-law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. Dr. Harrison Chance - Kate's oncologist. Isobel \"Izzy\" Romano - Julia's twin sister and roommate. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. Taylor Ambrose - Kate's boyfriend. He is diagnosed with myeloid leukemia and meets her at the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy. Kate has some of her happiest times with him, as he's one of the only people with whom she's been able to fully relate. Atria Books: New York, 2004; /. Critical reception\n\nIn review for The Washington Post, Katherine Arie described some of the characters as unconvincing, such as Brian, who is \"too good to be true\", Jesse, \"a poster child for self-destructive behavior\", and Kate, who is \"as weak and wispy on the page as she's supposed to be in life\", but ultimately called the book \"a thrill to read\". Adaptations\n\nNew Line Cinema adapted My Sister's Keeper into a feature film, which was directed by Nick Cassavetes and released on June 26, 2009. It starred Cameron Diaz as Sara and Alec Baldwin as Campbell. Kate and Anna were played respectively by Sofia Vassilieva and Abigail Breslin. The film features an alternate ending and more emphasis on certain subplots while entirely eliminating others.

More than 200 Winship patients participate in the Phase I Clinical Trials Unit directed by Donald Harvey. That’s good news for patients like Quincy Washington, who was 42 when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2007. Cathy Mooney didn’t need a wake-up call. In 2002, at 48 years old, “I felt like I was at the top of my game,” she says. After a frustrating three months, Mooney heard two words she never knew before: multiple myeloma. “We were devastated. I felt wonderful; I did not feel sick.” Mooney received an advise to travel from her home in Thomasville, Georgia, to Little Rock, Arkansas. The latter was Ken Anderson, who had been following Lonial’s progress at Winship. Both told Mooney that she could get the best, most current treatment in her home state of Georgia. Seven years ago, Tamara Mobley was so busy, active, and energetic that if she were a cartoon, she’d be a blur. The dedicated mother of two young boys, a loving wife and a full-time employee in a good job, she didn’t get much downtime. Then Mobley, who was 33, got tired. For a young, vibrant, working wife and mother that was terrifying. Mobley was so ill that she got to Emory University Hospital in an ambulance. For one thing, it’s rare. “There’s no other story like that in cancer,” says Sagar Lonial, Winship’s chief medical officer and chair of the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology in the School of Medicine. But the cancerous cells also secrete protein and, like normal cells, they’re engineered to do this in a particular way—the protein assembled and folded just so. When Eric Berry first learned he had a type of blood cancer known as Hodgkin lymphoma, the Kansas City Chiefs football player returned to his home and family in Georgia and sought treatment at Winship Cancer Institute. During that time, nurse Stephanie Jones took care of Berry and got to know both him and his family. It turned out that nurse Stephanie made quite a lasting impression on Berry. At the end of July, he returned to Kansas City to resume practices with his team and during his first press conference, he gave a shout-out to Jones and credited her as being the “real MVP” of his treatment. Jones says she’s proud of the honor and admiring of Berry’s determination to beat the cancer. As Stephanie shows, our Winship compassion is what is remembered. See Eric Berry and Stephanie’s story on KCTV-TV Kansas City. To celebrate the journey and one year of remission, my family and I planned a trip to England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Absolutely devastated, we decided to postpone the trip and start treatment right away instead. It was so incredible to be able to talk with the man who saved my life! My family and I decided to re-schedule the trip we had postponed for summer 2012, and we couldn’t wait to finally go – we had so much more to celebrate! That trip was symbolic of God’s healing and grace, and it became even more significant when Johannes and his dad agreed to meet us in London to spend a few days together. It was an experience of a lifetime! There I was, sitting in a London pub, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the man who gave me the gift of life. It was so amazing to spend a few days exploring London with Johannes and his dad Bernd. What an incredible gift! Fast forward three years, a dozen Skype sessions, tons of emails, and countless postcards – Johannes surprised me with the news that he and his girlfriend Tina were coming to Georgia to celebrate the 5-year anniversary of my transplant — I call it my transplantiversary. They arrived on Aug. 15 and we spent the weekend camping out at Lake Lanier with friends and family. I loved every minute of it! We also took Johannes and Tina to tour Winship and meet some of my doctors and practitioners, which was an amazing experience. What a beautiful experience! I will forever be connected to Johannes and his family, and it is all because he joined the bone marrow registry in Germany. My prayer and my hope is that others will be inspired to join the registry as well – there are so many people who need this life-saving gift, and you could be the match for them! Erin Blonshine lives in Gwinnett County and works as a hospital teacher in the School Program at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. She felt called to work with children and families experiencing challenges similar to her own. She also loves to travel, hang out with her friends, and relax at Lake Burton. Tamara Mobley, 38 and married with 8 and 12 year old sons, has been battling multiple myeloma for five years now under the care of Dr. Sagar Lonial at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. A cancer diagnosis always comes as a shock, but it’s particularly unexpected at that age. I was treated here at Winship, by Dr. Toncred Styblo and Dr. David Lawson. Twenty-five years later, all three of us are still here. That’s why the Celebration of Living event is so near and dear to my heart. We all know that battling cancer has very dark moments, but I hope we can bring some hope and lightness into your life. My hope is that one day, all cancer patients will enjoy a lifetime of survivorship. Mary Brookhart grew up in Ohio before moving to Georgia to get away from the snow. In 2008, looking for something more rewarding, Mary returned to Winship, this time, not as a patient, but as supervisor of business operations for the Emory Glenn Family Breast Center. She currently lives in rural Conyers, with her husband of 37 years, and their three horses. Through the generosity of donations of any size, as well as fundraising events like the Winship Win the Fight 5K, the physicians, staff and researchers at Winship are working harder than ever to achieve that goal for the residents of Georgia and beyond. Phoebe Halliwell (played by Alyssa Milano) is the third sister who initially receives the power of premonition, which enables her to see into the past or the future. To make up for initially receiving a passive power, Phoebe develops martial arts skills to better assist her sisters when fighting evil. One of the recurring struggles for Phoebe is her attempt to find a career and true love. In the final season she falls in love and marries Coop, a cupid that was initially sent to her to find love.

        "context": "My Sister's Keeper (2004) is the eleventh novel by the American author Jodi Picoult. It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Anna was born as a savior sister specifically so she could save Kate's life through the donation of her umbilical cord blood. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. The judge rules in Anna's favor, and grants Campbell a medical power of attorney. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. Characters\nKate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. Andromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. Jesse Fitzgerald - The oldest Fitzgerald child. Sara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. Ultimately, Brian sides with his wife during his testimony in court, regardless of his conflicting feelings. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Suzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in-law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. Dr. Harrison Chance - Kate's oncologist. Isobel \"Izzy\" Romano - Julia's twin sister and roommate. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. Taylor Ambrose - Kate's boyfriend. He is diagnosed with myeloid leukemia and meets her at the hospital while undergoing chemotherapy. Kate has some of her happiest times with him, as he's one of the only people with whom she's been able to fully relate. Atria Books: New York, 2004; /. Critical reception\n\nIn review for The Washington Post, Katherine Arie described some of the characters as unconvincing, such as Brian, who is \"too good to be true\", Jesse, \"a poster child for self-destructive behavior\", and Kate, who is \"as weak and wispy on the page as she's supposed to be in life\", but ultimately called the book \"a thrill to read\". Adaptations\n\nNew Line Cinema adapted My Sister's Keeper into a feature film, which was directed by Nick Cassavetes and released on June 26, 2009. It starred Cameron Diaz as Sara and Alec Baldwin as Campbell. Kate and Anna were played respectively by Sofia Vassilieva and Abigail Breslin. The film features an alternate ending and more emphasis on certain subplots while entirely eliminating others.

More than 200 Winship patients participate in the Phase I Clinical Trials Unit directed by Donald Harvey. That’s good news for patients like Quincy Washington, who was 42 when he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2007. Cathy Mooney didn’t need a wake-up call. In 2002, at 48 years old, “I felt like I was at the top of my game,” she says. After a frustrating three months, Mooney heard two words she never knew before: multiple myeloma. “We were devastated. I felt wonderful; I did not feel sick.” Mooney received an advise to travel from her home in Thomasville, Georgia, to Little Rock, Arkansas. The latter was Ken Anderson, who had been following Lonial’s progress at Winship. Both told Mooney that she could get the best, most current treatment in her home state of Georgia. Seven years ago, Tamara Mobley was so busy, active, and energetic that if she were a cartoon, she’d be a blur. The dedicated mother of two young boys, a loving wife and a full-time employee in a good job, she didn’t get much downtime. Then Mobley, who was 33, got tired. For a young, vibrant, working wife and mother that was terrifying. Mobley was so ill that she got to Emory University Hospital in an ambulance. For one thing, it’s rare. “There’s no other story like that in cancer,” says Sagar Lonial, Winship’s chief medical officer and chair of the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology in the School of Medicine. But the cancerous cells also secrete protein and, like normal cells, they’re engineered to do this in a particular way—the protein assembled and folded just so. When Eric Berry first learned he had a type of blood cancer known as Hodgkin lymphoma, the Kansas City Chiefs football player returned to his home and family in Georgia and sought treatment at Winship Cancer Institute. During that time, nurse Stephanie Jones took care of Berry and got to know both him and his family. It turned out that nurse Stephanie made quite a lasting impression on Berry. At the end of July, he returned to Kansas City to resume practices with his team and during his first press conference, he gave a shout-out to Jones and credited her as being the “real MVP” of his treatment. Jones says she’s proud of the honor and admiring of Berry’s determination to beat the cancer. As Stephanie shows, our Winship compassion is what is remembered. See Eric Berry and Stephanie’s story on KCTV-TV Kansas City. To celebrate the journey and one year of remission, my family and I planned a trip to England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Absolutely devastated, we decided to postpone the trip and start treatment right away instead. It was so incredible to be able to talk with the man who saved my life! My family and I decided to re-schedule the trip we had postponed for summer 2012, and we couldn’t wait to finally go – we had so much more to celebrate! That trip was symbolic of God’s healing and grace, and it became even more significant when Johannes and his dad agreed to meet us in London to spend a few days together. It was an experience of a lifetime! There I was, sitting in a London pub, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the man who gave me the gift of life. It was so amazing to spend a few days exploring London with Johannes and his dad Bernd. What an incredible gift! Fast forward three years, a dozen Skype sessions, tons of emails, and countless postcards – Johannes surprised me with the news that he and his girlfriend Tina were coming to Georgia to celebrate the 5-year anniversary of my transplant — I call it my transplantiversary. They arrived on Aug. 15 and we spent the weekend camping out at Lake Lanier with friends and family. I loved every minute of it! We also took Johannes and Tina to tour Winship and meet some of my doctors and practitioners, which was an amazing experience. What a beautiful experience! I will forever be connected to Johannes and his family, and it is all because he joined the bone marrow registry in Germany. My prayer and my hope is that others will be inspired to join the registry as well – there are so many people who need this life-saving gift, and you could be the match for them!

In 1948, controversy struck when the \n\n Quaglia played for the France men's national ice hockey team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, and the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz. He won a silver medal at the 1923 European Championship and was also the tournament's top scorer, finishing with 10 goals. At the 1924 European Championship, he won a gold medal with France and scored the game-winning goal against Sweden in the final. The Trophée Léon Quaglia, a short-track speed skating event, is held annually in Chamonix in his honour. Updated on November 1, 2018 ''This table includes two medals – one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.\n\n"

On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway. PFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. On the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP. When AMP or ADP levels are high, they bind to specific sites on PFK-1, inhibiting its activity and slowing down glycolysis. Allosteric inhibition refers to the process in which the activity of an enzyme is regulated by the binding of a molecule to a specific site other than the active site. When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required.

After achieving three more podiums in Belgium, Russia (where he set his first fastest lap of a race) and Abu Dhabi (part of the Williams team's first double podium since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix), Bottas finished 4th overall in the Drivers' Championship, beating the likes of former world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso. Ferrari dominated the opening weekend at Albert Park in Australia, comfortably locking out the front row in qualifying and earning a 1–2 in the race. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race on his way to a lights-to-flag victory, with teammate Rubens Barrichello and Renault's Fernando Alonso joining him on the podium. Schumacher followed that up with another pole and victory at Sepang, finishing ahead of Juan Pablo Montoya and Jenson Button, the British driver scoring his first career podium and the BAR Honda team's best result since the 2001 German Grand Prix. Mark Webber, who split the Ferraris in qualifying in his unfancied Jaguar, suffered a poor start before colliding with Ralf Schumacher and spinning out. The Ferrari duo of Schumacher and Barrichello once again finished 1–2 in both qualifying and the race, with Button's second consecutive podium elevating him to third in the Drivers' Championship as the series headed for Europe.\n\n"

ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation.

As protons move down the electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane protein ATP synthase, ATP is generated from ADP and an inorganic phosphate group. Some examples of metabolic pathways involved in ATP production include glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation.

There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Development \nMotor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns. Anatomy and physiology\n\nUpper motor neurons \n\nUpper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories. According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:\n Somatic motor neurons\n Special visceral motor neurons\n General visceral motor neurons\n\nSomatic motor neurons \nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy. In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates. One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate. In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle. All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. (see Table)\n\nNeuromuscular junctions \nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.

One way to remember this is that slow muscle fibers can contract for longer, so it makes sense that their corresponding motor neurons fire at a slower rate. In consequence, the motor command of skeletal and branchial muscles is monosynaptic involving only one motor neuron, either somatic or branchial, which synapses onto the muscle. Comparatively, the command of visceral muscles is disynaptic involving two neurons: the general visceral motor neuron, located in the CNS, synapses onto a ganglionic neuron, located in the PNS, which synapses onto the muscle. All vertebrate motor neurons are cholinergic, that is, they release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. (see Table)\n\nNeuromuscular junctions \nA single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. The interface between a motor neuron and muscle fiber is a specialized synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Upon adequate stimulation, the motor neuron releases a flood of acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitters from the axon terminals from synaptic vesicles bind with the plasma membrane. In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could be either excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile.

There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Development \nMotor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns. Anatomy and physiology\n\nUpper motor neurons \n\nUpper motor neurons originate in the motor cortex  located in the precentral gyrus. The cells that make up the primary motor cortex are Betz cells, which are a type of pyramidal cell. Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. These tracts also serve as the place of origin for lower motor neurons. The target of these neurons varies, but in the somatic nervous system the target will be some sort of muscle fiber. There are three primary categories of lower motor neurons, which can be further divided in sub-categories. According to their targets, motor neurons are classified into three broad categories:\n Somatic motor neurons\n Special visceral motor neurons\n General visceral motor neurons\n\nSomatic motor neurons \nSomatic motor neurons originate in the central nervous system, project their axons to skeletal muscles (such as the muscles of the limbs, abdominal, and intercostal muscles), which are involved in locomotion. The motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers to which it connects is a motor unit. These use both oxidative and glycolytic means to gain energy. In addition to voluntary skeletal muscle contraction, alpha motor neurons also contribute to muscle tone, the continuous force generated by noncontracting muscle to oppose stretching. When a muscle is stretched, sensory neurons within the muscle spindle detect the degree of stretch and send a signal to the CNS. The CNS activates alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord, which cause extrafusal muscle fibers to contract and thereby resist further stretching. There are two types of beta motor neurons:          Slow Contracting- These innervate extrafusal fibers. They regulate the sensitivity of the spindle to muscle stretching. With activation of gamma neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers contract so that only a small stretch is required to activate spindle sensory neurons and the stretch reflex. Static- These focus on Bag2 fibers and enhance stretch sensitivity. This restricts larger neurons to receive a larger excitatory signal in order to stimulate the muscle fibers it innervates.

They extolled Starrett's performance, stating he \"plays the Durango Kid in a roaringly-paced Western which, despite a few shortcomings, shapes up as good, exciting entertainment for action-film fans. known stunt roles are the leap off a cliff into water as the Robert Redford character in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid; jumping from a moving train to a signal post as the Gene Wilder character in Silver Streak; rolling down a hill together with the horse he was mounted on The Return of a Man Called Horse; and leaping on horseback off a cliff into water in the Gene Wilder role in The Frisco Kid. Gilbert also appeared as a horse rider stunt performer in the 1980 TV movie Stunts Unlimited. Gilbert has been Robert Redford's stuntman on Redford films beginning with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), through The Old Man & the Gun (1988). In the trailer for The Old Man & the Gun, Redford says that he and Gilbert \"were in the same class in the same high school in the San Fernando Valley, and then many, many years later, he showed up in my life again as the stunt double in Butch Cassidy, so from that point on  he's been in all my films since.\" His most popular films include Scarface (1932), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), His Girl Friday (1940), To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), Red River (1948), The Thing from Another World (1951), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), and Rio Bravo (1959). His work has influenced various popular and respected directors such as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Jean-Luc Godard, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino.\n\n"

Different tables \n\nDNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and information transfer in cells through a process called transcription. During transcription, a specific region of DNA, known as a gene, is \"unzipped\" to expose the bases. The RNA molecule formed during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing, including the removal of non-coding regions called introns and the addition of a protective cap and a poly-A tail. This processed mRNA is then transported out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) play significant roles in this process. Ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, bind to the mRNA at the start codon, and tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. This forms a polypeptide chain, which subsequently folds into a functional protein. In summary, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis through transcription, where the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed and transferred to RNA molecules. These proteins are essential for various cellular functions, including cell structure, signaling, and metabolism. Molecular Biology of the Cell. However, there are notable differences between the two processes in these cell types. In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, which is the cytoplasm. This process does not require extensive regulation and occurs in a simplified manner compared to eukaryotes. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells have their DNA enclosed in a nucleus, where transcription occurs. Transcription in eukaryotes requires the chromatin structure to change so that the DNA becomes accessible to RNA polymerase. Once the RNA molecule is transcribed, it undergoes additional processing steps, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, as well as the removal of introns. This processed mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in ribosomes, which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. The process of decoding the information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading each codon and adding the corresponding amino acid until it reaches a stop codon, at which point the polypeptide chain is released.\n\nQuestion: where is the protien made in the cell\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The merger of the sales and production organizations in 1982 produced Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyoda's leadership would be integral to the global introduction into popular culture of the Lexus brand of luxury automobiles and environmentally focused Prius engine electric hybrids.

It is important to note that the size of the gray matter and, consequently, the size of the spinal cord, can vary at different levels.

In the peripheral nervous system, afferent and efferent nerve fibers are part of the somatic nervous system and originate outside of the spinal cord.

If recurrent, the interval during which the lips are enlarged may be weeks or months. The enlargement can cause midline fissuring of the lip (\"median cheilitis\") or angular cheilitis (sores at the corner of the mouth). The mucous membrane of the lip may be erythematous (red) and granular. One or both lips may be affected. ; Oral ulceration (mouth ulcers) which may be aphthous like, or be more chronic and deep with raised margins. ; Gingival enlargement (swelling of the gums). ; Fissured tongue (grooves in the tongue). ; Enlargement of \n\nAngular cheilitis (AC) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Etymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome. Conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. This is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Etymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

In Crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. AC is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. Infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. Angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. Allergic contact dermatitis\n\nAllergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). It is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone. Examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. Loss of lower facial height\nSevere tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. The loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity. Angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral. Firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. Oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. For more information, see Denture-related stomatitis. Secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. Other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. The condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged. It occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. Etymology\nThe term \"angular cheilitis\" is from Ancient Greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips). Angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. Infections include by fungi such as Candida albicans and bacteria  such as Staph. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. the corner of the mouth). As there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. The lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (\"collapse of jaws\"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. This organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. The mouth may act as a reservoir of Candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing. A lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. Saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. Reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. This results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular \nskin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. As such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). It is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth. Reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking. Habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. Less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. Nutritional deficiencies\nSeveral different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in Third World countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in Crohn's disease). Other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. Xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of AC. Xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome.

Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\nThe end-product of the action of salivary amylase is maltose. Specifically, salivary amylase hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, resulting in the production of maltose. It continues the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down the oligosaccharides into smaller units called disaccharides, such as maltose and sucrose. Overall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides. In the Mouth: Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth by saliva. Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. In the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. In the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border. The disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell. GI Physiology Carbohydrates Digestion and Absorption. The purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. After chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis.

        "context": "Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:\n\nThe end-product of the action of salivary amylase is maltose. Specifically, salivary amylase hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, resulting in the production of maltose. It continues the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down the oligosaccharides into smaller units called disaccharides, such as maltose and sucrose. Overall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides. In the Mouth: Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth by saliva. Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. In the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. In the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border. The disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell. GI Physiology Carbohydrates Digestion and Absorption. The purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. After chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which initiate protein digestion. Additionally, in infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin for milk protein digestion. To protect the stomach wall from the potentially damaging effects of gastric juice, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted, forming a slimy layer as a shield.\n\n"

For instance, crackles actually are rales, and the large amount of words can leave anyone’s head spinning. Knowing what to call what you hear on the other end of the stethoscope can tell you – and the doctor – quite a bit about a patient’s condition. What was once called rhonchi are now called a sonorous wheeze, and this is because they have a snoring, gurgling quality to them. Rhonchi are often a low-pitched moan that is more prominent on exhalation. It differs from wheezes in that wheezes are high and squeaky while these are low and dull. Coarse crackles sound like pouring water out of a bottle or like ripping open Velcro. This lung sound is often a sign of adult respiratory distress syndrome, early congestive heart failure, asthma, and pulmonary oedema. – Listening for lung sounds. Wheezes and rhonchi are actually very closely related. Wheezes are now known as sibilant wheezes to distinguish them from rhonchi. Sibilant wheezes are high-pitched and shrill sounding breath sounds that occur when the airway becomes narrowed. These are the typical wheezes heard when listening to an asthmatic patient. Stridor is an unusual sound that not many adult patients will have, but it bears mentioning. It is a high-pitched, musical sound that is heard over the upper airway. It is also the most common type of breath sound heard in children with croup, though it is important to differentiate between croup and a foreign body airway obstruction. A pericardial rub and a pleural rub will often sound similar, and the best way to distinguish between the two is to make the patient hold their breath. We are going to listen to the heart over the valves, and nothing more. Now, if you hear a murmur over the valve… we are getting somewhere. You know there are four valves in your heart: aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral. The mitral valve is relatively easy to find if you are used to taking an apical pulse. The first sound you hear in the cardiac cycle is the “lub,” and it is a sound full of meaning. It is the sound of the mitral and tricuspid valves closing as the body empties the ventricles into the lungs and body. It is the sound of the aortic and pulmonic valves closing. Occasionally, you may hear a “split” S2 that sounds like “du-dub.” This is the aortic valve closing slightly before the pulmonic valve and is often a normal sound heard on inspiration. To hear a ventricular gallop, or S3, you should listen over the mitral valve with the bell. It will sound like a weird plopping noise right after you hear the “dub.” The whole heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Kentucky’. This heart sound can indicate heart ischaemia or heart failure. However, it is a normal sound in young adults under 30. S4 is the heart sound for atrial gallop, and the heart beat will sound like the beats in the word ‘Tennessee’. Listen over the mitral valve with the bell of the stethoscope. You will hear the plopping noise just before the “lub” starts, which means it happens right before systole starts. This heart sound can tell you quite a bit. It is heard after heart attacks, and can indicate aortic stenosis, ischemia, heart failure, and hypertension. They will often sound like the words “rush” or “hush” and can last throughout the heartbeat. The above sample is of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) holosystolic heart murmur, caused by a opening in the dividing walls of the left and right heart ventricles. Most nurses carry out a cursory listen for bowel sounds, but you may not realise how variable and important these sounds can be. Instead of really focusing on the sounds, you may simply write down what you think you hear. For instance, the absence of bowel sounds after a surgery can indicate an ileus before the patient starts vomiting or complaining of abdominal pain. For this reason, it is important to go over bowel sounds once more, pay closer attention to them, and not use them merely as a stepping stool to the next level of assessment. You should know the structures within each area to help determine what the bowel sounds mean. Knowing the structures under your stethoscope will help you determine the nature of the bowel sounds. Although you can listen for vascular sounds over the abdomen, such as abdominal aortic bruits, most of the time you are listening for the sounds of the bowels themselves. To chart an assessment finding of no bowel sounds, you need to listen over the quadrant for at least five minutes. You should also do your auscultation before palpation and percussion to avoid influencing bowel sounds. Hypoactive bowel sounds could indicate a problem, so if you are having trouble hearing them this is significant. Hyperactive bowel sounds, on the other hand, may indicate stomach upset, cramping and anything that is increasing peristalsis. Hypoactive bowel sounds in the right upper quadrant could indicate a bowel obstruction there. Auscultating bowel sounds can allow you to pinpoint areas where an obstruction may have occurred. Finding no bowel sounds can mean an ileus, or an obstruction above that area of the intestine. Hypoactive bowel sounds are considered as one every three to five minutes, and this can indicate diarrhoea, anxiety, or gastroenteritis. Hyperactive bowel sounds are often found before a blockage. It is quite common to find one quadrant with hyperactive bowel sounds and one with none or hypoactive ones. You may also hear high-pitched sounds and rushing noises. It is important to chart the location, quality, intensity, and frequency of bowel sounds to document the GI system completely. Most nurses default to bowel sounds active in all four quadrants, but you need to be aware that this may not always be the case. A harried and hurried nurse may perform a quick assessment, but bowel sounds are a great indicator of the overall health of the patient. While everyone knows to listen for bowel sounds, that isn’t the only way to assess this important part of the anatomy. However, you should probably listen to bowel sounds before manipulating the stomach as this can cause changes in the way the sounds are heard. By slowing down assessment and giving the abdomen the time and attention it needs, nurses can notice problems that may get past even the most experienced doctors. This short video provides a four-minute overview of things to remember when performing a nursing assessment of bowel function in a palliative care setting. In very thin people, you will be able to see the movements of peristalsis, but you may also be able to see abnormal pulses of the descending aorta. Percussion of the abdomen can’t tell you nearly as much as the other forms of assessment can, but it can shed some light on what’s going on under that tissue. To percuss, you place two fingers over an area and knock on your fingertips with the fingertips of the other hand. This will allow the sound to travel through the tissue. In the case of masses, percussion will sound different from normal bowel tissue. Most bowel sounds are rather hollow and empty, but a mass will have a thicker, duller sound. Blockages will sound different as well, and if you are unable to hear bowel sounds in a quadrant, it may be worth percussing over the area, searching for a blockage. When we hear unpleasant sounds such as a fork scraping a plate or nails against a chalk board, the auditory cortex of the brain and an area of the brain called the amygdala interact to produce a negative response. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anger, and pleasure. Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the ossicles of the middle ear. The ossicle bones amplify the sound vibrations as they are passed along to the inner ear. The sound vibrations are sent to the organ of Corti in the cochlea, which contains nerve fibers that extend to form the auditory nerve. As the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside the cochlea to move. The auditory nerve receives the nerve impulses and sends them to the brainstem. The temporal lobes organize sensory input and process the auditory information so that the impulses are perceived as sound. Listening to these sounds induced more activity in the amygdala and auditory cortex than did other sounds. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the 5th most unpleasant sound is that of nails scraping against a blackboard (listen). Listen to the sound of a ruler on a bottle, the 4th most unpleasant sound in the study. The 3rd most unpleasant sound is that of chalk on a blackboard (listen). The 2nd most unpleasant sound is that of a fork scraping against a glass (listen), according to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience. According to a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, the number one most unpleasant sound is that of a knife scraping against a bottle (listen). Chorus—Arise! Oh, heed the signal well, And the thunder tone as it rolls along Shall sound oppression's knell; For the arm of freedom is mighty still, But strength shall fail us never, Its strength shall fail us never, That strength we'll give to our righteous cause, And our glorious land forever. Chorus—Arise! \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains.The sounds used in BioAcoustics are created by frequency generating and filtering equipment, which patients listen to either in a sound room or through headphones. Edwards is in the process of developing computerized techniques to further improve the BioAcoustics technology, in the hopes that this procedure will become a routine part of preventative and diagnostic health care just like blood work or pulse taking. ### Toning\n\nFor nine years, the Institute for Music, Health, and Education, in Boulder, Colorado, founded by Don Campbell, has researched and trained students to use toning (making elongated vowel sounds and allowing them to resonate through the body) as a simple way to release stress, balance the mind and body, improve the ear's ability to listen, and improve the speaking and singing voice. \"Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate,\" Campbell explains. Singing or playing womb-like sounds in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may help slow the heart rate and improve sleep and eating patterns of premature babies, a new study suggests. Researchers found infants who had respiratory distress or sepsis tended to do better while listening to their parents sing a lullaby or to sounds mimicking a mother's heartbeat or fluid in the womb. \"Neurologic function can be enhanced with music; vital signs can be enhanced through interactive sounds and music therapy,\" she told Reuters Health. Her new study included 272 preemies being treated at 11 NICUs that had music therapists. At different times over two weeks, babies' parents sang to them or therapists used one of two devices meant to simulate womb sounds for 10 minutes. Loewy and her colleagues compared preemies' vital signs during those periods, as well as their eating and sleeping, to times when no sounds were played. They found the babies' heart rates dropped by one or two beats per minute, on average, while they listened to the lullaby and heartbeat sounds and just after they'd heard other womb-like sounds. Sucking rates sped up with the heartbeat sounds, in particular, and there was a longer-term improvement in sleep patterns tied to the womb-like fluid noises, the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics. Previous research into the soothing effects of music has found mixed results among both babies and, for example, adults on ventilators in intensive care. There were no babies in the new study who were exposed only to silence or quiet talking in the NICU, so the researchers can't say how these preemies would have compared to a no-music group - only that they did better while hearing music. They said the sounds used in these NICUs can be replicated by parents without the help of a music therapist, if one isn't available. \"The wonderful thing about these instruments is that the body can take it over,\" Loewy said. Loewy said she and her colleagues especially encourage parents to sing songs that are important to their family and culture, which can ease their stress as well.\n\nQuestion: who sings stop listen what 's that sound\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Physiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. All muscles in the body are affected. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry \nRigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.

But it's nice to think of Twiztid as regular-guy Michiganders, singing karaoke at the local sports bar\". \"Joker\" is a song performed by Swiss singer Anna Rossinelli from her debut studio album Bon Voyage. It's a cover of \"The Joker\" by Kato, an Belgian artist, it was her first single after her participation at Idols 2011.\n\n"

The Indian Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare alongside Indian Council of Agricultural Research, has taken several policies towards this. Resulting policies \n\n Agriculture remains the main stay of the Nigerian economy in spite of oil as it employs two-third of the entire working population. Farmers find it hard to plan their operations due to unpredictable rainfall vagaries. The sector is also plagued with outdated land tenure system that limits access to land (1.8 ha/farming household), reduced irrigation development capacity (cropped land under irrigation less than 1 percent), limited access to credits, low adoption of technologies, expensive farm inputs, limited access to fertilizers, inadequate storage facilities and limited market access. Indians consider Ashok Vatika, a garden in Hindu epic Ramayana, which consisted of plants and fruit-bearing trees, as an example of an agroforestry system. Since the 1970s, in line with initiatives taken by other countries, the Indian government has also promoted research in the field of agroforestry.

Farmers find it hard to plan their operations due to unpredictable rainfall vagaries. The sector is also plagued with outdated land tenure system that limits access to land (1.8 ha/farming household), reduced irrigation development capacity (cropped land under irrigation less than 1 percent), limited access to credits, low adoption of technologies, expensive farm inputs, limited access to fertilizers, inadequate storage facilities and limited market access. Indians consider Ashok Vatika, a garden in Hindu epic Ramayana, which consisted of plants and fruit-bearing trees, as an example of an agroforestry system.

There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. The net products of the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), include ATP, NADH, FADH2, and CO2. In the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2. In addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism. The three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide.

        "context": "It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. The net products of the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), include ATP, NADH, FADH2, and CO2. In the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2. In addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism. The three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle.

Uruguay, who had won the inaugural competition in 1930, defeated the host nation, Brazil, in the deciding match of the four-team group of the final round. It was also the inaugural tournament where the trophy was referred to as the Jules Rimet Cup, to mark the 25th anniversary of Jules Rimet's presidency of FIFA. Brazil was hosting the FIFA World Cup for the second time (the first being 1950), and had won the tournament on five previous occasions. Both teams had entered the tournament among the favourites to win, with Germany ranked 2nd and Brazil ranked 3rd in the FIFA World Rankings. It was only the second World Cup match between the two sides. It was also only the second time that Brazil had not taken part (the first time was the 1979 edition). The FIFA World Cup is considered the most prestigious association football tournament in the world. The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. Brazil have won five times, followed by Germany and Italy with four titles each; Argentina, France, and Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.\n\n"

It does not constitute a separate virtue, but is an essential condition of the virtue of hope, and an integral part of the virtues of fortitude and generosity. Because trust springs from faith, it strengthens hope and love, and is, moreover, linked up, in one way or another, with the moral virtues. The moral virtues, originally natural, become supernatural if we practice them with trust in God’s help.\" Ultimately, you have to deal with your own reactions as best you possibly can (think tolerance and patience). British journalist James Bartholomew claims to have originated the modern usage of the term \"virtue signalling,\" in a 2015 Spectator article. His 2015 formulation described virtue signaling as empty boasting (directly or otherwise): \"No one actually has to do anything. Virtue comes from mere words or even from silently held beliefs. There was a time in the distant past when people thought you could only be virtuous by doing things... involve effort and self-sacrifice.\" Merriam-Webster editor Emily Brewster describes virtue signalling as an academic-sounding counterpart to the term humblebrag, a term coined by Harris Wittels in 2010.\n\n wait for what is desired ; Perseverance - ability to work steadily despite setbacks or difficulties ; Persistence - ability to continue or repeat a task in order to achieve a goal ; Virtues of regard ; Fair-mindedness - concern that all get their due (including oneself) in cooperative arrangements of mutual benefit ; Tolerance - willingness to allow others to lead a life based on a certain set of beliefs differing from one's own ; Truthfulness/Honesty - telling someone what you know to be true in the context of a direct inquiry ; Virtues of respect ; Respect - regard for the worth of others ; Self respect - regard \n\n According to his essay, \"Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick\", in Christians Among the Virtues, he said that Christians are called to be patient patients in sickness and in health because \"patience is integral to the Christian life\". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. \"In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity.\" He also says that God showed us the best example of patience when it comes\n\nQuestion: where does patience is a virtue come from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It does not constitute a separate virtue, but is an essential condition of the virtue of hope, and an integral part of the virtues of fortitude and generosity. Because trust springs from faith, it strengthens hope and love, and is, moreover, linked up, in one way or another, with the moral virtues. The moral virtues, originally natural, become supernatural if we practice them with trust in God’s help.\" Ultimately, you have to deal with your own reactions as best you possibly can (think tolerance and patience). British journalist James Bartholomew claims to have originated the modern usage of the term \"virtue signalling,\" in a 2015 Spectator article. His 2015 formulation described virtue signaling as empty boasting (directly or otherwise): \"No one actually has to do anything. Virtue comes from mere words or even from silently held beliefs. There was a time in the distant past when people thought you could only be virtuous by doing things... involve effort and self-sacrifice.\" Merriam-Webster editor Emily Brewster describes virtue signalling as an academic-sounding counterpart to the term humblebrag, a term coined by Harris Wittels in 2010.\n\n wait for what is desired ; Perseverance - ability to work steadily despite setbacks or difficulties ; Persistence - ability to continue or repeat a task in order to achieve a goal ; Virtues of regard ; Fair-mindedness - concern that all get their due (including oneself) in cooperative arrangements of mutual benefit ; Tolerance - willingness to allow others to lead a life based on a certain set of beliefs differing from one's own ; Truthfulness/Honesty - telling someone what you know to be true in the context of a direct inquiry ; Virtues of respect ; Respect - regard for the worth of others ; Self respect - regard \n\n According to his essay, \"Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick\", in Christians Among the Virtues, he said that Christians are called to be patient patients in sickness and in health because \"patience is integral to the Christian life\". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we have in common with God. \"In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity.\" He also says that God showed us the best example of patience when it comes\n\n"

Red deer, and possibly other species, are considered maintenance hosts for TB and this may have important consequences for activities aimed at tackling the disease in cattle. CWD is similar to BSE and scrapie, but affects only cervids (deer and elk). There are no reports of CWD from the wild in Britain, but the first European case was diagnosed in a female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) from the Nordfjella population in southern Norway during March 2016. Since then, some 25,000 wild deer in Norway have been tested, 11 of which were found to be infected: seven wild reindeer from the mountains of south-central Norway, three moose (Alces alces) near the Swedish border and a single Red deer. CWD is currently a significant problem in the deer and elk populations of the United States. First identified in a captive mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Colorado during the late 1960s, it has been present in wild deer herds since 1981. Wide-scale surveillance programs have led to a decline in 'reactions' (animals testing positive for the disease) in many parts of America, but recent lapses in surveillance have led to an increase in some states, including Alberta. According to an article in The Guardian newspaper, prior to the introduction of CWD surveillance in the US, in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado alone as many as one-in-ten deer and one-in-twenty elk were thought to be infected. Interestingly, the prions identified from the Norwegian reindeer are very similar to those found in North American deer, suggesting they may have been imported with deer products from the USA. Importation of infected elk (Cervus canadensis) from Canada during the mid-1990s resulted in outbreaks in North Korea during 2001, 2004 and 2005. Given the known migratory patterns of moose, authorities are concerned there is a high probability that the disease will spread to Sweden, if it hasn’t already. Indeed, a survey of mammal carcasses collected by the Food and Environment Research Agency in York confirmed bovine TB in 1% of the Red deer (Cervus elaphus) specimens, although the report did conclude that Red and Fallow (Dama dama) posed the greatest threat of transmitting the disease to cattle and that the gregarious nature of these species is likely to aid the spread of the bacteria. A study of the patterns of these lesions in 35 Red deer shot by hunters in France led Gina Zanella at AFSSA (France’s equivalent to DEFRA) and her team of epidemiologists to conclude that Red deer were more likely to spread the disease to other animals than wild boar were. Curiously, however, there is currently no statutory surveillance of TB in farmed, park or wild deer of any species in Britain. Indeed, 13% of Red deer culled in Northern Ireland between 1996 and 1997 tested positive for the disease, as did nearly 3% of the 340 deer culled in an Irish national park during 1997. Bovine TB seems more prevalent in deer outside of the UK and a survey of Red deer and wild boar killed during the 2001/02 hunting season in Normandy, France revealed that both species were ‘heavily infected by M. bovis’. According to a paper published in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases during 2002 by a team of scientists at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, PTB was found in a population of about 1,000 free-ranging Fallow deer between 1997 and 1998 in Spain. It should be noted that the incidence of TB in deer is very low, as are records of deer carrying anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease and Lyme disease. Principal photography began in Bragança, Portugal,  while additional scenes were shot in Norway, and Mammoth Lakes, California.

During the Hyderabad schedule of the film, some villagers of Anajpur village in Rangareddy district in Telangana had tried to halt the shooting of Lingaa, stating that some chemicals were mixed in the nearby lake during shoots, polluting local water.

A few fibers also arise from the margin of the greater sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the sacrotuberous ligament. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. Its tendon often joins with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion. It lies almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. Therefore sacroiliac joint dysfunction may contribute to lumbar, buttock, hamstring or groin pain. Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction also known as- SIJ, sacroiliac joint pain, si joint inflammation, Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, Sacroiliitis, Sacroiliacitis, Sacroiliac Joint Sprain, etc. The sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum. SI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. SIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. Throughout this cycle there is also rotatory motion at the pubic symphysis, which is essential to all normal motion through the joint. The fascia and muscles within the region provide significant self bracing and self locking to the SI joint and its ligaments through their cross like anatomical configuration. The SI joint disorders commonly refer to the buttock, groin and posterolateral thigh. Occasionally, si joint pain refers to the scrotum or labia. Broadhurst describes a clinically useful description of pelvic/ SI joint dysfunction. Clinically the patient has deep seated buttock pain, difficulty in negotiating stairs and problems rolling over in bed, with a triad of signs- pain over the SI joint, tenderness over the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, and pain reproduction over the pubic symphysis. True leg length discrepancies will generally cause asymmetry and pain, whereas a functional leg length discrepancy is usually the result of SI joint and/or pelvic dysfunction. Sacroiliac Joint Exercises- Due to the complex nature of the SI joint and its surrounding structures, treatment must focus on the entire abdomino-lumbo-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing articular, muscular, neural and fascial restrictions, inhibitions and deficiencies. A recent study has suggested that the clinical benefits incurred with training the transverse abdominis muscle may be due to significantly reduced laxity in the SI joint. Manipulation of a dysfunctional sacro-iliac joint where the innominate bone is posteriorized using the Chicago technique, so called as it was developed by the Chicago School of Osteopathy USA. This belt wraps around the hips to hold the sacroiliac joint tightly together, which may ease your pain. The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. The pelvic ring is composed of two innominate bones and the sacrum. The innervation to the sacroiliac joints is highly variable and complex. The anterior portion of the sacroiliac joint receives innervation from the posterior rami of the L2-S2 roots, but these contributions are highly variable and may differ in the joints of a given individual. Additional innervation to the anterior joint may arise directly from the obturator nerve, the superior gluteal nerve, and the lumbosacral trunk. The posterior portion of the joint is innervated by the posterior rami of L4-S3. The unique shape of the joint is essential to normal function. Loading is anterior and takes place on a sacral axis at the most posterior part of the S3 sacral segment of the sacroiliac joint. Note the shape at S1 and how it is prone to 'fall away' from the ilial joint surface with ligamentous loading. Primary sacral loading is on the posterior interosseous ligaments. Secondary loading is on the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. Sacral loading increases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle. The ilial ridge forces the sacral axis by not allowing any cephalic movement of the sacrum on the innominate bone or any normal or pathological caudad movement of the innominate bone on the sacrum. Posterior rotation of the innominate on the sacrum can only occur with correction when the joint is already in dysfunction. Vleeming described form closure, force closure and self-bracing in the sacroiliac joint, but this can only occur in the unloaded pelvis or in the pelvis of the fresh cadaver. After loading, the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, but posterior to the acetabula causing a posterior pelvic rotation and creating a dynamic, balanced tension on the pelvic ligaments. The sacroiliac joints are vulnerable to injury through minor and major trauma with an anterior shift in the line of gravity causing an anterior rotation of the innominate bones on the sacrum with a reversible subluxation and fixation. The opposing forces created when the ligaments are loaded create a force couple. The weight of the superincumbent trunk anterior to the oblique sacral axis at S3 on the left causes a sacral movement anteriorly at S1 on the left and posteriorly at S3 on the right just as soon as the normal axis on the symmetric pelvis begins to move into asymmetry. The sacrotuberous ligament is helical and allows this movement. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus serves to assist and support the function of the sacrotuberous ligament in bringing the distal sacrum anteriorly and laterally as the sacrum moves from lateral flexion to its resting position when the pelvis moves to symmetry at mid-step. This is necessary because the superincumbent weight is all anterior to the sacral axis and the sacrotuberous ligament is on stretch. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus and the piriformis must act as prime movers on the sacroiliac joint when the pelvis is asymmetrical. The sacral origin of the gluteus maximus also functions to pull the pelvis anteriorly over the loaded side until the leg is perpendicular at mid-step. Dysfunction of the sacroiliac joint will cause at least some dysfunction in all of these pelvic axes. Other than when loading and moving from recumbent to standing, normal sacral movement occurs during normal gait. When the pelvis moves obliquely to the line of travel in order to extend the length of the stride it moves from a position of symmetry into asymmetry. In this position the pelvic bone (innominate bone) on the side of the forward leg (the loading leg) rotates somewhat backward and downward on the sacrum while the pelvic bone on the side of the trailing leg rotates somewhat forward and upward. This movement on the sacrum causes the sacrum to flex laterally toward the side of loading. As the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, the sacrum then moves on that oblique axis to drive counter rotation of the trunk on the loading side in order to decrease the loading forces and protect the head of the femur. This is a controlled instability and it can only occur with movement in the sacroiliac joint. Many practitioners believe that the sacroiliac joint does not move more than just a few degrees. Most practitioners accept Sturesson's measurements as accurate, leading to the myth that the sacroiliac joint essentially has no movement and no important function. In order to view innominate movement on the oblique asymmetric pelvis it was necessary to have the front of the pelvis square to the camera, but oblique to the line of travel. Movement of the posterior superior iliac spines on the sacrum is obvious and much greater than reported. Clearly, there is ample movement at the sacroiliac joint and not minimal as is commonly believed. Sturesson did not have the pelvis in an oblique or asymmetrical position nor did he include counter rotation. Conclusion: The sacroiliac joint demonstrates ample movement during normal ambulation when the pelvis is oblique to the line of travel and with counter rotation to the right and left.

        "context": "It also arises from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule and the sacrotuberous ligament). A few fibers also arise from the margin of the greater sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the sacrotuberous ligament. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. Its tendon often joins with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion. It lies almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. Therefore sacroiliac joint dysfunction may contribute to lumbar, buttock, hamstring or groin pain. Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction also known as- SIJ, sacroiliac joint pain, si joint inflammation, Sacroiliac Joint Disorder, Sacroiliitis, Sacroiliacitis, Sacroiliac Joint Sprain, etc. The sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum. SI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. SIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. Throughout this cycle there is also rotatory motion at the pubic symphysis, which is essential to all normal motion through the joint. The fascia and muscles within the region provide significant self bracing and self locking to the SI joint and its ligaments through their cross like anatomical configuration. The SI joint disorders commonly refer to the buttock, groin and posterolateral thigh. Occasionally, si joint pain refers to the scrotum or labia. Broadhurst describes a clinically useful description of pelvic/ SI joint dysfunction. Clinically the patient has deep seated buttock pain, difficulty in negotiating stairs and problems rolling over in bed, with a triad of signs- pain over the SI joint, tenderness over the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments, and pain reproduction over the pubic symphysis. True leg length discrepancies will generally cause asymmetry and pain, whereas a functional leg length discrepancy is usually the result of SI joint and/or pelvic dysfunction. Sacroiliac Joint Exercises- Due to the complex nature of the SI joint and its surrounding structures, treatment must focus on the entire abdomino-lumbo-sacro-pelvic-hip complex, addressing articular, muscular, neural and fascial restrictions, inhibitions and deficiencies. A recent study has suggested that the clinical benefits incurred with training the transverse abdominis muscle may be due to significantly reduced laxity in the SI joint. Manipulation of a dysfunctional sacro-iliac joint where the innominate bone is posteriorized using the Chicago technique, so called as it was developed by the Chicago School of Osteopathy USA. This belt wraps around the hips to hold the sacroiliac joint tightly together, which may ease your pain. The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. The pelvic ring is composed of two innominate bones and the sacrum. The innervation to the sacroiliac joints is highly variable and complex. The anterior portion of the sacroiliac joint receives innervation from the posterior rami of the L2-S2 roots, but these contributions are highly variable and may differ in the joints of a given individual. Additional innervation to the anterior joint may arise directly from the obturator nerve, the superior gluteal nerve, and the lumbosacral trunk. The posterior portion of the joint is innervated by the posterior rami of L4-S3. The unique shape of the joint is essential to normal function. Loading is anterior and takes place on a sacral axis at the most posterior part of the S3 sacral segment of the sacroiliac joint. Note the shape at S1 and how it is prone to 'fall away' from the ilial joint surface with ligamentous loading. Primary sacral loading is on the posterior interosseous ligaments. Secondary loading is on the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. Sacral loading increases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle. The ilial ridge forces the sacral axis by not allowing any cephalic movement of the sacrum on the innominate bone or any normal or pathological caudad movement of the innominate bone on the sacrum. Posterior rotation of the innominate on the sacrum can only occur with correction when the joint is already in dysfunction. Vleeming described form closure, force closure and self-bracing in the sacroiliac joint, but this can only occur in the unloaded pelvis or in the pelvis of the fresh cadaver.

Blaming the Flash for his defeat, Thawne became obsessed with \"replacing\" Barry and traveled back in time to exact his revenge. When Iris West (Barry's wife) rejected his romantic pursuits, Thawne killed Iris. Fearful that history was repeating itself, Barry killed Thawne by breaking his neck. He was unable to alter Barry's transformation into the Flash, however, as that would effectively erase himself from existence. Instead, Thawne decides to ruin Barry's life during the latter's childhood, killing his mother, Nora. Thawne later reveals that the Flashpoint timeline was created when Barry went back in time to stop the Reverse-Flash from killing Nora.

The awards include $50.5 million for state-of-the-art training equipment and technology, such as e-learning tools, video, audio and interactive learning systems and simulators. The grants include $88.7 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \"Today's awards not only will provide more training opportunities for people interested in a health professions career, but also will support equipment purchases and faculty development to expand and enhance the quality of training.\" \"This includes ensuring diversity in the workforce, and that well-trained professionals practice in areas of severe need.\" Funding will target workforce development programs for pre- and post-doctoral training for dental residents; dental faculty; loan repayment for faculty who teach primary care dentistry; and training for practicing dentists, or other approved dental trainees in general, pediatric, and public health dentistry and dental hygiene programs. Funding from the Recovery Act will provide 208 awards to assist with purchasing equipment for training current and future health professionals across disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate, and post- graduate education levels. Twenty-nine grants will be made to states that provide matching funds to assist health professionals in repaying their educational loans. Funding will support 10 grants for patient navigator outreach and chronic disease prevention programs, typically supported by healthcare information technology, to develop and operate patient navigator services that improve healthcare outcomes for individuals with cancer or other chronic diseases, with specific emphasis on health disparity populations. 11-18.

[A]gain, it is too soon to tell, but this looks like an end run around the college bookstore ecosystem.\" Though Bush generally refrained from making major proposals for new domestic programs, he stated his intention to be an education and environmental president. A 1983 report, titled A Nation at Risk, had raised concern about the quality of the American educational system. Bush proposed the Educational Excellence Act of 1989, a plan to reward high-performing schools with federal grants and provide support for the establishment of magnet schools. Bush's education platform consisted mainly of offering federal support for a variety of innovations, such as open enrollment, incentive pay for outstanding teachers, and rewards for schools that improve performance with underprivileged children.

The awards include $50.5 million for state-of-the-art training equipment and technology, such as e-learning tools, video, audio and interactive learning systems and simulators. The grants include $88.7 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \"Today's awards not only will provide more training opportunities for people interested in a health professions career, but also will support equipment purchases and faculty development to expand and enhance the quality of training.\" \"This includes ensuring diversity in the workforce, and that well-trained professionals practice in areas of severe need.\" Funding will target workforce development programs for pre- and post-doctoral training for dental residents; dental faculty; loan repayment for faculty who teach primary care dentistry; and training for practicing dentists, or other approved dental trainees in general, pediatric, and public health dentistry and dental hygiene programs. Funding from the Recovery Act will provide 208 awards to assist with purchasing equipment for training current and future health professionals across disciplines at the undergraduate, graduate, and post- graduate education levels. Twenty-nine grants will be made to states that provide matching funds to assist health professionals in repaying their educational loans. Funding will support 10 grants for patient navigator outreach and chronic disease prevention programs, typically supported by healthcare information technology, to develop and operate patient navigator services that improve healthcare outcomes for individuals with cancer or other chronic diseases, with specific emphasis on health disparity populations. 11-18.

Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Neurons are often grouped into a cluster known as a nucleus where they usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. The functional components of a neuron include the cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. The processes extending from the cell body, such as the axon and dendrites, are responsible for transmitting information. Dendrites, on the other hand, receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. They connect the axon of one neuron to the dendrites or cell body of another neuron, forming synapses. Neurons transmit different types of information to the brain. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors (found in the skin, eyes, ears, etc.) Interneurons, also known as intercalated neurons, form a network within the central nervous system, allowing for communication and integration between sensory and motor neurons. In summary, neurons are composed of a cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions.

A unique part of the series was that its books were written as stories, taking place from an \"in-universe\" perspective, presenting its subjects as real people, places, and things. ; The plot of Night of the New Magicians from the Magic Tree House book series by Mary Pope Osborne had the protagonists searching the 1889 World's Fair for four of the world's great visionaries including Edison. Critics have remained in disagreement over what genre Amber House best fits into; Kirkus Reviews dubbed it \"horror romance,\" and Booklist cited the story's \"Gothic feel,\" while Publishers Weekly claimed the story \"straddles the lines between magical realism, fantasy, ghost stories, and horror, with a touch of romance and classic glamour.\" The authors categorize the book (and its sequels) as \"a time travel series.\" The titles in the series are The Enchanted Wood  (1939), The Magic Faraway Tree (1943), The Folk of the Faraway Tree (1946) and Up the Faraway Tree (1951). The stories take place in an enchanted wood in which a gigantic magical tree grows – the eponymous 'Faraway Tree'.\n\n"

Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. History\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Before contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa). Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear). Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices. Some Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. European-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves. The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\" On 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Native American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle. An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\" Gender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. A primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Tribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992. The authors speculate that \"Southwest women, as the carriers of tradition in this matrilineal culture, may have greater ties to their Native ways and thus be at less risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.\" Of those individuals in the Native American samples who sought professional help for a substance use disorder, 26.3% of the Southwest Indians went to a traditional or spiritual healer as compared to only 17.4% of those in Northern Plains sample. May's in-depth examination of the epidemiology of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence among Native Americans (1994) found that tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize had fewer alcohol-related problems. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol. May draws parallels to other societies affected by cultural change. Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress. Studies on drinking behavior among the Navajo and White Mountain Apache suggest that binge drinking occurs more commonly in communities that are more culturally distinct from white mainstream culture, as measured by education level, employment, and engagement in religious activities, and that alcohol is typically consumed intensively in intermittent, public social gatherings that attract the attention of law enforcement. The visibility of this behavior may have contributed to beliefs that alcoholism is a serious problem in these communities, although contemporaneous studies also show that alcohol use among the Hopi leads to higher rates of alcoholic cirrhosis. The Hopi tend to drink in the privacy of their homes, on a daily basis, and many people report drinking alone. Among Native American adolescents, alcohol and drug use are statistically associated with living on a reservation, dropping out of school, legal problems, antisocial behavior, and socializing with alcohol-using peers. A 2012 study by researchers at Colorado State University surveyed 1399 students in 33 schools in 11 US states and found that 52.8% of all Native American 8th-graders and 67.5% of all Native American 12th-graders had experimented with alcohol, compared with 13.8% and 41.1% of non-Native students in the same schools. Researchers have seen higher rates of academic failure, delinquency, violent criminal behavior, suicidality, and alcohol-related mortality among Native American youth than in the rest of the United States population. Of 89 Native American adolescents admitted to a residential substance use treatment facility, only 25.3% came from a family with both biological parents present; 73% had been victims of physical or sexual abuse, 22.9% were not in school prior to their admission to this program, and 32.3% were referred by a judge or a court. Native American youth become socialized into the culture of alcohol at an early age, and this pattern of testing alcohol limits persists until early adulthood. Approximately 20 percent of Native American youth between 7th and 12th grade belong in this category. point out, Native American drinking often does not conform to standard measurements as, for example, when a group shares one or more bottles. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk conducted an observational study of the Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s, when they were demoralized by Ontario Minamata disease, and observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but they misuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. Philip May (1996) found that the recreational drinking pattern of sporadic bingeing persists among many Native American drinkers throughout the early years that they drink, but that males often reach a turning point in their 30s and 40s when they quit drinking completely, for health reasons (42%), because they had joined the Native American Church (20%), because their responsibilities forced them to quit (18%), because they found drinking unrewarding (9%), or because they had joined an established Protestant church (4%). Nonetheless, the overall rates of binge drinking appear to fluctuate: A National Center for Health Statistics survey showed 32.8% of Native Americans over age 12 reporting binge drinking in 2005, which fell to 18.2% in 2011 and rose to 22.7% in 2016. At least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans binge drink more than white Americans. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 showed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates of binge drinking. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. Native American and white binge drinking (defined as 5+ drinks on an occasion 1–4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. Evidence that these genetic factors are more prevalent in Native Americans than other ethnic groups has been a subject of debate. According to one 2013 review of academic literature on the issue, there is a \"substantial genetic component in Native Americans\" and \"most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations.\" Another review of genetic studies from 2017 noted that few genetic studies of alcoholism in Native Americans had been done due to many Native American tribes' mistrust of scientists but stated that, in what few studies had been done, \"the results are largely similar to findings in European-ancestry individuals indicating that [American Indians and Alaska Natives] do not have increased genetic risk for\" alcoholism. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as firewater myths that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems. These myths claim that:\n American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot \"hold their liquor\"). American Indians are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Don Coyhis and William L. White argue that these \"firewater myths\" portrayed Native Americans as genetically inferior (inherently vulnerable to alcoholism) thus providing ideological support for the decimation and colonization of Native tribes, and that they continue to serve that function today. Another important way that scientific literature has refuted these myths is by identifying that there are no known genetic or biological anomalies that render Native peoples particularly vulnerable to alcoholism. Belief in the firewater myths is prevalent among Native American youth and many adults, and often leads to greater frequency and intensity of alcohol use. Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach. Indian Health Services\nThe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance use disorders among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA. Organizations\n National Indian Health Board: Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda\n Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTC) funded by the Indian Health Service, provide clinical evaluation, substance use disorder education, psychotherapy, art therapy, adventure-based counseling, life skills, medication management, evidence-based treatment, aftercare relapse prevention, and post-treatment follow-up services. Native American Connections: Behavioral Health Services\n White Bison Recovery Resources\n Native American Indian General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous\n American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Substance Abuse, as of 2017, was over 4 decades old and was included in the 2-volume Encyclopedia of American Indian Issues Today, published 2013. SAMHSA's Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center provides Native American communities with tools for preventing mental illness, substance use disorders and suicide. Native American Health Center's focus is the San Francisco Bay Area. Native American Indian Alcoholics Anonymous\n The Wellbriety Movement is an interconnected web carrying the message of cultural knowledge about recovery for individuals, families, and communities. First Nations Behavioral Health Association\n Society of TRUTH (Tribal Families, Rural and Urban, Together Healing), a coalition of American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations providing information and resources to support indigenous ways of life, healing and wellness. Issues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Alcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Such etiquette varies between and within tribes. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance. Treatments should make clear reference to traditional Native values such as patience, generosity, cooperation, and humility, and to teaching metaphors like the medicine wheel. Traditional Native legends can be used as a framework for therapeutic storytelling. Throughout history, religious and cultural revitalization movements have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of alcohol on Native communities. Alcohol education and prevention programs\nA variety of substance use disorder prevention efforts, both face-to-face and web-based, have been implemented to build self-esteem and combat alcoholism among Native American and Native Alaskan youth. From January 1994 until May 31, 2002 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the Healthy Nations Initiative to help Native Americans reduce the demand for and use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Healthy Nations provided funds for public education, substance misuse treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and supporting services for 14 Native American tribes, incorporating traditional Native American cultural values to encourage youth to avoid drinking, drug use and smoking. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma actively engaged up to 1,000 members in increasing physical activity and healthy lifestyles, initiating cultural heritage projects and a school-based health promotion curriculum which included alcohol education. have analyzed the responses to psychological and historical trauma among Native American youth and developed a series of interventions, including life skills development, suicide prevention training, talking circle paradigms, and \"Healing the Canoe,\" a substance abuse prevention program based on promoting a sense of belonging and cultural identity.

Chapman was asked whether Americans should honor soldiers who fought not in defense of country, but to dispossess native peoples of their land and their lives. It was first self-declared Indian Day in 1945, by Jules Sioui and chiefs from across Turtle Island (North America). In 1982, the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations) called for the creation of a National Aboriginal Solidarity Day to be celebrated on 21 June. Slightly more than a decade later in 1995, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended that a National First Peoples Day be designated. Also in that same year, a national conference of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people chaired by Elijah Harper, titled The Sacred Assembly, called for a national holiday to celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada. 21 June often coincides with the summer solstice. National Indigenous Peoples Day is now the first of a series of Celebrate Canada days, followed by the National Holiday of Quebec on \n\n States Capitol in favor of fellow Ponca Chief Standing Bear as setting the standard in representing Native Americans in the proper light, saying the non-partisan decision to honor a significant event in American history \"will help spread the story and better help all Americans to understand our story.” He advocates changing Columbus Day to Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In 2018, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed a law changing the name of Columbus Day to Native American Day; however, former Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin vetoed that legislation claiming that \"combining a new Native American Day designation with the current Columbus Day holiday could be viewed as an intentional attempt to diminish \n\n been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.\n\nQuestion: what ethnic group celebrates its contribution to america in october\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Some Native Americans in the United States have had difficulty with the use of alcohol. Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Because of negative stereotypes and biases based on race and social class, generalizations and myths abound around the topic of Native American alcohol misuse. A survey of death certificates from 2006 to 2010 showed that deaths among Native Americans due to alcohol are about four times as common as in the general U.S. population. Alaska Natives showed the lowest incidence of alcohol-related death. Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. In some tribes, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is as high as 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, more than seven times the national average, while among Alaska Natives, the rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is 5.6 per 1,000 live births. Native American and Native Alaskan youth are far more likely to experiment with alcohol at a younger age than non-Native youth. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. History\n\nPre-Columbian Native Americans fermented starchy seeds and roots as well as fruits from both wild and domesticated plants. Among the most common are drinks made from fermented corn, agave, and manioc. Before contact, Native Americans used mind-altering substances to communicate with the spirit world, and intoxication was \"associated with a quest for enlightenment, powers of healing, and the facilitation of war-making. Xtabentún, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory (Turbina corymbosa). Colonche, made with the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha (prickly pear). Tepache, made from the peel and rind of pineapples. It was a ritual drink, consumed during festivals such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant or lactating women due to the association between pulque and fertility, purification and renewal. Elderly Aztecs who had reached the age of 70 and had raised families could drink as much as they wanted, as long as their children carried them home safely, keeping them covered up and \"restraining and guiding\" them so they would avoid \"committing excesses and transgressions,\" and not fall \"into a river or a hole.\" Among the Maya, pulque was referred to as chih and was flavored with honey and spices. Some Native American tribes produced weak beers, wine, and other fermented beverages, but the alcohol was naturally limited to  8–14% ABV), and they  were used only for ceremonial purposes. The Coahuiltecan in Texas combined mountain laurel with  agave sap to create an alcoholic drink similar to pulque, and the Zunis were believed to have made fermented beverages from aloe, maguey, corn, prickly pear, pitaya, and even grapes. Native Hawaiians produced okolehao from juice extracted from the roots of the ti plant. Despite the fact that they had little to no agriculture, both the Aleuts and Yuit of Kodiak Island in Alaska were observed making alcoholic drinks from fermented raspberries. Rather than approval, most Native peoples initially responded to alcohol with distaste and suspicion. Most Native people who did drink alcohol were reported to show \"remarkable restraint while in their cups.\" The result was the erosion of civility, an increase in violence, and widespread health problems. European-American settlers often viewed immoderate drinking as a sign that Native American culture was decaying and was unable to cope with the modern world. The obliteration of indigenous cultures was often regarded as an inevitable consequence of \"progress.\" [Then] the white people stand, and point at them with their fingers, laugh at them and say, see what great fools the Shawanose are. Ohio, Archaeological and Historical Quarterly 21, 1921. This created concentrated populations of displaced, demoralized, and often traumatized Indians, frequently resettled in desolate, barren country where hunting and farming were difficult. The problem of alcohol use disorder worsened when in 1872 the Nonintercourse Act was amended to allow Indians to sell and trade alcohol among themselves. The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 financed the relocation of over six thousand Native Americans from reservations to cities, and funded the establishment of job training centers. However, the program had devastating long-term effects on this population. Many of the Native Americans relocated to urban areas found themselves homeless, unemployed, in poverty, without a strong cultural base or community and unable to achieve economic stability. Native Americans living in urban areas typically experience higher rates of alcohol use compared to other ethnicities as a result of acculturative stress directly and indirectly associated with historical trauma. In 1861 Commissioner William P. Dole reported: \"Unprincipled traders, debarred by law from going upon the reservations, gather upon their borders, and by means of this traffic ... they filch from the Indian his little all, often reducing him to a state of utter want and destitution.\" On 15 March 1864 an amendment was passed making it illegal to \"sell, exchange, give, barter, or dispose of any spirituous liquors or wine to any Indian under the charge of any Indian superintendent or Indian agent appointed by the United States.\" In the decades following the US Civil War, it was illegal to sell alcohol to Indians, but it was not illegal for Native Americans themselves to buy alcohol. By 1891 most Native Americans living in the United States were confined to Indian reservations, but enforcing the prohibition of alcohol was difficult. 109), provides: That any person who shall sell, give away, dispose of, exchange, or barter any malt, spirituous, or vinous liquor, including beer, ale, and wine, or any ardent or other intoxicating liquor of any kind whatsoever, or any essence, extract, bitters, preparation, compound, composition, or any article whatsoever ... which produces intoxication, to any Indian ... shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than sixty days, and by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\" The Supreme Court ruled that a Native American granted citizenship through the 1887 Dawes Act is immediately a citizen of the US and his state, and that the 1897 amendment to the Federal Indian Appropriations Act which banned the sale of alcohol to Indians, would not apply, as \"regulation of liquor was a state police power and not subject to federal legislation.\" The result was an immediate increase in the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. It spelled almost absolute ruin and prostration for the Puyallup Indians. Congress attempted to remedy this situation by passing the Burke Act in 1906, and in 1916 the Supreme Court overruled the Heff decision in United States v. Nice (241 U.S. 591), which declared that Congress still retains plenary power to protect Native American interests when Native Americans are granted citizenship. In 1924 all Native Americans living in the United States became US citizens by passage of the Indian Citizenship Act, but even after Prohibition was ended in 1933 with the Twenty-First Amendment alcohol was still illegal on Indian reservations. In 1945 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported: Indians feel that the prohibition, which singles them out as a racial group, is discriminating and brands them as inferior. Various Indian tribes passed resolutions urging that sale of liquor be permitted to Indians off the reservations.\" An attempt to repeal laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota was defeated, but in 1953 a law to repeal the laws in Arizona was amended to include all Indian country within the US. The record noted:\nThe Indians for many years have complained that the liquor laws are most discriminatory in nature. ... Inasmuch as Indians are expected to assume the responsibilities of citizenship and serve in the Armed Forces on an equal basis with other Americans, the committee sees no reason for continuing legislation that is applicable only to Indians. Interestingly, discriminatory liquor legislation was never passed in Hawaii, where alcohol laws applied both to Native islanders and whites. Tribes decided to retain revenues that previously would go to state governments through retail sales taxes on beer, wine and liquor. Native American temperance activists\n\nA number of prominent Native Americans protested against the social and cultural damage inflicted by alcohol on indigenous communities, and encouraged others to avoid drinking. Others such as Neolin, Kennekuk, Handsome Lake, Quanah Parker,  and Wovoka led revitalization movements to restore Native American dignity by reverting to traditional customs and ceremonies. Tenskwatawa, Yonaguska, and George Copway sought to achieve this by establishing alcohol-free communities. Religious movements such as the Indian Shaker Church and the Native American Church combined tradition with Christianity to attract a wider following. Modern-day addiction specialists like Don Coyhis integrate the psychology of substance use disorder treatment with traditional rituals and symbolism and with community rehabilitation to reduce stressors and help recovering alcoholics maintain a healthy lifestyle. An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002), 21.6% engaged in binge drinking and 7.6% described their alcohol use as \"heavy.\" Gender differences\nIn her classic study on alcohol use among the Lakota Sioux, anthropologist Beatrice Medicine found that as Native Americans were crowded onto reservations, men lost their traditional social role as providers and started drinking to alleviate their feelings of powerlessness. She observed that Lakota women abstain from alcohol more frequently than men, or quit drinking once they bear children, due to strong cultural values associated with responsible motherhood. In many families women become caretakers, assisting alcoholic men when they are sick or in legal trouble. A primary motivation for Native American women to enter and complete treatment included maintaining or regaining custody of their children. Tribal differences\nThere is considerable variation in the level of alcohol use and patterns of intake between tribes. Although drinking behavior has increased exponentially since colonization, since 1975 alcohol use patterns among Native Americans have remained constant. compared 1446 Native Americans living on a Southwest reservation with 1638 residents of a Northern Plains reservation, and examined their characteristics in relation to the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) conducted in 1990–1992.

Other research has also found that historical trauma is associated with substance use problems in Native American communities, and that treating this trauma in tandem with alcohol use disorder is more effective than substance use treatment without supplemental treatment of historical trauma. Consequences of alcohol misuse\n\nViolence\nSeveral studies indicate that Native Americans are at greater risk for alcohol-related domestic violence, rape, and assault compared with other U.S. ethnic groups. Alcohol and drug use is associated with higher rates of domestic violence among Native Americans compared to many other demographics. Over two-thirds (68%) of Native American and Native Alaskan sexual assault victims attribute their attacker's actions to drinking and/or taking drugs before the offense. For Native American abuse victims, the health care setting offers a critical opportunity for early identification and even primary prevention of abuse. Alcohol consumption among Native Americans has also been linked to targeted hate crimes, such as Indian rolling, the Anchorage paintball attacks, the Saskatoon freezing deaths, and cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Disease and death\nCompared with the United States population in general, the Native American population is much more susceptible to alcoholism and related diseases and deaths. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. Alcohol-related fatal car accidents are three times more prevalent among Native Americans than in other ethnicities. Among Native Americans, that number was 31.0. A CDC survey conducted from 2015 to 2017 found that 18.1% of Native American women drink during pregnancy (compared to 8.6% of Hispanic and 10.7% of white women) and that 5.1% engage in binge drinking. The significant difference between the FAS rates of the U.S. population and Native Americans has been attributed to a lack of healthcare, high poverty levels, and a young average population. Healthcare spending for an average American on Medicare is about $11,762 whereas average spending on healthcare for a Native American is $2,782. In a 2007 document, \"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among Native Americans,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that the prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome in Alaska was 1.5 per 1,000 live births but, among American Indians and Alaska Natives, the rate was 5.6. The rate of FAS among different tribal groups varies widely. Among the Navajo and Pueblo tribes, the rate of FAS is more similar to the overall rate for the United States, while among the Southwest Plains Native Americans there is a much higher rate of one per every 102 live births. Protective dietary practices\nDietary practices in Mesoamerica differ from those of Native North American peoples, and some foods commonly consumed in Latin America may prevent some of the effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Alcohol and substance use disorder treatment programs\n\nTreatment models\nTreatment for alcohol use disorder among Native Americans is usually based on one of the five common treatment models: \n the medical model, based on the disease theory of alcoholism, which holds that it can be treated with coerced abstinence and medications in a clinical setting, the general approach of most US treatment facilities. This is the approach favored by Alcoholics Anonymous. the culture-sensitive model, in which Native American counselors facilitate group therapy sessions with emphasis on Native American cultural and historical themes. the syncretic model, which has primarily a Native American orientation, including the use of traditional modalities such as the medicine wheel, talking circles, the sweat lodge, and traditional healers. The Red Road is one example of a specifically Native American treatment approach. Indian Health Services\nThe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance use disorders. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance use disorders among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA. Organizations\n National Indian Health Board: Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda\n Youth Regional Treatment Centers (YRTC) funded by the Indian Health Service, provide clinical evaluation, substance use disorder education, psychotherapy, art therapy, adventure-based counseling, life skills, medication management, evidence-based treatment, aftercare relapse prevention, and post-treatment follow-up services. Native American Connections: Behavioral Health Services\n White Bison Recovery Resources\n Native American Indian General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous\n American Indian Committee on Alcohol and Substance Abuse, as of 2017, was over 4 decades old and was included in the 2-volume Encyclopedia of American Indian Issues Today, published 2013. SAMHSA's Tribal Training and Technical Assistance Center provides Native American communities with tools for preventing mental illness, substance use disorders and suicide. Native American Health Center's focus is the San Francisco Bay Area. Native American Indian Alcoholics Anonymous\n The Wellbriety Movement is an interconnected web carrying the message of cultural knowledge about recovery for individuals, families, and communities. First Nations Behavioral Health Association\n Society of TRUTH (Tribal Families, Rural and Urban, Together Healing), a coalition of American Indian/Alaskan Native organizations providing information and resources to support indigenous ways of life, healing and wellness. Issues in the treatment of Native Americans\nAlthough Alcoholics Anonymous grew out of an explicitly European-American theistic tradition, studies show that some Native Americans prefer treatments that combine tribal practices with traditional AA therapy. Many Native American clients find AA's model objectionable, however, due to the confessional nature of meetings, the encouragement of a critical attitude towards drinkers, and an emphasis on a Judeo-Christian conceptualization of God. Among the Lakota Sioux and some other Northern Plains tribes, the repetitive identification of oneself as an alcoholic is considered to be a hindrance to recovery. In addition to a preference for treatment oriented towards traditional Native American values and customs, most Native clients prefer tribal-specific practices, rather than a Pan-Native approach. Alcohol treatment facilities that cater specifically to Native Americans can be difficult to find outside of rural areas or reservations because Native Americans account for less than 1.7% of the United States population. Such etiquette varies between and within tribes. Group therapy may incorporate ceremonial activities such as the Spirit Dance, the Sun Dance and the Gourd Dance. Treatments should make clear reference to traditional Native values such as patience, generosity, cooperation, and humility, and to teaching metaphors like the medicine wheel. Traditional Native legends can be used as a framework for therapeutic storytelling. Throughout history, religious and cultural revitalization movements have played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of alcohol on Native communities. Alcohol education and prevention programs\nA variety of substance use disorder prevention efforts, both face-to-face and web-based, have been implemented to build self-esteem and combat alcoholism among Native American and Native Alaskan youth. From January 1994 until May 31, 2002 the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the Healthy Nations Initiative to help Native Americans reduce the demand for and use of alcohol and illegal drugs. Healthy Nations provided funds for public education, substance misuse treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and supporting services for 14 Native American tribes, incorporating traditional Native American cultural values to encourage youth to avoid drinking, drug use and smoking. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma actively engaged up to 1,000 members in increasing physical activity and healthy lifestyles, initiating cultural heritage projects and a school-based health promotion curriculum which included alcohol education. have analyzed the responses to psychological and historical trauma among Native American youth and developed a series of interventions, including life skills development, suicide prevention training, talking circle paradigms, and \"Healing the Canoe,\" a substance abuse prevention program based on promoting a sense of belonging and cultural identity.

Chapman was asked whether Americans should honor soldiers who fought not in defense of country, but to dispossess native peoples of their land and their lives. It was first self-declared Indian Day in 1945, by Jules Sioui and chiefs from across Turtle Island (North America). In 1982, the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations) called for the creation of a National Aboriginal Solidarity Day to be celebrated on 21 June. Slightly more than a decade later in 1995, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended that a National First Peoples Day be designated. Also in that same year, a national conference of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people chaired by Elijah Harper, titled The Sacred Assembly, called for a national holiday to celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada. 21 June often coincides with the summer solstice. National Indigenous Peoples Day is now the first of a series of Celebrate Canada days, followed by the National Holiday of Quebec on \n\n States Capitol in favor of fellow Ponca Chief Standing Bear as setting the standard in representing Native Americans in the proper light, saying the non-partisan decision to honor a significant event in American history \"will help spread the story and better help all Americans to understand our story.” He advocates changing Columbus Day to Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In 2018, the Republican-controlled Oklahoma Legislature passed a law changing the name of Columbus Day to Native American Day; however, former Oklahoma governor Mary Fallin vetoed that legislation claiming that \"combining a new Native American Day designation with the current Columbus Day holiday could be viewed as an intentional attempt to diminish \n\n been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.\n\n"

The term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive burns. It has been developed commercially under the name Integra and is used in massively burned patients, during plastic surgery of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds. 'Artificial skin' can also refer to flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs, (also experimental).

In 1981 Burke and Yannas proved that their artificial skin worked on patients with 50 to 90 percent burns, vastly improving the chances of recovery and improved quality of life. John F.

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically inert. Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a meter was defined by the 606-nanometer wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes.\n\n"

The process begins in the heart, where the right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the largest vein in the body, called the vena cava. From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart through the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The oxygenated blood enters the left atrium and flows into the left ventricle. It is then pumped out of the heart through the largest artery in the body called the aorta. As the blood reaches the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding tissues. At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the tissues into the capillaries. Once the oxygen and nutrients have been delivered to the tissues, the capillaries converge into larger veins, which carry the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. In summary, the circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the arteries, while deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart through the veins. The pulmonary and systemic circulations take the blood through large arteries first and then branches into smaller arteries before reaching arterioles and capillaries. After capillaries, the blood enters the venules before joining smaller veins first and then larger veins before reaching the right heart. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed from it. Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins (the venae cavae) into the right atrium. This contraction propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs. In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs. Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.) the main function of the pulmonary system. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation.

Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins (the venae cavae) into the right atrium. This contraction propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs. In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs. Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.) the main function of the pulmonary system. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary vein, then pumped into the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation.\n\n"

Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Plot\nTwins Elliot and Beverly Mantle are gynecologists who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in Toronto that specializes in treating fertility problems. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated cervix\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Eventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into clinical depression, more prescription drug abuse and paranoid delusions about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Cast\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough Dead Ringers closely follows the case of Stewart and Cyril Marcus, director Peter Greenaway notes that Cronenberg queried him about his film A Zed & Two Noughts for two hours before going on to make Dead Ringers eight months later. In his DVD commentary, Irons claims that Robert De Niro declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while William Hurt decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\". This movie marked the screen debut of actress Jill Hennessy and her twin sister Jacqueline, who play call girls in one scene of the film. Irons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters. Irons also developed an \"internal way\" to portray each character, employing the Alexander technique for \"different energy points\", giving each character his own appearance. Adaptation as television series\nOn August 18, 2020, Amazon Prime Video gave production a straight-to-series order and Rachel Weisz is set to star in the series. On July 22, 2021, Michael Chernus joined the starring cast. On August 2, 2021, Poppy Liu was cast in a main role. Reception\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 42 reviews, and an average rating of 7.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dead Ringers serves up a double dose of Jeremy Irons in service of a devilishly unsettling concept and commandingly creepy work from director David Cronenberg.\" Variety said Irons portrayed his characters with skill. It is the favorite Cronenberg film of Korean director Chan-wook Park and was voted for in the 2002 Sight & Sound poll by Lalitha Gopalan. It was named one of \"The Top 10 'True-Story' Horror Movies of All-time!\" Box office\nThe film grossed $8 million in the United States and Canada. Accolades\nIrons won critics groups' Best Actor awards for Dead Ringers, and when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1991 for Reversal of Fortune, he thanked Cronenberg in his acceptance speech.

It's worth noting that people with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria). While there may be cosmetic concerns with fluorosis, its impact on dental decay prevention is a potential benefit. Reference:\n- Dental fluorosis is a common disorder, characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. When fluorosis is moderate, all of the surfaces of the teeth are mottled and teeth may be ground down and brown stains frequently \"disfigure\" the teeth. People with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria), although there may be cosmetic concern. In moderate to severe fluorosis, teeth are weakened and suffer permanent physical damage.

People with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria), although there may be cosmetic concern. In moderate to severe fluorosis, teeth are weakened and suffer permanent physical damage.) The presence of fluorapatite helps prevent tooth decay or dental caries. The prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily attributed to the intake of excessive amounts of fluoride during the tooth development period, typically from birth to around 6-8 years of age. This condition occurs when there is an excessive incorporation of fluoride into dental enamel and dentine, which disrupts the normal maturation of the enamel. While drinking water is commonly associated with fluoride exposure, the increase in dental fluorosis prevalence over the past few decades is largely due to fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water. These sources contribute to the overall fluoride exposure during tooth development, leading to the development of dental fluorosis. It is worth noting that exposure to excessive levels of fluoride after tooth development, such as through drinking water, seems to have little impact on the extent of dental fluorosis. Therefore, it is during the period of enamel formation that fluoride intake should be carefully monitored to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. Apart from dental fluorosis, excessive fluoride incorporation into bone can cause skeletal fluorosis. This condition occurs as a result of increased fluoride levels in the bone, leading to brittleness and a decreased ability to withstand pressure. In summary, while drinking water can contribute to fluoride exposure, the prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily due to excessive fluoride intake during tooth development from various sources. Monitoring fluoride intake during this period is crucial to prevent dental fluorosis. Dental fluorosis occurs when high levels of fluoride are ingested during the tooth mineralization process, which usually occurs in childhood. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary depending on the level of fluoride exposure. It's worth noting that dental fluorosis is primarily a cosmetic condition and does not usually cause any functional problems or pain. However, in severe cases, the enamel may become pitted or rough, and teeth may be more prone to staining and decay. Prevention of dental fluorosis involves several measures, such as using fluoride-containing products in appropriate amounts, teaching children to practice proper oral hygiene, and monitoring their fluoride intake from multiple sources. Dentists can also provide guidance on fluoride supplementation or the use of alternative sources of drinking water if necessary.\n\nQuestion: where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "origin_prompt": "<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nBackground:Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl, previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray. Lead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, state laws that ban the use of and national policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint, gasoline, ammunition, wheel weights, and fishing weights reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the Flint water crisis. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Concerns for low levels of exposure began in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure. Classification\n\nClassically, \"lead poisoning\" or \"lead intoxication\" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects. However, professionals often use \"lead poisoning\" and \"lead toxicity\" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of \"lead poisoning\" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead. The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity. Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common. Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). In cases of chronic exposure, lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization state that a blood lead level of 10 μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10 μg/dL. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly. Signs and symptoms\n\nLead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur. Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100 μg/dL. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Young children are much more vulnerable to lead poisoning, as they absorb 4 to 5 times more lead than an adult from a given source. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead. On July 30, 2020, a report by UNICEF and Pure Earth revealed that lead poisoning is affecting children on a “massive and previously unknown scale.” According to the report, one in three children, up to 800 million globally, have blood lead levels at, or above, 5 micrograms per decilitre (µg/dL), the amount at which action is required. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. People who have been exposed to higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher. Lead exposure in young children has been linked to learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10 μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities. The effect of lead on children's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. Lead exposure in childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s. Exposure routes\n\nLead is a common environmental pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, have been found to have unusually high blood lead levels. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting). Occupational exposure\n\nIn adults, occupational exposure is the main cause of lead poisoning. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range workers, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Lead exposure can also occur with intense use of gun ranges, regardless of whether these ranges are indoor or out. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure. It is believed to be one of the main sources of high lead levels in the country. Paint\nSome lead compounds are colorful and are used widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children are more prone to crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching, creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternatively, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. Soil\n\nResidual lead in soil contributes to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been thought that the more polluted an area is with various contaminants, the more likely it is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, tire weights, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard. Water\nLead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington DC and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis (Flint, Michigan), a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source caused elevated lead levels  in domestic tap water. Like Flint MI and Washington DC, a similar situation affects the State of Wisconsin, where estimates call for replacement of up to 176,000 underground pipes made of lead known as lead service lines. The city of Madison, Wisconsin addressed the issue and replaced all of their lead service lines, but there are still others that have yet to follow suit. While there are chemical methods that could help reduce the amount of lead in the water distributed, a permanent fix would be to replace the pipes completely. Experts say that if the city were to replace their pipes and the citizens were to keep the old pipes located within their homes, there would be a potential for more lead to dissolve into their drinking water. Collected rainwater from roof runoff used as potable water may contain lead, if there are lead contaminants on the roof or in the storage tank. The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines allow a maximum of 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) lead in water. Lead wheel weights have been found to accumulate on roads and interstates and erode in traffic entering the water runoff through drains. Lead-containing products\nLead can be found in products such as kohl, an ancient cosmetic from the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa that has many other names; and from some toys. In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled from multiple countries owing to safety hazards including lead paint. Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead. There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like azarcon and greta, which each contain about 95% lead. Ingestion of metallic lead, such as small lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and can be fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 84,800 metric tons consumed in 2013, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cannot regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Contamination from heavily used gun ranges is of concern to those who live near by. In a recent study conducted by the CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB). This has also appeared in the illicit narcotic supply in North America, resulting in confirmed lead poisoning. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in aviation gasoline, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children. The main body tissues that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The half-life of lead in bone has been estimated as years to decades, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40 days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Smaller amounts of lead are also eliminated through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Enzymes\n\nThe primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. One of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which is important in the biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons. Lead poisoning interferes with the normal development of a child's brain and nervous system; therefore children are at greater risk of lead neurotoxicity than adults are. The main tool in diagnosing and assessing the severity of lead poisoning is laboratory analysis of the blood lead level (BLL). These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal lead content that is measured over the course of a few days may also be an accurate way to estimate the overall amount of childhood lead intake. Lead poisoning shares symptoms with other conditions and may be easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Lead-exposed workers in the U.S. are required to be removed from work when their level is greater than 50 µg/dL if they do construction and otherwise greater than 60 µg/dL. Prevention\n\nIn most cases, lead poisoning is preventable by avoiding exposure to lead. Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water in the morning to flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes. Testing kit accuracy depends on the user testing all layers of paint and the quality of the kit; the US EPA only approves kits with an accuracy rating of at least 95%. As hot water is more likely than cold water to contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure. Regulations exist to limit the amount of lead in paint; for example, a 1978 law in the US restricted the lead in paint for residences, furniture, and toys to 0.06% or less. In October 2008, the US Environmental Protection Agency reduced the allowable lead level by a factor of ten to 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air, giving states five years to comply with the standards. In some places, remediation programs exist to reduce the presence of lead when it is found to be high, for example in drinking water. Removing lead from airplane fuel would also be useful. Education \nThe education of workers on lead, its danger and how its workplace exposure can be decreased, especially when initial blood lead level and urine lead level are high, could help reduce the risk of lead poisoning in the workplace. Treatment\n\nThe mainstays of treatment are removal from the source of lead and, for people who have significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part of treatment for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may be the case in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s as a result of the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally. Although regulation reducing lead in products has greatly reduced exposure in the developed world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust. Risk factors for elevated lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides). Differences in vulnerability to lead-induced neurological damage between males and females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be. Children are more sensitive to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Notable cases\n\nCases of mass lead poisoning can occur. As of October 5, 2010 at least 400 children have died from the effects of lead poisoning. Prognosis\n\nReversibility\nOutcome is related to the extent and duration of lead exposure. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood. Encephalopathy\nLead encephalopathy is a medical emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. Long-term\nExposure to lead may also decrease lifespan and have health effects in the long term. Death rates from a variety of causes have been found to be higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year). Furthermore, the neurological effects of lead exposure have been shown to be exacerbated and long lasting in low income children in comparison to those of higher economic standing. An increase in lead exposure in children was linked to an increase in aggravated assault rates 22 year later. History\n\nLead poisoning was among the first known and most widely studied work regarding environmental hazards. With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978. The 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. Studies have found a weak link between lead from leaded gasoline and crime rates. Other species\n\nHumans are not alone in suffering from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Farm animals such as cows and horses as well as pet animals are also susceptible to the effects of lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels. Wildlife\n\nLead, one of the leading causes of toxicity in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.

A few studies have found that people with high levels of lead in their body had twice the risk of Parkinson's disease. The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint. The Act was enacted as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act\n\n Lead-based paint was widely used in the United States, because of its durability. The United States banned the manufacture of lead-based house paint in 1978 due to health concerns. Lead has long been considered to be a harmful environmental pollutant. Cited cases of lead poisoning date back to the early 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint \"poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors.\" Congress banned the use of lead-based paint in residential structures and environments, in 1971, in residential projects constructed by, or with the assistance of, the federal government, and \n\n In the past, lead was added to household paint to increase its drying speed and improve the durability and life of the finish. However, Lead is toxic and is a possible carcinogen. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm). In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that approximately 35 percent of U.S. homes (37 million) still contain some lead-based paint, a decline from 1990 estimate of 64 million homes with lead paint.\n\nQuestion: when did they stop putting lead in paint\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": "Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl, previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray. Lead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, state laws that ban the use of and national policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint, gasoline, ammunition, wheel weights, and fishing weights reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the Flint water crisis. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Concerns for low levels of exposure began in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure. Classification\n\nClassically, \"lead poisoning\" or \"lead intoxication\" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects. However, professionals often use \"lead poisoning\" and \"lead toxicity\" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of \"lead poisoning\" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead. The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity. Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common. Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (μg/dL). In cases of chronic exposure, lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization state that a blood lead level of 10 μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10 μg/dL. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly. Signs and symptoms\n\nLead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur. Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100 μg/dL. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Young children are much more vulnerable to lead poisoning, as they absorb 4 to 5 times more lead than an adult from a given source. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead. On July 30, 2020, a report by UNICEF and Pure Earth revealed that lead poisoning is affecting children on a “massive and previously unknown scale.” According to the report, one in three children, up to 800 million globally, have blood lead levels at, or above, 5 micrograms per decilitre (µg/dL), the amount at which action is required. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. People who have been exposed to higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher. Lead exposure in young children has been linked to learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10 μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities. The effect of lead on children's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. Lead exposure in childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s. Exposure routes\n\nLead is a common environmental pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, have been found to have unusually high blood lead levels. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting). Occupational exposure\n\nIn adults, occupational exposure is the main cause of lead poisoning. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range workers, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Lead exposure can also occur with intense use of gun ranges, regardless of whether these ranges are indoor or out. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure. It is believed to be one of the main sources of high lead levels in the country. Paint\nSome lead compounds are colorful and are used widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children are more prone to crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching, creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternatively, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. Soil\n\nResidual lead in soil contributes to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been thought that the more polluted an area is with various contaminants, the more likely it is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, tire weights, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard. Water\nLead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington DC and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis (Flint, Michigan), a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source caused elevated lead levels  in domestic tap water. Like Flint MI and Washington DC, a similar situation affects the State of Wisconsin, where estimates call for replacement of up to 176,000 underground pipes made of lead known as lead service lines. The city of Madison, Wisconsin addressed the issue and replaced all of their lead service lines, but there are still others that have yet to follow suit. While there are chemical methods that could help reduce the amount of lead in the water distributed, a permanent fix would be to replace the pipes completely. Experts say that if the city were to replace their pipes and the citizens were to keep the old pipes located within their homes, there would be a potential for more lead to dissolve into their drinking water. Collected rainwater from roof runoff used as potable water may contain lead, if there are lead contaminants on the roof or in the storage tank. The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines allow a maximum of 0.01 mg/L (10 ppb) lead in water. Lead wheel weights have been found to accumulate on roads and interstates and erode in traffic entering the water runoff through drains. Lead-containing products\nLead can be found in products such as kohl, an ancient cosmetic from the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa that has many other names; and from some toys. In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled from multiple countries owing to safety hazards including lead paint. Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead. There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like azarcon and greta, which each contain about 95% lead. Ingestion of metallic lead, such as small lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and can be fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 84,800 metric tons consumed in 2013, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cannot regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Contamination from heavily used gun ranges is of concern to those who live near by. In a recent study conducted by the CDC, a cohort from North Dakota was enrolled and asked to self-report historical consumption of game meat, and participation in other activities that could cause lead exposure. The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB). This has also appeared in the illicit narcotic supply in North America, resulting in confirmed lead poisoning. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in aviation gasoline, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children. The main body tissues that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The half-life of lead in bone has been estimated as years to decades, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40 days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Smaller amounts of lead are also eliminated through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Enzymes\n\nThe primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes. Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act. Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same enzymes as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. One of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which is important in the biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Another effect of lead's interference with heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons. Lead poisoning interferes with the normal development of a child's brain and nervous system; therefore children are at greater risk of lead neurotoxicity than adults are. The main tool in diagnosing and assessing the severity of lead poisoning is laboratory analysis of the blood lead level (BLL). These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract. Fecal lead content that is measured over the course of a few days may also be an accurate way to estimate the overall amount of childhood lead intake. Lead poisoning shares symptoms with other conditions and may be easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Lead-exposed workers in the U.S. are required to be removed from work when their level is greater than 50 µg/dL if they do construction and otherwise greater than 60 µg/dL. Prevention\n\nIn most cases, lead poisoning is preventable by avoiding exposure to lead. Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water in the morning to flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes. Testing kit accuracy depends on the user testing all layers of paint and the quality of the kit; the US EPA only approves kits with an accuracy rating of at least 95%. As hot water is more likely than cold water to contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure. Regulations exist to limit the amount of lead in paint; for example, a 1978 law in the US restricted the lead in paint for residences, furniture, and toys to 0.06% or less. In October 2008, the US Environmental Protection Agency reduced the allowable lead level by a factor of ten to 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter of air, giving states five years to comply with the standards. In some places, remediation programs exist to reduce the presence of lead when it is found to be high, for example in drinking water. Removing lead from airplane fuel would also be useful. Education \nThe education of workers on lead, its danger and how its workplace exposure can be decreased, especially when initial blood lead level and urine lead level are high, could help reduce the risk of lead poisoning in the workplace. Treatment\n\nThe mainstays of treatment are removal from the source of lead and, for people who have significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part of treatment for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations. The chelating agents used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This may be the case in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s as a result of the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally. Although regulation reducing lead in products has greatly reduced exposure in the developed world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust. Risk factors for elevated lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides). Differences in vulnerability to lead-induced neurological damage between males and females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be. Children are more sensitive to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Notable cases\n\nCases of mass lead poisoning can occur. As of October 5, 2010 at least 400 children have died from the effects of lead poisoning. Prognosis\n\nReversibility\nOutcome is related to the extent and duration of lead exposure. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood. Encephalopathy\nLead encephalopathy is a medical emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment. Long-term\nExposure to lead may also decrease lifespan and have health effects in the long term. Death rates from a variety of causes have been found to be higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year). Furthermore, the neurological effects of lead exposure have been shown to be exacerbated and long lasting in low income children in comparison to those of higher economic standing. An increase in lead exposure in children was linked to an increase in aggravated assault rates 22 year later. History\n\nLead poisoning was among the first known and most widely studied work regarding environmental hazards. With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978. The 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It was not until the second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. Studies have found a weak link between lead from leaded gasoline and crime rates. Other species\n\nHumans are not alone in suffering from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Farm animals such as cows and horses as well as pet animals are also susceptible to the effects of lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are at increased risk for elevated lead levels. Wildlife\n\nLead, one of the leading causes of toxicity in waterfowl, has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.

A few studies have found that people with high levels of lead in their body had twice the risk of Parkinson's disease. The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint. The Act was enacted as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act\n\n Lead-based paint was widely used in the United States, because of its durability. The United States banned the manufacture of lead-based house paint in 1978 due to health concerns. Lead has long been considered to be a harmful environmental pollutant. Cited cases of lead poisoning date back to the early 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint \"poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors.\" Congress banned the use of lead-based paint in residential structures and environments, in 1971, in residential projects constructed by, or with the assistance of, the federal government, and \n\n In the past, lead was added to household paint to increase its drying speed and improve the durability and life of the finish. However, Lead is toxic and is a possible carcinogen. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm). In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that approximately 35 percent of U.S. homes (37 million) still contain some lead-based paint, a decline from 1990 estimate of 64 million homes with lead paint.\n\n"

In the capillaries, gas exchange occurs, where carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. Oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and returns to the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium, to be pumped out to the rest of the body. It begins when oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, specifically the left ventricle, through the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. In the capillaries, nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up. One key difference between pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation is the amount of resistance encountered by each circuit. This is important as it allows for optimal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that occurs in the capillaries of the lungs. The pressure within the pulmonary circulation is much lower compared to the systemic circulation. By understanding these differences, we can appreciate the complexity and efficiency of the cardiovascular system. While both systems involve the flow of blood, they differ in their purpose and function. Its primary function is to oxygenate the blood. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart and is then pumped into the right ventricle. In the lungs, the exchange of gases occurs, with carbon dioxide being expelled and oxygen being absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium before being pumped into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood from the left atrium enters the left ventricle, which then pumps it into the main artery of the body, the aorta. From the aorta, the blood is distributed through a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the veins, entering the right atrium to complete the cycle. One key distinction between pulmonary and systemic circulation is the blood pressure within the two systems. The pressure in the pulmonary circulation is significantly lower compared to the systemic circulation. This constriction helps redirect blood flow from poorly ventilated areas of the lungs to well-ventilated regions, optimizing gas exchange.

Its importance lies in the fact that this border is marked in part by the Paraguay River and, as a result, Bolivia has a water route to the Atlantic Ocean that does not involve Brazil. Currently Bolivian ships must pass along the eleven kilometre Tamengo Canal which connects Laguna Cáceres to the Paraguay River at the Brazilian city of Corumbá. It is 1260 km long; 920 km of the river forms the border between Brazil and Bolivia. While many fish species in the river essentially are Amazonian, the fauna in the Guaporé also has a connection with the Paraguay River (part of the Río de la Plata Basin). The Guaporé and the Paraguay, while flowing in different directions, both originate in the Parecis plateau of Brazil. It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paraná flooded savanna along the lower Paraná and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers. The Mamore is interrupted by rapids a few miles above its junction with the Beni, but a railway 300 km long has been undertaken from below the rapids of the Madeira. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances.

It also has genetic similarities to thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. It affects both males and females, with female patients having an average height of 4 feet and ½ inches (123 centimeters) and male patients having an average height of 4 feet and 3½ inches (131 centimeters). A DNA test can help identify homozygosity, and a skeletal survey can be used to diagnose the condition. The signs of achondroplasia include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base, and narrow foramen magnum. These estimates are outside the range of normal modern human height and considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the smallest modern humans, such as the Mbenga and Mbuti at 1.5 m, Twa, Semang at 1.37 m for adult women of the Malay Peninsula, or the Andamanese at also 1.37 m for adult women. All people with hypochondroplasia have short stature. The adult height for men with this condition ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches). The height range for adult women is 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet, 2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches). People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood. Some studies have reported that a small percentage of people with hypochondroplasia have mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, but other studies have produced conflicting results. Most people with hypochondroplasia have average-size parents; these cases result from a new mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, achondroplasia is one of the common causes of dwarfism. Individuals suffering from this medical condition usually have short stature. For female patients, the average height is 4-feet and ½-inches or 123 centimeters. On the other hand, the average height for male patients is 4-feet and 3½-inches or 131 centimeters. According to their findings, this type of dwarfism resulted from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene, which is part of the human chromosome 4. In terms of epidemiology, achondroplasia is similar to many other congenital conditions such as achondrogenesis, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda and osteogenesis imperfecta. In addition, it also shares similar presentations with other diseases like thanatophoric dysplasia as well as osteoporosis. Based on a number of studies, its prevalence is only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Two other diseases have similar genetic basis, namely thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. The signs include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base as well as narrow foramen magnum. Good thing there are certain procedures available that can somehow enhance the overall appearance of patients. The shortest person ever recorded with this condition was Jyoti Amge of India, who only stands at 58-centimeters or 23-inches tall and weighs around 5-kilograms or 11-pounds. The other visible signs and symptoms of this disease are hypotonia or low muscle tone and slow motor movement. Most of the time, individuals suffering from this medical condition are obese, mainly because of their short stature. The average head-and-body length of the male is 55 cm, with a range of 46 to 68 cm, while the female averages 52 cm with a range of 41 to 55 cm. In some regions, no difference in size is seen between males and females. The tail is about 30 cm long in both sexes. The height at the shoulder is 25 to 30 cm.

Bitterness is like chickenpox. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" \". .let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" Have hope, there are great days ahead!\n\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\" and thy neighbour as thyself.\" I have pondered this often. How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. They will fly. I hope it will be as pleasurable as we anticipate. There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. Choose wisely. I have long pondered this Psalm, especially the phrase, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.\" The thing which strikes me about it is what it doesn't say. It doesn't say \"through the valley of death.\" David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. Our dear friend Larry tells the story of his father's recent passing to Heaven. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" There was nothing better that could have been said. So let us have hope and not fear that passage before us. As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" We will have an easy, glorious journey home. My husband and I were traveling down the road and I commented about the color of a particular road sign. My husband thought I said \"sun\". He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. Because it has always been there, every morning, every day for as long as we, or anyone else for that matter, can remember. We have total and complete faith in the sun that it will continue to come up every morning and set every evening. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. I have seen many \"glimpses of love\" in my lifetime. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have watched as mother, and father, cry and joy over their new child. I have seen glimpses of love between my grandchildren. If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. Watching Jackson, I was glimpsing love. I see glimpses of love in the cup of coffee my husband so faithfully brings me every morning. Don't we enjoy seeing things like this? Don't they warm our heart and sometimes even bring tears to our eyes? It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). Not only do we have water all around, but we have water from above, too. For the Deep South in the middle of September, that is a wonderful thing. The slight coolness of the air, that hint of crispness in the morning, is the hope of something yet to be. Snow is a rare, but celebrated thing here. More than \"winter\" we have an absence of summer, a respite from that heat and humidity. So these cool mornings and evenings are a hope of things yet to be. They are a promise of what will come. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. We have been given a whole book of promises of \". .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). As as we feel the cool morning that is a promise for the relief from summer heat, let it lift our hearts that there is a time coming when the heat of our hearts will be lifted as well. Let us have hope. \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. Although I have highly encouraged the dropping of the \"Grannie\" part, both the rhyme and my name is now set forever in the minds of my grandchildren. Emma seems to start every sentence with \"Grannie Frannie. .\" Sometimes I think I hear that name a thousand times in a weekend. I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. Instead, the Scriptures tell us \". .the prayer of the upright is His delight,\" (Proverbs 15:8). Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). How wonderful to know that our voices are never old to Him, that He never wearies with our calling of His name. What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Especially when she says as she did this weekend, \"You are the best Grannie Frannie I've ever had! I love you, Grannie Frannie!\" I truthfully responded, \"I love you, too, Emma. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. .warm, sweet and irresistible. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\" The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. I remember one of the most touching scenes to me during that time was when the Star Spangled Banner was played at Buckingham Palace. The tribute to the United States by our closest friend and ally brought tears to my eyes...it still does eleven years later. Let us remember their honor and sacrifice. let all the people praise Thee.\" The thought was, I suppose, if Andy said it was that \"gooood\" then it had to be really good. Or as Andy Griffith would have said, \"He's real goooood!\" It is someone we know will be constant and true. In fact, He will be for us \"abundantly above all that we ask or think.\" Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" There was little sleep. He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. The Lord of Heaven and earth holds us in His very hands. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. His courage defeats them and they pack up and leave. .it represented \"bigger people\". His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He watered them. He could tell you at any given time how many tomatoes were on the vines. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). We are the branches which grow upon the True Vine. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. \"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19). If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever.\" That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. Each Christmas couldn't come fast enough. The pace of time sped up. Then the frightening thought begins.. . It reminds me of the opening of an old soap-opera: \"Like sands through the hourglass so are the Days of our Lives.\" We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Our hourglass is never-ending, sort of like that endless cup of coffee of McDonald's. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. We will know no end. One day we will simply breathe out the air of this earth and breathe in the sweet fragrance of our Lord. And \"so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. We were apart during the spring, when everything feels young, even aged Saturn; however, none of the beauty I saw around me could bring me into sympathy with my surroundings. I could not admire the lily or the rose, since these were to me only images of you. Thus, it still seemed winter to me, since you were away. in blacks and reds. He wears a steel helmet, broad square face, open mouth with square teeth and a full black beard. ; 6) The Slave (Earth and Fire): A black African with large gold earrings and a ring through her nose; the lips are full and pink, the eyes half-closed, sultry and sensuous; the expression is warm and friendly. ; 7) The Child (Water and Air): A picture of innocence; a girl with delicate sweet smile and butterfly shaped bows at each side in her long golden hair; her eyes are large and watery and she has a delicate sweet smile on her mouth. She gives her flowers, which she puts on the nightstand. The final scene shows the couple as now elderly and living in the same apartment. The woman is first seen reading as the man comes in. He picks up his glasses and a newspaper and sits beside her. The man is then seen in bed; she comes over and kisses him and they smile at each other. It ends with a dedication to Tanya's parents (Beau and Juanita), who celebrated their 50th anniversary the year the video was made. I criticized the violet, telling it that it had stolen its sweet smell from my beloved's breath, and its purple color from my beloved's veins. I told the lily it had stolen the whiteness of your (that is, the beloved's) hands, and marjoram had stolen the beloved's hair; a third flower had stolen from both; in fact, all flowers had stolen something from the person of the beloved.\n\nQuestion: who says that which we call a rose\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" How wonderful that our Lord never tires of us doing so. I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" \". .let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" Have hope, there are great days ahead!\n\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I thought about my flashlight today when I heard a preacher say, \"When weak Christians are illuminated, what do they see?\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. We read it, we let it soak into our hearts and it consumes and illuminates. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\" and thy neighbour as thyself.\" I have pondered this often. How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. They will fly. I hope it will be as pleasurable as we anticipate. There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. .an eternity of a lonely hell apart from every comfort and every glimpse of the Love and Glory of God. Choose wisely. I have long pondered this Psalm, especially the phrase, \"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.\" The thing which strikes me about it is what it doesn't say. It doesn't say \"through the valley of death.\" David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. Our dear friend Larry tells the story of his father's recent passing to Heaven. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" There was nothing better that could have been said. So let us have hope and not fear that passage before us. As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" We will have an easy, glorious journey home. My husband and I were traveling down the road and I commented about the color of a particular road sign. My husband thought I said \"sun\". He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. Because it has always been there, every morning, every day for as long as we, or anyone else for that matter, can remember. We have total and complete faith in the sun that it will continue to come up every morning and set every evening. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. I have seen many \"glimpses of love\" in my lifetime. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. I have watched as mother, and father, cry and joy over their new child. I have seen glimpses of love between my grandchildren. If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. Watching Jackson, I was glimpsing love. I see glimpses of love in the cup of coffee my husband so faithfully brings me every morning. Don't we enjoy seeing things like this? Don't they warm our heart and sometimes even bring tears to our eyes? It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. .we are somehow seeing glimpses of the love of God. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). Not only do we have water all around, but we have water from above, too. For the Deep South in the middle of September, that is a wonderful thing. The slight coolness of the air, that hint of crispness in the morning, is the hope of something yet to be. Snow is a rare, but celebrated thing here. More than \"winter\" we have an absence of summer, a respite from that heat and humidity. So these cool mornings and evenings are a hope of things yet to be. They are a promise of what will come. Feeling the relief of a cool breeze and a comfortable evening reminds me that these promises are like other promises we have been given. We have been given a whole book of promises of \". .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). As as we feel the cool morning that is a promise for the relief from summer heat, let it lift our hearts that there is a time coming when the heat of our hearts will be lifted as well. Let us have hope. \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. Although I have highly encouraged the dropping of the \"Grannie\" part, both the rhyme and my name is now set forever in the minds of my grandchildren. Emma seems to start every sentence with \"Grannie Frannie. .\" Sometimes I think I hear that name a thousand times in a weekend. I confess there are times I go to the bathroom just to be able to have a moment or two alone. Instead, the Scriptures tell us \". .the prayer of the upright is His delight,\" (Proverbs 15:8). Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). How wonderful to know that our voices are never old to Him, that He never wearies with our calling of His name. What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Especially when she says as she did this weekend, \"You are the best Grannie Frannie I've ever had! I love you, Grannie Frannie!\" I truthfully responded, \"I love you, too, Emma. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. .warm, sweet and irresistible. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\" The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. I remember one of the most touching scenes to me during that time was when the Star Spangled Banner was played at Buckingham Palace. The tribute to the United States by our closest friend and ally brought tears to my eyes...it still does eleven years later. Let us remember their honor and sacrifice. let all the people praise Thee.\" The thought was, I suppose, if Andy said it was that \"gooood\" then it had to be really good. Or as Andy Griffith would have said, \"He's real goooood!\" It is someone we know will be constant and true. In fact, He will be for us \"abundantly above all that we ask or think.\" Sometimes we wish for, as Clement Moore described in \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" a \"long winter's nap.\" There was little sleep. He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. The Lord of Heaven and earth holds us in His very hands. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. His courage defeats them and they pack up and leave. .it represented \"bigger people\". His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He watered them. He could tell you at any given time how many tomatoes were on the vines. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). We are the branches which grow upon the True Vine. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. \"But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\" (Philippians 4:19). If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I look back over the path and see His hand in the myriads of ways and times that I didn't understand then, but now it makes perfect sense. O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good: for His mercy endureth for ever.\" That's almost like an endless cup of coffee. Each Christmas couldn't come fast enough. The pace of time sped up. Then the frightening thought begins.. . It reminds me of the opening of an old soap-opera: \"Like sands through the hourglass so are the Days of our Lives.\" We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Our hourglass is never-ending, sort of like that endless cup of coffee of McDonald's. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. We will know no end. One day we will simply breathe out the air of this earth and breathe in the sweet fragrance of our Lord. And \"so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. We were apart during the spring, when everything feels young, even aged Saturn; however, none of the beauty I saw around me could bring me into sympathy with my surroundings. I could not admire the lily or the rose, since these were to me only images of you. Thus, it still seemed winter to me, since you were away. in blacks and reds. He wears a steel helmet, broad square face, open mouth with square teeth and a full black beard. ; 6) The Slave (Earth and Fire): A black African with large gold earrings and a ring through her nose; the lips are full and pink, the eyes half-closed, sultry and sensuous; the expression is warm and friendly. ; 7) The Child (Water and Air): A picture of innocence; a girl with delicate sweet smile and butterfly shaped bows at each side in her long golden hair; her eyes are large and watery and she has a delicate sweet smile on her mouth. She gives her flowers, which she puts on the nightstand. The final scene shows the couple as now elderly and living in the same apartment. The woman is first seen reading as the man comes in. He picks up his glasses and a newspaper and sits beside her. The man is then seen in bed; she comes over and kisses him and they smile at each other. It ends with a dedication to Tanya's parents (Beau and Juanita), who celebrated their 50th anniversary the year the video was made. I criticized the violet, telling it that it had stolen its sweet smell from my beloved's breath, and its purple color from my beloved's veins. I told the lily it had stolen the whiteness of your (that is, the beloved's) hands, and marjoram had stolen the beloved's hair; a third flower had stolen from both; in fact, all flowers had stolen something from the person of the beloved.\n\n"

The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance has worked to ensure that necessary treatments are covered by Medicare; that drugs and tests on the market are safe and effective; and that federal policy makers are aware of the importance of the ovarian cancer community. The National Center for Health Research (formerly the National Research Center for Women & Families) is a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization founded in 1999. The center educates patients, consumers, and health professionals through its articles, trainings, and media, and educates policymakers and analysts about the latest research at briefings, hearings, and meetings. The President of the National Center is Diana Zuckerman. The primary responsibility of the NCI is to coordinate the National Cancer Program. These programs focus on conducting cutting-edge research in various areas related to cancer biology, treatment modalities, prevention strategies, and supportive care. Additionally, the NCI provides funding to support cancer researchers throughout the United States. SEER began collecting data on cancer cases on January 1, 1973, in the states of Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, and the metropolitan areas of Detroit and San Francisco-Oakland. NCI staff work with the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) to guide all state \n\n disease orientation and categorical structure of the IRP had its genesis in the establishment of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1944. In 1948, Congress passed the National Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, and soon after established institutes for research on mental health, oral diseases, neurological problems, and blindness. Today, the IRP consists of individual programs housed in 23 of the NIH Institutes and Centers, creating a network of multi-disciplinary, federally funded laboratories with an emphasis on translational research.\n\n"

They're not vaccines to prevent an infection, but drugs to limit its impact. How does a new virus develop? Another possibility is gene-swapping. This can happen when a cell is infected by viruses from different creatures, say a chicken and a pig. In the new strain of H1N1 virus, pieces of human, bird and pig genes are all scrambled up. How does this H1N1 virus differ from the H1N1 that caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919?

So far, H1N1 is not as virulent as the previous strain, but that could change. Hence they are rushing to develop a vaccine by this fall. How does H1N1 virus jump from animals to humans? Usually the H protein on a pig or bird virus doesn't fit easily into the receptor of a human cell. So a person exposed to such a virus is unlikely to get infected. This gives rise to a new strain of H1N1 that's adapted to humans. Contact with infected pigs or birds no longer is necessary. How does one person catch H1N1 from others?

A H1N1 flu is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by the influenza A virus. It causes high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs.

It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Any abnormality in teeth directly hampers the first look and diastema is one of the most common abnormalities seen in teeth. Diastema is usually a midline space between front two teeth, also seen in posterior teeth. In simple words, Diastema is the gap between teeth. Anterior spaces may interfere with smile, attractiveness and compromise facial esthetics. Diastema is among the most frequent reasons why patients seek orthodontic treatment. Diastema is a prominent gap between two teeth. It is most commonly seen between central incisors (your front teeth) and sometimes between molars (posterior teeth). Diastema is common in milk teeth or primary dentition because of altering teeth and jaw sizes as we grow up. The gap between teeth can be corrected with the orthodontic intervention which falls under the branch of corrective orthodontics. It is a simple procedure and involves the use of brackets, stainless steel wires and elastics depending upon the extent of the diastema and overall condition of the jaws. Periodontally speaking, if there is an overgrowth in the surrounding tissue of the affected teeth, that is, the overgrowth of gums or attached gingiva, unwanted space is created between the teeth leading to diastema formation. Gum diseases like Gingivitis and Periodontitis that is, inflammation of gums and surrounding tooth structure, respectively, can also lead to the gap between teeth or diastema. Periodontitis, on the other hand, affects structures surrounding the teeth, majorly underlying bone structure. Because of compromised bone structure and periodontal ligaments, mobility appears in teeth, hence the drifting and diastema. In cases of high frenal attachments, frenectomy can be done. This is a simple procedure that relieves the pressure on the teeth and drifting stops. In all of the cases mentioned above, after treating the underlying causes, fixed orthodontic therapy should be done followed by retention appliances. So, if you have a void in your dental arch, then visit your dentist as soon as possible. If you want to maintain a good esthetics, then the gap between teeth shouldn’t be ignored as our jaws expand over time. Over the period, the size of the diastema might enlarge and cause functional problems. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. To address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps. Gaps can occur between any teeth, but for those with large gaps between the front facing teeth, dental gaps can be a source of self-consciousness. What Causes Gaps between Teeth? Size mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. Porcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments. Dental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps. Dental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth. Older children and adults will generally require additional treatment, like braces, to close gaps after a frenectomy. A diastema (plural diastemata, from greek διάστημα, space) is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bal mithai (Kumaoni: बाल मिठाई) is a brown chocolate-like fudge, made with roasted khoya, coated with white sugar balls, and is a popular sweet from the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in India, especially regions around Kumaon. Crops most commonly associated with Uttarakhand are Buckwheat (locally called Kotu or Kuttu) and the regional crops, Maduwa and Jhangora, particularly in the interior regions of Kumaon and Garhwal. Generally, either Desi Ghee or Mustard oil is used for the purpose of cooking food. Simple recipes are made interesting with the use of hash seeds Jakhya as spice, chutney made of Bhang is also a regional cuisine. Other popular dishes include Dubuk, Chains, Kap, Bhatiya, Jaula, Phana, Paliyo, Chutkani and Sei. Sohan halwa (Urdu سوہن حلوہ; ) is a traditional dessert in South Asia, which is a variety of dense, sweet confection or halwa. Gheewala halwa is popular for sohan halwa since the Mughal era. There are hundreds of shops that produce sohan halwa in the cities of Multan (Punjab), Dera Ismail Khan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), and Old Delhi. Ghee is used to prevent it from sticking to the pan.\n\n"

Reppert (born September 4, 1946) is an American neuroscientist known for his contributions to the fields of chronobiology and neuroethology. He was the Higgins Family Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts Medical School from 2001 to 2017, and from 2001 to 2013 was the founding chair of the Department of Neurobiology. He is currently distinguished professor emeritus of neurobiology. Biography\n\nEarly life\nSteven Reppert grew up in the village of Pender, Nebraska, and graduated from Pender Public High School in 1964. His interest in science began in childhood with the cecropia moth—an insect made famous by Harvard biologist Carroll M. Williams, who used the moth in his pioneering work on the role of juvenile hormone in molting and metamorphosis. Education and career\nReppert received his BS and MD in 1973 (with distinction) from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine and was elected as a medical student to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society. From 1973 to 1976 he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1976 to 1979 Reppert was a postdoctoral fellow in neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, in David C. Klein's laboratory, which focuses on the pineal gland and circadian biology. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals. To determine the function of mPER1–3, Reppert and colleagues disrupted the three genes encoding them. This work provided the first portrayal of a negative transcriptional feedback loop as the major gear driving the mouse molecular clock. In 1995, Reppert cloned and characterized the Mel1b melatonin receptor. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2. Monarch butterfly migration\n\nSince 2002, Reppert and coworkers have pioneered the study of the biological basis of monarch butterfly migration. Each fall, millions of monarchs from the eastern United States and southeastern Canada migrate as much as 4,000 km to overwinter in roosts in Central Mexico. Monarch migration is not a learned activity, given that migrants flying south are at least two generations removed from the previous year's migrants. Thus, migrating monarchs must have some genetically based navigational mechanism. 24 hours later, CRY2 returns to the nucleus and inhibits CLK:CYC transcription. Meanwhile, PER is progressively phosphorylated, which may aid CRY2 translocation into the nucleus. The temperature microenvironment at the overwintering site is essential for successful completion of the migration cycle: without cold exposure, aged migrants continue to orient to the south. The discovery that coldness triggers the northward flight direction in spring remigrants underscores how vulnerable the migration may be to climate change. The goal of the project was to make genomic and proteomic information about monarch butterflies accessible to biological and lepidopteran communities. Targeted mutagenesis of Cry2 indeed resulted in the in vivo disruption of circadian behavior and the molecular clock mechanism. In 2016, Reppert collaborated with Marcus Kronforst at the University of Chicago and others to use population genetic studies to define the evolutionary history of the monarch migration. She has researched how seasonal migration of these butterflies affects parasite transmission, and also developed collaborative databases of mammalian infectious diseases, on host behavior, ecology, and life history interact with global-scale patterns of parasitism. She also focused her research on songbird-pathogen dynamics, including studies of house finch conjunctivitis, West Nile virus, and salmonellosis. Altizer has published several publications and she recently co-edited a book that would be published in 2015, titled Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Insect.

This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the \"Bountygate Game\" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season.

In a 2018 retrospective, Sports Illustrated called the 1998 Vikings \"The Greatest Team Never to Make It.\" The loss had a dramatic effect on Minnesota sports culture, as the 1998 Vikings were considered the team most likely to deliver a Super Bowl championship to a franchise that had already suffered multiple heartbreaking defeats. This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the \"Bountygate Game\" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season. In a 1975 Divisional round playoff game, the Vikings lost to the Dallas Cowboys as a result of a 50-yard touchdown pass from Roger Staubach to \n\n an NFC divisional game, on January 14, 2018, as the Vikings hosted the New Orleans Saints. The Vikings won the game 29–24 on a last second 61-yard catch by wide receiver Stefon Diggs, in a play that became known as the Minneapolis Miracle. The Vikings then advanced to the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, where the Vikings lost 38–7, costing the Vikings the chance to become the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its own home stadium. Super Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots with the Eagles winning 41-33 for their first Super Bowl win.\n\n"
