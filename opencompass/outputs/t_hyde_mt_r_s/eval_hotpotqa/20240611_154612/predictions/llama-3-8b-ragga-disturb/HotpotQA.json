John Philip Sousa's \"Kansas Wildcats March,\" written for the school, is Kansas State's official march.\n\n"

He was admired by Arthur Machen and later by the poet Robin Skelton. His Selected Poems was published in 1936. He associated with the Sitwells, but was no modernist. Roth was born in Saarmund (a part of what is now Nuthetal), Brandenburg-Prussia, on 3 February 1726; he died in York, Pa. on 22 July 1791. Roth made a special study of the Unami dialect of the Lenape language, and composed in it an extensive religious work, \"The History of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,\" four fifths of which were lost by 1885. Only the last part survives: \"From Passion Week to his Ascension to Heaven\" (Ein Versuch der Geschichte unsers Herrn u. Heylandes Jesu Christi in das Delawarische übersetzt der Unami, von der Marter-Woche an bis zur Himmelfahrt unsers Herrn, im Yahr 1770 u.

Roth published Rage in Singapore as a work of non-fiction, and claimed that Plotkin \"was at Penang with his wife when the Japs captured the island.\" In September 1941, Roth paid Plotkin \"for translating Hitler's manuscript\" which appeared in print (with an introduction by Upton Sinclair) as Hitler's Doctor, one of Roth's best-selling books.

Hunt, 18 February 2007) ; Warren Buffett (successful Billionaire investor) who said in one investor letter: \"Getting fired can produce a particularly bountiful payday for a CEO, Indeed, he can 'earn' more in that single day, while cleaning out his desk, than an American worker earns in a lifetime of cleaning toilets. Forget the old maxim about nothing succeeding like success: Today, in the executive suite, the all-too-prevalent rule is that nothing succeeds like failure.\" In the late 1990s, investor Warren Buffett lamented that \"there is no question in my mind that mediocre CEOs are getting incredibly overpaid. And the way it's being done is through stock options.\" Since executives control much of the information available to outside investors they have the ability to fabricate the appearance of success—\"aggressive accounting, fictitious transactions that inflate sales, whatever it takes\"—to increase their compensation.\n\n"

In June 2001, Activision announced that they would be releasing the second Tomb Raider game for the Game Boy Color, titled Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword, on 25 June. The game utilises the game engine used for the first Tomb Raider handheld game, and would feature \"new challenges, puzzles and enemies to conquer.\" According to Craig Harris of IGN, the game sees \"Lara Croft get[ out of the ruins and into the cities as her adventure takes place in locations such as New York and New Orleans.\" Jamie Morton and Paul Field were served as level designers. The graphics and animations were done by Matt Charlesworth; additional graphics for backgrounds and cutscenes were handled by Fergus Duggan and Paschal McGuire, respectively. The film industry in particular took notice and capitalized on how they could integrate video games into their storytelling. The 2000s however began to show promise in the profitability and success of making video game-based films. Opening in 2001, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider became the highest-grossing video game adaptation with over a US$274 million box office\n\n"

In subsequent years it was installed on several lighthouses and beacons, but because of its dependence on liquid it could only be used in static locations (unlike Dalén's valves, very many of which were installed on floating buoys).

Following the Roman withdrawal from Britain, local civilians took over the fort, and the Latinized Celtic name continued to be used well into the Saxon period. This year came Ælle to Britain, with his three sons, Cymen, and Wlenking, and Cissa, in three ships; landing at a place that is called Cymenshore. There they slew many of the Welsh; and some in flight they drove into the \n\n might be remembered in British legend as Mark of Cornwall. By AD 500, possibly the time described by Gildas, Anglo-Saxons controlled the Isle of Wight, Kent, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, and coastal areas of Northumberland and Yorkshire. In the south were the British (Brythonic-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of \"The Old North\", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was Alt Clut. Finally, the Anglo-Saxons had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of Bernicia (later the northern part of Northumbria), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.\n\n"

A large influx of Catholic settlers arrived in New Brunswick in 1845 from Ireland as a result of the Great Famine. They headed to the cities of Saint John or Chatham, which to this day calls itself the \"Irish Capital of Canada\". Combined with a decade of economic distress in New Brunswick, the immigration of poor unskilled labourers triggered a nativist response. By the end of the 17th century, First Nations from the northeastern woodlands, eastern subarctic and the Métis (a people of joint First Nations and European descent ) had rapidly adopted the use of firearms, supplanting the traditional bow.

They headed to the cities of Saint John or Chatham, which to this day calls itself the \"Irish Capital of Canada\". Combined with a decade of economic distress in New Brunswick, the immigration of poor unskilled labourers triggered a nativist response. By the end of the 17th century, First Nations from the northeastern woodlands, eastern subarctic and the Métis (a people of joint First Nations and European descent ) had rapidly adopted the use of firearms, supplanting the traditional bow. The Council maintained relations with other nations, both fellow Anishinaabeg: the Ozaagii (Sac), Odagaamii (Meskwaki), Omanoominii (Menominee), and non-Anishinaabeg: Wiinibiigoo (Ho-Chunk), Naadawe (Iroquois Confederacy), Nii'inaa-Naadawe (Wyandot), Naadawensiw (Sioux), Wemitigoozhi (France), Zhaaganaashi (England) and the Gichi-mookomaan (the United States).

The Fenian raids (1866–1871) were carried out by groups of Irish Americans, mostly Union Army veterans from the American Civil War who believed that by seizing Canada, concessions could be wrung from the British government regarding their policy in Ireland. The Fenians had also incorrectly assumed that Irish Canadians, who were quite numerous in Canada, would support their invasive efforts both politically and militarily.\n\n"

Kennedy collected the tale from a man named Garrett (Gerald) Forrestal, residing in the former barony of Bantry, in Wexford. The Kennedys belonged to the powerful Dál gCais people of Thomond, headed by the O'Briens. Placenames such as Coolkennedy and Garrykennedy in Upper \n\n and Killokennedy in Thomond are indicative of their longstanding presence in the region. Around 1600, a branch of the sept migrated to Co. Antrim where many Kennedys are still found today. According to Daithi O'hOgain (Associate Professor at University College Dublin), there is a lineage of Irish Kennedys descended directly from Brian Boru: \"The name Cinneide also continued in the direct O'Brien line. These were known by the synonym Muimhneach (\"Munster-man\"), which is anglicised as the surnames Mimnagh and Minnagh.\" To add to the confusion, there are the Kennedys of nine-county Ulster in the north of Ireland.

Kennedy collected the tale from a man named Garrett (Gerald) Forrestal, residing in the former barony of Bantry, in Wexford. The Kennedys belonged to the powerful Dál gCais people of Thomond, headed by the O'Briens. Placenames such as Coolkennedy and Garrykennedy in Upper \n\n and Killokennedy in Thomond are indicative of their longstanding presence in the region. Around 1600, a branch of the sept migrated to Co. Antrim where many Kennedys are still found today. According to Daithi O'hOgain (Associate Professor at University College Dublin), there is a lineage of Irish Kennedys descended directly from Brian Boru: \"The name Cinneide also continued in the direct O'Brien line. These were known by the synonym Muimhneach (\"Munster-man\"), which is anglicised as the surnames Mimnagh and Minnagh.\" To add to the confusion, there are the Kennedys of nine-county Ulster in the north of Ireland. The Kennedys who settled in Ulster are mostly of Scottish origin from the territories of Galloway and Ayr just across the Irish Sea 20 mi away.\n\n"

The 1993–94 double-winners Doncaster Belles and League Cup winners Arsenal Ladies continued their rivalry in the National Division. The runners-up were Liverpool Ladies, renamed in 1994 and previously known as Knowsley United. The showpiece event was the fourth to be played directly under the auspices of the Football Association (FA) and was known as the UK Living FA Women's Cup Final for sponsorship reasons. Millwall Lionesses and Wembley contested the match at West Ham United's Upton Park in London on 4 May 1997. Millwall Lionesses made their second final appearance, after winning the trophy in 1991 with a 1–0 win over Doncaster Belles at Prenton Park. Wembley appeared in the final for the first time, having won the previous season's FA Women's Premier League Cup competition. As FA Women's Premier League National Division clubs, both teams entered the competition at the fourth round stage. Doncaster Rovers Belles were relegated to WSL 2, with nine new licences awarded to London Bees, Durham, Aston Villa, Millwall Lionesses, Yeovil Town, Reading, Sunderland, Watford, and Oxford United.

MGM hoped \n\n position the grounds as a site for festivals, concerts, and sporting events (such as boxing, mixed martial arts, and soccer) as a complement to its other venues in the area. In October 2015, the MGM Resorts branding was dropped and the site was renamed to simply Las Vegas Festival Grounds. The renaming was part of an effort to downplay MGM's role in the venue to improve its marketability for third-party events and to brand the site as being part of Las Vegas's \"community\". MGM sold the property to Phil Ruffin, along with the neighboring Circus Circus hotel and casino, in 2019.\n\n"
