The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. During late 2011 and early 2012 the Libyan team wore white jerseys temporarily in their qualification games and 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. The flag of the Federation of Arab Republics was the flag of Egypt, Libya and Syria from 1972–1977. The flag is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and black with a golden Hawk of Quraish placed on the center on the white stripe. The flag was abandoned in Libya in 1977 after Muammar Gaddafi established the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and adopted a green flag. Egypt and Syria continue to still used the flag of the FAR until the early 1980s. Syria adopted a new flag in 1980 and Egypt in 1984.

The town lies on both sides of the road from Niamey to Dallol Bosso. Kouré is best known for West African giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta), an endemic subspecies of West Africa. Nouakchott (نواكشوط;, originally derived from , \"place of the winds\") is the capital and largest city of Mauritania. Nouakchott was a mid-sized village of little importance until 1958, when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. However, beginning in the 1970s, a vast number of Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott because environmental conditions in their home villages had become too harsh due to drought and increasing desertification. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports. It also hosts the University of Nouakchott and several other more specialized institutions of higher learning. There are government hospitals in Niamey (with three main hospitals in Niamey, including the Hôpital National de Niamey and the Hôpital National De Lamordé), Maradi, Tahoua, Zinder and other large cities, with smaller medical clinics in most towns.

The convoluted plot revolves around the misadventures of the title character (whose first name sports the extra \"a\" dropped by Barbra Streisand from her own) and her journey from a Brooklyn fish market to fame as a Hollywood gossip columnist, and then a career culminating in an Academy Award nomination and a nervous breakdown.

According to musicologist Walter Everett, the Beatles' \"experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts\" on their albums Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966) \"encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s\".

Author Martin Caidin, according to The Bionic Book by Herbie Pilato, served as an uncredited consultant for the series throughout its run, and ultimately made a brief appearance in one of its final-season episodes; in addition, author Jay Barbree, who collaborated with Caidin on a number of nonfiction book projects, also wrote a novel based upon the series.

The second book featured Captain Nemo and the Nautilus presumed lost in the maelstrom at the end of that novel. In The Mysterious Island (1874) after the escapees' balloon landed on the island, among many adventures, they encountered Ayrton alive, fought the pirates and discovered that Captain Nemo was their benefactor and the island the base for the Nautilus.

It received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers, but was enormously popular with the public, having been reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908, and has seen various adaptations into musicals, opera, theatre, plays and music. Painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti reputedly became convinced that the poem was about him. Time passes and fortunately Goldilocks comes around, with only a bump on the head to show for her trouble.

Gertrude Chataway's name appears in this form at the beginning of The Hunting of the Snark, and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her. Information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858–1862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing \n\n this point the story must shift to the Agent in the picket ship, who calls himself \"Mr. Carroll\", a Lewis Carroll reference as one of the planets of the Warden system is named \"Momrath\" with a moon named \"Boojum\" from Carroll's poem \"The Hunting of the Snark\".\n\nQuestion: In Lewis Carroll's poem The Hunting of the Snark, what did the elusive, troublesome snark turn into to fool hunters?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is also generally recognized as the last heavyweight champion of bare-knuckle boxing under the London Prize Ring Rules, being a cultural icon of the late 19th century America, arguably the first boxing superstar and one of the world's highest-paid athletes of his era.

It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, \n\n naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on his 4 year-expedition from 1839 to 1843. Commanding the British ships Erebus and Terror, he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the Ross Ice Shelf, a massive floating ice shelf over 100 ft high. His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: Mount Erebus, the most active volcano on Antarctica, and Mount Terror. The first documented landing on the mainland of East Antarctica was at Victoria Land by the American sealer Mercator \n\n Crean and William Lashly. Bellingshausen and Lazarev became the first explorers to see and officially discover the land of the continent of Antarctica. Three days later, on 30 January 1820, a British expedition captained by Irishman Edward Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, and ten months later an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer sighted Antarctica on 17 November 1820. The first landing was probably just over a year later when American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice. The expedition was accompanied by several naturalists (including Williams Speirs Bruce) and an artist, William Gordon Burn Murdoch. Following on from that expedition, the specific impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given\n\nQuestion: Otis Barton was a pioneer in exploring where?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In comparative mythology as well, horned dragons are generally more common than hornless ones. Based upon the chishou \"hornless-dragon head\" roof adornment, Kroll translates chi as wyvern, \"a footed winged dragon with a serpent's tail, becoming in medieval times an oft-pictured heraldic beast.\" Two other Japanese examples derive from Buddhist importations of Indian dragon myths.

De Visser says the number 8 is \"stereotypical\" \n\n The dragon has been used as totem creature in the region of Lleida since the 5th century BC. He is the oldest literary representation of the wild man, a recurrent motif in artistic representations in Mesopotamia and in Ancient Near East literature.

Multi-headed dragons, like the 8-headed Orochi and 3-headed Trisiras above, are a common motif in comparative mythology.

Berry Gordy and Motown subsequently decided to shelve the album, and Ross' next release was the more pop-orientated Touch Me in the Morning (1973) album. biggest-selling single of the year in the US. The duet single was released by Motown Records worldwide since both artists were still signed to that label at the time, and in effect, became the most successful single in Motown history. It however became Ross' final hit single for the label; shortly thereafter, she signed a then record-breaking $20 million deal with RCA Records.

The special effects were produced by Industrial Light & Magic, with make-up effects by Rob Bottin. Rushed into production, the film was never properly finished. Dante revealed that the studio demanded that he stop editing and rush for a July release where it was overshadowed by the Live Aid concert, which was held one day after the film's release and stiff competition from Back to the Future, which opened nine days prior. Both Hawke and Phoenix make their feature film debuts. Phoenix was originally considered to play Darren, but when Dante chose Jason Presson to play him, Dante thought he was good enough to play another role so he cast him against type as the nerdy Wolfgang. Cherie Currie was considered for a part but, according to her autobiography, she was in the throes of drug dependency and could not even make it to a meeting. Parker, Coburn and others in the cast were working on other projects during the making of the film and would repeatedly show up in the nick of time and do their lines without makeup and little or no rehearsal. The film grossed $34.6 million in North America against a production budget of $15 million.

Daley was elected to a record sixth term as mayor by a landslide 59% margin. Only one other individual (Daley's son Richard M. Daley) has matched Daley's feat of winning six Chicago mayoral elections. While Byrne had previously, in 1979, presented herself as a protegee of former mayor Richard J. Daley, she now blamed him for many of the city's financial shortcomings. Daley's own son Richard M. Daley capitalized off a desire which many Chicagoans held (despite Byrne's criticisms) to return to what they perceived to have been comparatively stable years which the city had experienced under Richard J.

Despite there being a black candidate in the race, the Chicago Defender endorsed Daley, as did noted African American publisher John H. Johnson.

John Lancaster (born 18 April 1946) is a British poet and writer. Its name was coined by the English cartoonist and author Osbert Lancaster, as Curzon Street in Mayfair was an address popular with London high society. Waldo Sullivan Lanchester (6 May 1897 – 15 December 1978) was a British puppeteer who founded the Lanchester Marionettes (1935-1962), a puppet theatre that was based in Malvern, and later in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote a book on the revival of puppeteering and commissioned George Bernard Shaw to write his last completed play Shakes versus Shav in 1949. In 1952, Donald W. Seager wrote that \"Waldo Lanchester has consistently been associated with all that is best in the puppet theatre.\" Archibald Henderson called him \"England's greatest puppetmaster.\" In 2008 the architectural historian Gavin Stamp described Osbert Lancaster's Pillar to Post (1938)—later revised and combined with the sequel Homes Sweet Homes (1939)—as \"one of the most influential books on architecture ever published–and certainly the funniest\". Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, \"a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice.\"\n\nQuestion: What is Osbert Lancaster best known for producing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Amundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the Bay of Whales to the polar plateau via the Axel Heiberg Glacier. The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station was later named after these two men. During the expedition, Shackleton was the first to reach the polar plateau. Their goal was \"to get as far south in a straight line on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land\". The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78°50′. Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had been associated with the Discovery Expedition's scientific work. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme was complicated by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas. Hillary's party reached the South Pole on 3 January 1958, and was just the third (preceded by Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912) to reach the Pole overland. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching Scott Base, completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole.\n\nQuestion: Who was the first person after Scott to reach the South Pole overland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It declared that \"an atmosphere of atrocity\" surrounded the event, concluding that a massacre had taken place and the crime had been covered up by the commander of the Americal Division and his executive officer. Although My Lai generated a lot of civilian recriminations and bad publicity for the military, it was not the only massacre. I was right about the bloodbath in Vietnam, so I assumed I would be right about Cambodia.\" Australian Ben Kiernan recanted after interviewing 500 Cambodian refugees in 1979. He admitted that he had been \"late in recognizing the extent of the tragedy in Cambodia ...and wrong about ...the brutal authoritarian trend within the revolutionary movement after 1973.\" In the opinion of Donald W. Beachler, the genocide deniers and doubters among academics may have been motivated more by politics than a search for the truth, but conservatives who \"embraced the reports\" of Khmer Rouge atrocities had no less \"cynicism or naiveté\" in later downplaying reports of atrocities \n\n William R. Peers was appointed by the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff to conduct a thorough review of the My Lai Massacre. On March 16, 1968, three companies of Task Force Barker, part of the Americal Division, took part in a search and destroy operation near the village of My Lai, in Quang Ngai Province.

Speaking of the song's titular character, MacColl told Smash Hits in 1983: \"Terry seems to be a really good name for a lovable rogue. With it, Cohen wanted to \"make a definitive statement about the heroic enterprise of the craft\" of songwriting. In the early eighties, he called the work \"Raise My Voice in Song.\" His concern was with the aging songwriter, and the \"necessity to transcend one's own failure by manifesting as the singer, as the songwriter.\" He had abandoned the song, but one night in Montreal he finished the lyrics and called an engineer and recorded it in one take with a toy synthesizer. \"Tower of Song\" is a song written by Leonard Cohen that appears on his 1988 \n\n \"American Jerusalem\" is a song written by singer-songwriter and guitarist Rod MacDonald in 1978. Considered his \"signature tune\", the nearly-six-minute long song first appeared on MacDonald’s 1983 debut album No Commercial Traffic (originally on Cinemagic Records, reissued by Blue Flute Music). The song was written in collaboration between Cross, pop music composer Burt Bacharach, and Bacharach's frequent writing partner and then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. A fourth writing credit went to Minnelli's ex-husband, Australian songwriter Peter Allen, also a frequent collaborator with Bayer Sager: the line \"When you get caught between the moon and New York City\" from the chorus was taken from an unreleased song Allen and Bayer Sager had previously written together. Allen came up with the line while his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at John F.

The 1967 album release Pet Project by the Bob Florence Big Band features an instrumental version of \"Round Every Corner\", the album being devoted to songs associated with Petula Clark. The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan and the Breakaways vocal group. Beginning with her American breakout, \"Downtown,\" Clark's singles had all had higher chart peaks in the US than in the UK. Although this trend was reversed with Clark's next single: \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\" (UK #6/US #9), Clark's last two 1966 single releases: \"Who Am I?\" It was recorded in 1965 by Petula Clark at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured drummer Bobby Graham and the Breakaways vocal group. Released as the follow-up to \"Downtown\", which it strongly resembles both in musical structure and the story conveyed by the lyrics, \"I Know a Place\" became Clark's second consecutive Top Ten hit in the United States, remaining on the charts for twelve weeks. (Clark would subsequently peak at #47 UK with 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' in 1972 and in 1988 a remix of her 1964 recording 'Downtown' would peak at #10 UK.) A follow-up to the transatlantic Top Ten hit \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\", \"Who Am I\" peaked at #21 in the US in November 1966 and failed to chart in Clark's native UK, as did the follow-up US Top 20 single \"Colour My World\". \"Who Am I \" was Clark's first post-\"Downtown\" single\n\nQuestion: Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sutherland graduated from Bridgewater High School. He then studied at Victoria University, an affiliated college of the University of Toronto, where he met his first wife Lois May Hardwick (not to be confused with the child star of the same name Lois Ann Hardwick), and graduated with a double major in engineering and drama. Sutherland rose to fame after starring in films including The Dirty Dozen (1967), M*A*S*H (1970), Kelly's Heroes (1970), Klute (1971), Don't Look Now (1973), Fellini's Casanova (1976), 1900 (1976), The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Animal House (1978), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Ordinary People (1980), and Eye of the Needle (1981).

The peach went from feral trees utilized opportunistically to a tended commercial crop in the Southern United States in the 1850s, as the boll weevil attacked regional cotton crops. When Georgia reached peak production in the 1920s, elaborate festivals celebrated the fruit. Both Peaches' father and her mother gave their permission for the marriage, which took place in part to thwart a campaign by Vincent Pisarra of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to halt the May/December relationship. On October 2, 1926, Peaches and her mother loaded up their belongings and left the marital residence at the Kew Gardens Inn. Horticulturist George Minifie supposedly brought the first peaches from England to its North American colonies in the early 17th century, planting them at his estate of Buckland in Virginia.

She became a prostitute in Van Buren, Arkansas ostensibly to make money for the purpose of getting her brother out of prison. Starr moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas and established her own bordello. Located on \"the Row,\" Fort Smith's waterfront street of gambling halls, saloons and bordellos, the house was identified with a bright red star surrounded by lighted pearls. The parlor featured a talented piano player, good whiskey, and supposedly the \"most beautiful girls west of the Mississippi.\" She and Brady had visited the Arlington Hotel in Hot Springs, Arkansas and she witnessed first hand a luxurious lifestyle and resolved to emulate it back at her brothel. She changed the name to the \"Chateau Lobrano d'Arlington\" and began to hire foreign girls to increase the appeal to upscale customers. At this point, she began making business deals with Tom Anderson who operated a nearby restaurant which he renamed the Arlington. Anderson caught wind of Alderman Story's ordinance to create a regulated prostitution district before most did, and he and Josie acquired choice properties on Basin Street near the entrance to the future Storyville area.\n\nQuestion: What was the name of the brothel in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Shortly after, Sid Ahmed Ghlam, an Algerian student, sought medical help in Paris for bullet wounds in one of his arms. His behaviour raised suspicions, leading French authorities to check his car, a Renault Mégane where they found a Kalashnikov rifle, a revolver and a bullet proof vest.

At the time of construction of the Dam, Boulder City sheltered more than 4,000 employees in 1500 buildings from 1931 to 1935. The dam was built to provide hydroelectricity and regulate the flow of the river from the upper Colorado River Basin into the lower. The Lake Powell reservoir is the second largest artificial lake in the country, extending upriver well into Utah. The dam is named for Glen Canyon, a colorful series of gorges, most of which now are buried under the reservoir. By taming floods that were characteristic of the Colorado River, the dam has led to major physical and ecological changes in the lower river. The Hoover Dam is a massive concrete arch-gravity dam, constructed in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border between the US states of Arizona and Nevada between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression. Such a large concrete structure had never been built before, and some of the techniques \n\n On 21st December 1928, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Boulder Canyon Project Act approving the construction of Hoover Dam and the formation of Boulder City.

The Boulder Canyon Project Federal Reservation as well as the federal rangers obeyed law \n\n Glen Canyon Dam, a concrete arch dam on the Colorado River in the American state of Arizona, is viewed as carrying a large amount of risk, most notably due to siltation.

Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. The victory took the overall record in the event to 40&ndash;38 in Oxford's favour. Returning runners from 1924 included silver medalist Romeo Bertini of Italy, bronze medalist Clarence DeMar of the United States, fifth-place finisher Sam Ferris of Great Britain, sixth-place finisher Manuel Plaza of Chile, seventh-place finisher Boughera El Ouafi of France, and eighth-place finisher Gustav Kinn of Sweden. The first organized college sports club was formed in 1843 when Yale University created a boat club. Harvard University then followed in their footsteps, creating a similar boat club a year later. This event took place in 1852, when the rowing team from Yale competed against the rowing team from Harvard at Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. This historic race sparked the venerable rivalry between the two schools, and the Yale-Harvard Regatta is considered the cornerstone of \n\n This was the third appearance of the marathon event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics.

The 78th Boat Race took place on 27 March 1926. Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames.

It was designed by the Austrian architect Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The heart of the garden was a courtyard surrounded by a three-tiered loggia, which served as a theater for entertainments. The Venetian Ambassador described the Cortile del Belvedere in 1523: \"One enters a very beautiful garden, of which half is filled with growing grass and bays and mulberries and cypresses, while the other half is paved with squares of bricks laid upright, and in every square a beautiful orange \n\n public. The impression evokes the two marble halls in the Upper and Lower Belvedere. Hildebrandt used the best available artists for the decoration. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ altarpiece was painted by Neapolitan painter Francesco Solimena over a period of ten years and completed in 1729. A model of Solimena's altarpiece by Santino Bussi is displayed in the hall next to the chapel. The Galerie Neue Meister (, New Masters Gallery) in Dresden, Germany, displays around 300 paintings from the 19th century until today, including works from Otto Dix, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet. The gallery also exhibits a number of sculptures from the Dresden Sculpture Collection from the same period. The museum's collection grew out of the Old Masters Gallery, for which contemporary works were increasingly purchased after 1843.\n\nQuestion: In which European city is the Belvederen Gallery?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was picked by Woody Herman shortly before Herman's death and has led the band since 1987. He had a period in the late 1960s when he was a studio musician, although by 1969 he was hired as Herman's lead saxophone soloist. After graduating, he toured with the Jack Gillespie Band from Minneapolis then joined the Lee Castle/Jimmy Dorsey Band. In 1965, Neumann enrolled at the Berklee School of Music. After two years at Berklee, he was offered a job by Woody Herman to join Herman's Thundering Herd, with whom he toured for the balance of that year. Horace Steadman \"Steady\" Nelson (1913&mdash;1988), born in Jefferson, Texas, was a 20th-century American musician who specialized in Jazz and Swing during the Big Band era. He recorded over 60 sessions on trumpet and vocals with Woody Herman, Hal McIntyre, the Casa Loma Orchestra, Horace Hiedt, the NBC Radio orchestra and others. https://web.archive.org/web/20081006192834/http://www.art-dir.com/Steady%20Nelson%20Bio.htm\n\n Inspired by witnessing a 1932 concert that featured \"an electrifying performance by a brilliant female violinist,\" Spitalny disbanded a male orchestra that he directed and began a tour of the United States, seeking female musicians for a new orchestra. His expenditure of $40,000 and auditions of 1,500 women produced a 32-member orchestra that debuted at the Capitol Theatre in New York City in 1934. The musicians usually ranged in age from 17 to 30, and most were single. A retrospective newspaper article about Spitalny published in 1958 noted \"ridicule from all sides in show business and ... sour comments from his musician brothers that he was 'crazy'\" as he created \"the first all-girl band of any consequence ever organized.\"\n\nQuestion: How old was Woody Herman when he founded his own orchestra?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The bridge stands 150 feet above the Nanaimo River; over 260,000 people have jumped since the site opened in 1990. Besides bungee jumping, WildPlay parks are made up of treetop activities involving high-ropes and obstacle climbing, swinging, and ziplining. In 1990, a permanent platform for bungee jumping was established by A. J. Hackett atop the highest pillar. The first parachute tower in the United States was a 115 ft tower in Ocean County, New Jersey, built by Stanley Switlik and first used by Amelia Earhart on 2 June 1935. The 262 feet Parachute Jump ride at the 1939 New York World's Fair (later moved to Coney Island) was a parachute tower, though the United States Army parachute training centre at Fort Benning had only 34 feet towers until 1941. Major William Lee of the United States Army, in charge of the training of the first 48-man platoon of US paratroopers, saw the Parachute Jump ride and constructed a similar tower at Fort Benning. While they initially offered traditional bungee jumping from a crane, their focus was to develop an idea Kitchen had for a safer alternative to bungee jumping that could be easily installed in amusement parks. The bridge is mainly used for commercial purposes by the AJ Hackett Bungy Company for bungy jumping - the world's first commercial bungy jumping site.\n\nQuestion: In which country was the first permanent bungee jumping site situated?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill. The stabilization policy brought about after Khrushchev's removal established a ruling gerontocracy, and political corruption became a normal phenomenon. Brezhnev, however, never initiated any large-scale anti-corruption campaigns. Due to the large military buildup of the 1960s the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower during Brezhnev's rule. The era ended \n\n On the day Khrushchev left for his vacation, East German Premier Willi Stoph made a sudden visit to Moscow and commenced an intensive three-day series of talks with Kosygin and other high-level Kremlin leaders. Suslov made a flat no-sell-out pledge in Moscow on the same day (5 October) that Brezhnev was welcomed in East Berlin by Ulbricht, who had refused to greet Khrushchev's son-in law two months earlier. Leonid Brezhnev, its foremost representative, died in 1982 aged 75, but had suffered a heart attack in 1975, after which generalized arteriosclerosis set in, so that he was progressively infirm and had trouble speaking.\n\nQuestion: Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Spock had mothers advised to raise their infants according to their own common sense and with plenty of physical contact – a guideline that radically broke with the preceding doctrines of L. Emmett Holt and John B. Watson; the book became a bestseller, and Spock's new child rearing concept greatly influenced the upbringing of the post-war generations. She argued that infants, speaking in terms of evolution, have not arrived in the modernity yet, so that today's way of child care – with bottle feeding, use of cribs and baby carriages, etc. Mothers placed the child in the cylinder, turned it around so that the baby was inside the church, and then rang a bell to alert caretakers. In 1984, developmental psychologist Aletha Solter published her book The Aware Baby about a parenting philosophy that advocates attachment, extended breastfeeding and abstinence from punishment, similarly to what William Sears later wrote; however, the point that Solter stressed most was an encouragement of the child's emotional expression in order to heal stress and trauma. In the 1990s, T. Berry Brazelton invigorated the discussion. He contributed new research about the capacity of newborn infants to express themselves and their emotions, sensitized parents for these signals, and encouraged them – just like Spock – to follow their own judgment.\n\nQuestion: In the late 60s Owen Finlay MacLaren pioneered what useful item for parents of small chldren?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The organisation grew from this protest, and demanded Objective One regional funding for Cornwall, an exclusively-Cornish European Parliament constituency, a Cornish university, support for Cornwall's traditional industries and local control over Cornwall's health service; these demands were broadly similar to those being made at the time by Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party that had recently relaunched itself. Cornish Solidarity was consolidated as a pressure group after the closure of South Crofty, the last hard rock mine in Cornwall, in March 1998. Naval constructor William Doughty, a frequent critic of the commandant, denounced Hull's regulations telling the men Hull must \"think them all rogues or thieves.\" The strongest group of holdouts remained the ship carpenters \n\n The Building Workers’ Charter was a workers' rights campaign launched in 1970 with branches in Glasgow, London, Manchester, Wigan, Leicester, Stoke and North Wales by 1971. They were active in the campaign to abolish the 'Lump Labour Scheme' and played a significant role in the 1972 National Strike. On July 8, 1980 a strike started in the WSK factory, which quickly spread to other factories in the Lublin region and brought the local economy to a standstill. However, the pressure for change generated by the strikes in turn led to the August strikes in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland's Baltic Sea Coast, which shortly after led to the emergence of the Solidarity movement.\n\nQuestion: In which city's shipyard was Solidarity set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following an Ali victory against the hard-hitting Earnie Shavers in September 1977, Pacheco performed a post-fight battery of reflex tests on Ali. After Ali didn't perform at a level that would be requisite for being able to protect himself in the ring, an alarmed Pacheco recommended that Ali retire immediately from boxing. When Ali refused, Pacheco decided that from a medical perspective, he couldn't ethically continue as Ali's primary physician and left the \n\n theme music, \"The Greatest\" (taken from Ali's 1977 biographical film), as his own signature tune, and borrowed the catchphrase \"bom-ba-ye\" from Ali's fans at the Rumble in the Jungle. Rhee considered the match and their participation as \"shameful\", and Pacheco would even deny to have taken part in the event until forty years later. Referee Lebell was the only person who remembered the match in a positive light, calling it a \"very interesting, and a great memory.

Christian Olsson moved into second with a 17.28m. In his breakthrough year of 1995, Edwards produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5 1⁄2 inches) at the European Cup.

Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and was appointed a CBE shortly thereafter. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the \"four majors\" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games and European Championships). On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier with a jump of 18.16 m (59 feet 7 inches).

Altobelli inherited a lineup led by first baseman Eddie Murray (.306 BA, 33 HR, 111 RBI), who finished second in the 1983 MVP voting, and shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr. (.318 BA, 27 HR, 102 RBI), who out-pointed Murray, 322–290, and won the 1983 MVP. The Orioles finished first in the AL in team home runs (168); first in OBP (.340); and second in runs, doubles, and walks. The minor league Orioles moved into Terrapin Park, a wooden ballpark. This move began a chain of events which would eventually lead to the return of major league baseball to Baltimore. After the demise of the Federal League and the Terrapins, Baltimore would not see major league baseball again until, when the former St. Louis Browns moved into town and became the present-day Baltimore Orioles. As the Terrapins' owners were not offered any part of the buyout offer \n\n Most of the professional baseball teams in Baltimore have been called the Orioles, in reference to the Baltimore oriole bird. There was already a minor league Baltimore Orioles, and the new Federal League club built their ballpark directly across the street from the Orioles park.

On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron's ultimate career total, 755, remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. At first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. On April 4, opening day of the next season, he hit No.714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of his money in the team. Seeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three home runs of his career.\n\nQuestion: For which team did Babe Ruth blast his last Major League home run?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Kennedy was born in New York City on January 11, 1965, the ninth child of the eleventh children of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy. Kennedy was baptized as a Catholic by William Jerome McCormack at St. Patrick's Cathedral in front of a crowd of 200 people. Kennedy was hospitalized in Bethesda, Maryland, at age 12 after he suffered an injury in an elevator accident at the Rockville home of his uncle and aunt, Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Described as \"wild in his youth,\" Kennedy was expelled from Phillips Academy. Kennedy graduated from Harvard College. In 1991, he married Victoria Anne Strauss, the granddaughter of Maurice \"Moe\" Strauss. Kennedy never declared his candidacy, citing his desire to spend time with his family, including his three children under the age of 10. Kennedy later moved to California.

The new curriculum was intended to disrupt what the two men considered to be an overly insular culture and rigidly formal training regimen at Juilliard, and effectively altered the course of American \n\n The New School is a private research university in New York City.

The revolutionaries, headed by Sun Yat-sen, were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang Qichao, who tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall, Sun Yat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race, and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors. Yuan Shikai abused his powers, overriding the constitution and creating strong tensions between himself and the other parties. These parties were united by Sun in 1919 under the title \"The Kuomintang of China\". At one point, two soldiers at Yongtai, apparently resenting Sun for his discipline, entered headquarters and wanted to assassinate Sun.

Thus, many old revolutionaries did not join Sun's new organization, and he was largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period.

While there in 1961, he was recruited to become a member of Fatah, founded by Yasser Arafat and five other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s. At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States. According to Abu Daoud, part of the funds raised by Abbas were used, without the latter's knowledge, to implement the 1972 Munich massacre. In the wake of the Declaration of Principles set forth in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords, Yassir Arafat's Fatah organized a rally among the predominantly Muslim community to gather their support for the agreements at Jenin Refugee Camp. It was followed by a passionate talk by a local shabiba (Fatah youth) promising that this was the first step towards reclaiming all of Mandatory Palestine, words that elicited a more enthusiastic \n\n Arab Palestine Organization (منظمة فلسطين العربية) is a former Palestinian political faction.

Spencer strongly disapproved of the match, but Compton's influence at court enabled him to procure Spencer's imprisonment in the Fleet Prison in March 1599 for ill-treating his daughter. The marriage quickly followed, but Spencer gave his daughter no marriage portion. But some reconciliation apparently took place soon afterwards, it is said, through the intervention of Elizabeth. She was the eldest daughter of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough, and his wife, the former Lady Caroline Russell. Largely denied access to personal relationships with men of their own rank, several of the daughters of George III embarked on such romances with gentlemen at court. As she wrote to her brother, the future King George IV, then Prince Regent, in 1812, the two had entered into an understanding around 1803, while Spencer was stationed in England. The couple conducted their romance with the utmost privacy, and Augusta asked the Prince Regent in 1812 to consent to her marrying Spencer, promising further discretion in their behaviour. It was Spencer who informed Augusta of her mother's death later that year, and Spencer was said to be holding a locket with Augusta's picture when he died in 1828.\n\nQuestion: In which country was Earl Spencer's acrimonious divorce settlement heard?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Al Tajir also owns London's Sheraton Park Tower Hotel at 101 Knightsbridge near Hyde Park and Mereworth Castle in Kent, which he purchased in 1976 for $1.2 million. In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner Hani Salaam. Al Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai's aluminum smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the Dubai World Trade Centre. In the judgement of a British court case, Al Tajir conspired to defraud Dubai Aluminium of millions of dollars in connivance with commodities trader Marc Rich, who owned a neighbouring property in Switzerland. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the Dubai World Trade Centre. Al Tajir's influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain's future profits at risk. In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai's Department of Economic Development. In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman. Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities. Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz's Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Al Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed's offer of a formal partnership. Al-Fayed earned £1.5 million commission from the contract for British engineering company\n\nQuestion: In which North African country was Mohammed Al-Fayed, owner of Harrods department store in London, born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

William Lees Judson was born in 1842 in Manchester, England, and moved to the United States with his parents when he was ten years old. After serving four years with the Illinois volunteers during the American Civil War, Judson studied art in New York and Paris.

Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer, and entertainer, caused a sensation at the Folies Bergère. In a new revue, La Folie du Jour, in which she danced the number \"Fatou\" wearing a costume revealing all but a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Wearing only her loincloth of bananas, Baker suggestively performed \"danse sauvage\" to a Charleston tempo – a genre still new to Europe. This dance inspired a 1929 tempera painting titled Josephine Baker, first shown by the painter Ivanhoe Gambini in an exhibition \n\n In the Paris of the 1920s, the theater was essentially dominated by four directors -- Louis Jouvet, Georges Pitoëff, Charles Dullin and Gaston Baty. However, they had much less success than Sacha Guitry in Théâtre des Variétés. Specifically, the theatrical performance was a great success with audiences and had an undeniable renewal in 1920, first at the stage performance. Dugravier lives with his daughter Reine, his niece Louise and his servants Julie and Bertrand. The latter is in love with Julie but she favours Jasmin, a valet in a nearby house, visiting the Dugravier home. The three young men then escape through a window, but return shortly after, claiming to have fought off the imaginary bandits. In Montfermeil, the duplicitous innkeepers, the Thénardiers, use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, Éponine.

The musical, with music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, was based on the stories of Sholem Aleichem. Before opening on Broadway, the play had been perfected during the summer in performances in Detroit and in Washington, D.C.. They hear the offstage voice of the Fiddler, and the Witch drags the Goose-Girl inside. Enter the Fiddler, followed by the Woodcutter and the Broom-maker, emissaries from the nearby town who have come to parley with the Witch.

In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railroad, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the chance to enforce its vision. Prior to 1845, the urban transport network consisted primarily of a large number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French \n\n  A number of cable railway systems which pull their cars on inclined slopes were built since the 1820s. In Istanbul, Turkey, the Tünel \n\n 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan. After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892. The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations.\n\nQuestion: Which was the first European city this century to open an underground railway system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During this time she reportedly attempted to finish many novels, before finally completing The Last Samurai, her 50th manuscript, in 1998. When Featherstone, as Lulu, informs everyone at the press conference that she has no plans to write a sequel, Dixon and Marlowe hatch \n\n full-time on writing, though she occasionally taught classes and led writing workshops. As Thayer, she wrote such books as Sandy and the Seventeen Balloons (1955), Quiet on Account of Dinosaur (1964), and Mr. Her last book for children, Clever Raccoon, came out in 1981. The Truro Public Library in her hometown, the seaside village of Truro, Massachusetts, honored her in 1996 by naming its children's room after her, and in 2004, the town of Truro declared her birthday, August 11, to be Catherine Woolley Day. Williams's fiction often portrays life as a downward spiral, addressing various forms of failure in America, from spiritual, ecological, and economic perspectives. Her characters, generally from the middle class, frequently fall from it, at times in bizarre fashion, in a form of cultural dispossession.

And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?\" The same as in Nietzsche, contempt for the fleeting interests of the moment, the same impulse for the eternal and for beauty: 'Do not give your love and faith to world politicians,' said Schlegel in the 1800s. For the same Schlegel, it was worth 'for the divine world of knowledge and art, to sacrifice the deepest feelings of your soul in the sacred, the fiery current of eternal perfection.'\" as food becomes our flesh, when it is changed into it, nor yet again as gold becomes a statue, by the addition to the material of gold of the accidental form of a statue, but after a similar manner to that in which soul and flesh being united become one man.\" [...] I found my key to this oeuvre in the theatrical text of Seneca. There Elektra asks Ägisth, the murderer of her father: What is worse than death? He replies: To live — if one desired to die.\" ...He can not become a human being without losing his divinity.

From 1939 to 1942, he was Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's personal aide and a deputy chief in the Reich Security Main Office under Heydrich who answered only to Himmler. party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy and over the home front. The committee members were Lammers (Chief of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. Hitler seemed to be in agreement with that proposal since none of them posed a threat to his leadership or would disagree with him. In 1932, he enlisted in the Luftwaffe, in which he served until 1936. He began to study law, but left this career path to join the Condor Legion, loyal to the forces of Francisco Franco in Spain, participating in the Spanish Civil War. At the start of the Second World War, he moved to Leipzig, where he joined the SiPo (Security Police) forces commanded by Karl Eberhard Schöngarth.

Kennedy took place at 12:30 p.m. (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, during a presidential motorcade in Dealey Plaza. Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife, Nellie when he was fatally shot by former U.S. Marine and American defector Lee Harvey Oswald from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Four sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (1865, by John Wilkes Booth), James A. Garfield (1881, by Charles J. Guiteau), William McKinley (1901, by Leon Czolgosz), and John F. Kennedy (1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald). The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. Oswald was arrested and charged by the Dallas Police Department for the assassination of Kennedy and for the murder of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit, who was shot dead in a residential neighborhood in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas just hours later. On Sunday, November 24, 1963, while being transferred from the city jail to the county jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of Dallas \n\nDecember 11, 1960: While vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida, President-elect John F. Kennedy was threatened by Richard Paul Pavlick, a 73-year-old former postal worker driven by hatred of Catholics. Pavlick intended to crash his dynamite-laden 1950 Buick into Kennedy's vehicle, but he changed his mind after seeing Kennedy's wife and daughter bid him goodbye. On January 27, 1961, Pavlick was committed to the United States Public Health Service mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri, then was indicted for threatening Kennedy's life seven weeks later. Charges against Pavlick were dropped on December 2, 1963, ten days after Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. On November 22, 1963, U.S. President John F.

When one of them, Katma Tui, says that Bruce is their hero, he gives her Sinestro's power ring before returning to Oa. In one instance he defended Terry to Commissioner Barbara Gordon when Shriek held Gotham hostage in exchange for Batman's life: In turn, Bruce initially treats Terry the same way he treated his wards Dick Grayson and Tim Drake.

The term \"ambulance\" at this time denoted a medical organisation that provided field hospitals, transport and surgical operations, not the more limited modern use.

The car came as a two-seater runabout for $800 or the $900 four-seater tonneau model with an option to add a top. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years' production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927).

The emblem of the African Union consists of a gold ribbon bearing small interlocking red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders. The flag was featured on the cantons of the flags of government agencies such the military, prisons service, and police. the flag was mistakenly put on posters in Ghana advertising that year's Africa Cup of Nations, sparking indignation among some South Africans. The flag was declared illegal for public display in South Africa in August 2019, when the Equality Court classified it as hate speech, with heavy enforcing penalties. Judge Phineas Mojapelo declared it to be \"Displaying [the apartheid flag] is destructive of our nascent non-racial democracy… it is an affront to the spirit and values of botho / ubuntu, which has become a mark of civilized interaction in post-apartheid South Africa\".

Researchers at the Institute of Archaeology of Samarkand date the city's founding to the 8th–7th centuries BCE. Archaeological excavations conducted within the city limits (Syob and midtown) as well as suburban areas (Hojamazgil, Sazag'on) unearthed 40,000-year-old evidence of human activity, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. The Syob and Darg'om canals, supplying the city and its suburbs with water, appeared around the 7th–5th centuries BCE (early Iron Age). A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has been described by Time as Syria's commercial capital. Author Diana Darke has written that \"The city has long been multi-cultural, a complex mix of Kurds, Iranians, Turkmen, Armenians and Circassians overlaid on an Arab base in which multi-denominational churches and mosques still share the space.\" At least two protesters had been shot dead by security forces \n\n During the Severan dynasty, a third century imperial dynasty of Rome from Syrian origins, the emperor Septimius Severus named with the title \"Metropolis\" the city in 194 AD and allowed the Ius Italicum (exemption from empire taxation) to Laodicea, that was later called a \"Roman Colonia\".

As king, Louis XVI focused primarily on religious freedom and foreign policy. While none doubted his intellectual ability to rule France, it was quite clear that, although raised as the Dauphin since 1765, he lacked firmness and decisiveness. Louis XVI's attempts to control it resulted in the Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), on 20 June, the declaration of the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and eventually to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which started the French Revolution.\n\nQuestion: Who was king of France at the time of the French Revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language). For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007.

It borders on the Northwestern Byala Slatina-Pleven and Vidin-Lom dialect and north, the Sofia dialect to the southeast and the Serbian Torlak dialect to the southwest.

The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. In the 21st century, after 58 years of non-religious use, the cathedral is once again the setting for regular liturgical celebrations in multiple languages—Russian, Polish, Korean, English, French, Spanish, Armenian and Latin—as well as benefit concerts featuring organ and church music. The cathedral is listed as a heritage building in the Russian Federation, and is a protected monument. The cathedral, built in a neo-Gothic style, is a cruciform pseudo-basilica with three naves and an apse. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II \n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911.

It is spoken in the Greater Helsinki region, and in urbanized areas in the Tavastian and Central Finland dialectal areas, such as the cities of Tampere, Jyväskylä, Lahti, Hyvinkää, and Hämeenlinna. The combination of the common spoken Finnish and a dialect gives a regional variant (aluepuhekieli), which has some local idiosyncrasies but is essentially similar to the common spoken Finnish. Finland is a predominantly Christian nation where 67.8% of the 5.5 million overall population are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (Protestant), 29.4% are unaffiliated, 1.1% are Orthodox Christians, 0.9% are other christians and 0.8% follow other religions like Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, folk religion etc. There are presently two National churches (as opposed to State churches): the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (Protestant), which is the primary religion representing 67.8% of the population by the end of 2020, and the Finnish Orthodox Church, to which about 1.1% of the population belongs. There are also approximately 45,000 followers of Pentecostal Christianity, and more than 12,000 Catholic Christians in Finland, along with Anglicans, and some various Independent Christian communities. Prior to its Christianisation, beginning in the 11th century, Finnish paganism was the country's primary religion. The Muslim population in Finland is 2.7% of the total, with about 150,000 adherents in 2016. Although Mikael Agricola had started written Finnish with Abckiria in the 1500s, and a Finnish translation of the Civil Code of 1734 was published in 1759 (Ruotzin waldacunnan laki), it had no official status as a legal publication since the official language of administration was Swedish.

It is also called the Crusade of the Faint-Hearted due to the number of participants who joined this crusade after having turned back from the First Crusade. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. Some of these people were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; Adela of Blois, wife of Stephen, Count of Blois, who had fled from the siege of Antioch in 1098, was so ashamed of her husband that she would not permit him to stay at home. The leaders of the crusade included John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem, Leopold of Austria, the Grand Masters of the Hospitallers, the Templars and the Teutonic Knights. In early November, the Crusaders launched a campaign for the Jordan River, forcing Al-Adil I, Sultan of Egypt, to withdraw without fighting; the crusaders then pillaged Beisan.

He was the President of the Committee of Jurists asked by the Council of the League of Nations in 1925 to provide an opinion on a dispute between Danzig and Poland. Van Eysinga was the Dutch government's representative at the 1930 League of Nations Codification Conference, which purported to codify certain aspects of international law. In 1930, van Eysinga was elected by the Assembly and Council of the League of Nations to serve on the Permanent Court of International Justice. He died in Leiden on 24 January 1961. The headquarters of the ICC is in Paris, France. The Palace of Justice forms part of the northern façade of Church Square in Pretoria. The building dates to the nineteenth century and was designed by the Dutch architect Sytze Wierda. The foundation stone was laid on June 8, 1897 by South African Republic (ZAR) President Paul Kruger. The most famous political trial in South Africa's history, the Rivonia Trial, took place here. The judiciary comprises eleven district courts, four courts of appeal, two administrative courts (Centrale Raad van Beroep and the College van beroep voor het bedrijfsleven) and a Supreme Court that has 41 judges. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest court of the Netherlands, Curacao, Sint Maarten and Aruba. The Court sits in The Hague, Netherlands and presides over civil, criminal and tax-related cases.\n\nQuestion: In which Netherlands city does the United Nations International Court of Justice sit?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Harold marched his army back down to the south coast, where he met William's army, at a place now called Battle just outside Hastings. Harold was killed when he fought and lost the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. Once the battle is over, the clouds disperse, disclosing the field of Hastings, the night after the battle. In the centre is a hillock on which lie the body of King Harold and others. He took to his bed and fell into a coma; at one point he woke and turned to Harold Godwinson and asked him to protect the Queen and the kingdom. Duke William approaches with his men, and Malet announces that Harold died 'as heroes die, upon the field'. His men respond enthusiastically, and the standard-bearer replaces Harold's standard with that of William, while the nuns and monks remain kneeled round Harold's body. They marched towards York, where they were confronted, at Fulford Gate, by the English forces that were under the command of the northern earls, Edwin and Morcar; the Battle of Fulford followed, on 20 September, which was one of the bloodiest battles of medieval times. The English forces were routed, though Edwin and Morcar escaped. The victors entered the city of York, exchanged hostages and were provisioned. Hearing the news whilst in London, Harold Godwinson force-marched a second English army to Tadcaster by the night of the 24th, and after catching Harald Hardrada by surprise, on the morning of 25 September, Harold achieved a total victory over the Scandinavian horde after a two-day-long engagement at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Harold gave quarter to the survivors allowing them to leave in 20 ships.\n\nQuestion: In which battle did Harold II, the last Saxon king, lose his life?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Party, still led by urban intellectuals, developed a radical agenda of mass mobilization, labor organization, rural uprisings, anti-imperialism, and national unification. As the Northern Expedition neared success, Chiang in December 1927 unleashed a White Terror that virtually wiped out the Party in the cities. Mao Zedong, whose Autumn Harvest Uprising had been a spectacular failure in mobilizing local peasants, never-the-less became Party leader and established rural bases and creation of the Chinese Red Army to protect them. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) Mao led a rectification campaign to emphasize Maoism and his leadership and after the war he led the Party to victory in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949).\n\nQuestion: Who proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Anne died giving birth to her only daughter by Thomas, Anne St. Leger (14 January 1476 – 21 April 1526), who due to the special remainder was  heiress to the estates of her mother's first husband Henry Holland.

Habsburg Castle (Schloss Habsburg) is a medieval fortress located in what is now Habsburg, Switzerland, in the canton of Aargau, near the Aar River. At the time of its construction, the location was part of the Duchy of Swabia. Habsburg Castle is the original seat of the House of Habsburg, which became one of the leading imperial and royal dynasties in Europe. The original coat of arms to fly over Habsburg Castle, a red lion on a golden field, remained part of the Austrian arms up to the end of the imperial period. The area around the castle was covered by forests that were only cleared around 1500, nearly half a millennium after Habsburg Castle was first constructed. After 1279 the village Geckingen was called Münchenstein. In March 1324, after the death of the last Graf on Pfirt, Ulrich III, the castle and the village of Münchenstein was inherited by the Herzog of Austria, as heiress Johanna von Pfirt (Jeanne de Ferrette) (1300–1351) was married to Herzog Albrecht II von Habsburg (1298–1358). After the war, Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III. ordered the demolition of the castle, possibly out of fear for it being an \"unconquerable fort of anti-Habsburg resistance\". Castle palaces, chapel and other parts of the bastion were used as a granary, devaluating the whole complex, yet protecting it from being rebuilt. The castle stayed in Czernin's hands until the nationalization in 1945. The castle was built around 1020 by Count Radbot, of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, and Werner, Bishop of Strasbourg. They had the castle erected 35 km southwest of Klettgau, on the Aar, the largest tributary of the High Rhine. The name of \"Habsburg\" was not added to the noble title until Radbot's grandson, Otto II. He added \"von Habsburg\" to his title, thus beginning the House of Habsburg. Habsburg Castle's importance diminished after Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph moved the family's power base to Austria in 1276.

Hills and fog obstructed the view, and the column marched straight into the bulk of the French armies. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim. For two days the French assaulted the stoutly defended Austrian position at Arcole without success. That day Davidovich routed Vaubois, but it was too late. Bonaparte's victory at Arcole permitted him to concentrate against Davidovich and chase him up the Adige valley. But without his colleague's support, the Austrian commander was too weak to continue the campaign and he withdrew again. Wurmser attempted a breakout, but his effort came too late in the campaign and had no effect on the result. While the Austrians prevaricated, Steinmetz decided at 8:30 am to send eight infantry \n\n The French suffered 1,000 killed and wounded, plus 800 men and two artillery pieces captured. Having failed to dislodge the Austrians, Bonaparte contemplated a retreat behind the Adda River and potentially abandoning the blockade of Mantua. But when the Austrians dawdled rather than taking advantage of their opportunities, the French commander determined to attack his opponent again. Stripping Vaubois and Kilmaine of every available man, Bonaparte fell upon Alvinczi at the Battle of Arcola on 15–17 November and defeated the Austrians.\n\nQuestion: Who were the victors of the Battle of Austerlitz?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 1970 until 2019, it was represented by Kenneth Clarke who was the Father of the House of Commons for the last two years. His political career is the fifth-longest in the modern era and he is a notable figure in British politics. It elects one Member of Parliament at least once every five years using the first-past-the-post system of voting. It is currently represented by David Linden of the Scottish National Party who has been the MP since 2017. It was once one of the safest seats for the Labour Party, the areas included in the constituency having returned solely Labour MPs since the 1930s. However, it achieved national prominence when a by-election in 2008 saw the Scottish National Party overturn a majority of over 13,000 votes to gain the seat.\n\nQuestion: In which parliament has the UK 87 seats for members who are elected for a five0-year term?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It then changed its name to the more descriptive Ecology Party in 1975, and to the Green Party ten years later. In 1991 Green Party spokesman and TV sports presenter David Icke created considerable embarrassment for the Party when he revealed his extreme political and spiritual beliefs. In 1991, attempts to streamline the Party Constitution were proposed by a group called Green 2000, who wanted to \"modernise\" the Party and make it into an organised electoral force that could become the ruling party in \n\n Council. The Green Party were the official opposition on Norwich City Council; they formed part of the ruling coalition that controlled Lancaster City Council alongside the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and shared control of Castle Morpeth Council as part of an all party administration. In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the House of Lords, the (unelected) upper chamber of Parliament: in the person of Lord Beaumont of Whitley, who died in 2008. According to MORI in 2010, Green issues were rated as importantly as during the Green Party's previous high point in the late 1980s. These internal constitutional wranglings, and negative public statements released by supporters of both Green 2000 and decentralists who ran the recall campaigns, seriously hampered preparations for the 1992 General Election, in which 253 Green candidates received 1.3% of the vote. The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, the recession of 1992–93 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of New Labour.\n\nQuestion: What was the former name of the British Green Party?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Apart from one-party-dominant and two-party systems, multi-party systems tend to be more common in parliamentary systems than presidential systems and far more common in countries that use proportional representation compared to countries that use first-past-the-post elections. First-past-the-post requires concentrated areas of support for large representation in the legislature, whereas proportional representation better reflects the range of a population's views. Proportional systems may have \n\n The random ballot, single stochastic vote, or lottery voting is an electoral system in which an election is decided on the basis of a single randomly selected ballot. It is closely related to random dictatorship;  the latter is a general rule for social choice, while random ballot is an application of this general rule for electing candidates in multi-constituency bodies. Whilst appearing superficially chaotic, the system has the potential to retain the most attractive characteristics of both first past the post and proportional representation systems in elections to multi-constituency bodies. Its application to elections was first described in 1984 by Akhil Reed Amar,. William Poundstone observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the spoiler effect—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority.\n\nQuestion: \"What is the more common name of the \"\"simple plurality\"\" system of voting?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bonapartism had its followers from 1815 onward among those who never accepted the defeat at Waterloo or the Congress of Vienna. The animus of the members of the Second Coalition was mostly against the French Revolution, its ideas and its consequences. Talleyrand and Napoleon therefore saw a possibility of a compromise, in which France would retain its chain of docile client states, but with the \"revolutionary\" sting removed, to appease the Allies. That unrevolutionary docility was to be assured by constitutions designed to eliminate not only domestic conflict (as was the new French political order), but also any flashes of impertinent nationalism. ...

He worked with lyricist Michel Vaucaire. In 1956 they wrote Non, je ne regrette rien, recorded in 1960 by Édith Piaf. That led to more than 30 songs for her, such as Flonflons du Bal, Mon Dieu and Les Amants which Piaf and Dumont wrote and sang together in 1962. Dumont tells in the book Édith Piaf, Opinions publiques, by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the popular French singer Rosalie Dubois.

When applied to lignite and some sub-bituminous coals, the Coldry process produces a feedstock in the form of densified pellets that significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared \n\n The chemical and calorific values of densified coal derived from typical Victorian brown coal with a natural average moisture content of 60 per cent by weight compares well with typical high grade black coal exported from Tarong Queensland, and Newcastle New South Wales Australia. To solve the problem of energy shortage after the deforestation in the area, Rhenanus experimented with brown coal beginning in 1563, which was discovered a few years earlier in the area of the nearby mountain \"Hoher Meissner\". The brown coal burned worse than the charcoal, whose technology was better known. Densified coal is the product of the Coldry Process coal upgrading technology that removes moisture from low-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite/brown coal. The densification process raises the calorific value of low-rank coal to equal or exceed that of many export-grade black coals. Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal. A relatively high altitude formation, Maddingley brown coal is distinguished as having 60 per cent moisture content and a rich fulvic acid and humic acid content.\n\nQuestion: What type of coal is brown and fibrous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Normally glass consists of 70% to 74% silica, 16% to 22% alkali and 5% to 10% of flux. The other components and mineral compounds from glass can leach out over time, causing iridescent rainbow patterns and flaking of the outer surface of glass\n\n which the core material was scraped out. Much of early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt.

In seagrasses, this polymer has also been detected, but often in lower amounts compared to angiosperm land plants. Thus, the cell walls of seagrasses seem to contain combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae together with new structural elements. Seagrass cell walls contain the same polysaccharides found in angiosperm land plants, such as cellulose However, the cell walls of some seagrasses are characterised by sulfated polysaccharides, which is a common attribute of macroalgae from the groups of red, brown and also green algae. Another unique feature of cell walls of seagrasses is the occurrence of unusual pectic polysaccharides called apiogalacturonans.

The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may \n\n support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's third law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced. To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:  Forces F1 and F2 are equal due of Newton's third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4. One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton's third law to pairs of 'equal and opposite' forces acting on the same object. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton's second law. They are therefore 'equal and opposite', yet they are acting \n\n of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground.\n\nQuestion: What is the force that opposes the relative motion of two bodies that are in contact?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. In land plants, leaves absorb mostly red and blue light in the first layer of photosynthetic cells because of Chlorophyll absorbance. Green light, however, penetrates deeper into the leaf interior and can drive photosynthesis more efficiently than red light. Because green and yellow wavelengths can transmit through chlorophyll and the entire leaf itself, they play a crucial role in growth beneath the plant canopy. One of the requirements for productive farmland is adequate PAR, so PAR is used \n\n Cyanobacteria, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that obtain energy via photosynthesis. The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, \"blue-green algae\",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light. Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in \n\n increased cytosine methylation. In this case, relatively little new carotenoid is produced—the change in plastid pigments associated with leaf senescence \n\n A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast. When abundant in the leaf's cells, as during the growing season, the chlorophyll's green color dominates and masks out the colors of any other pigments that may be present in the leaf. Chlorophyll has a vital function: it captures solar rays and uses the resulting energy in the manufacture of the plant's food – simple sugars which are produced from water and carbon dioxide.\n\nQuestion: What is the green pigment used by plants to trap sunlight?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was one of the texts, along with Thomas Bewick's contemporaneous A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The first edition was admired by biologists including Charles Darwin and David Lack. George Montagu's introduction, \"in hopes of advancing knowledge of the subject\", mentions Thomas Pennant as being \"diffuse on the subject\" of ornithology, as well as Dr. Latham's General Synopsis of Birds and his Index Ornithologicus. He then introduces the anatomy of birds, separating those with a cartilaginous stomach or gizzard, and those with a membranous stomach; those that incubate their young, and the cuckoo that does not; with remarks on instincts such as carrying shell fragments away from the nest, birdsong, and feet adapted for different purposes, such as climbing or swimming. His work on the classification of birds based on anatomical and morphological characters was influential and made use of by Alexander Wetmore in his classification of North American birds. After graduation he travelled to the Natural History Museum in London in 1880 at the request of Albert Günther, to work on the museum's Catalogue of Birds. W. H. Mullens, in a 1908 issue of British Birds, argued that despite the contributions of Thomas Pennant, of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne (1789), and Thomas Bewick's fine wood engravings in A History of British Birds (1797–1804), ornithology had not made much progress since the seventeenth century. Instead, \"it was not until the genius of George Montagu produced in 1802 the 'Ornithological Dictionary' that the work which had been begun by Willughby and Ray [with their Ornithologia libri tres], was properly continued.\"\n\nQuestion: What id the name given to the study of birds?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Global production of farmed aquatic plants, overwhelmingly dominated by seaweeds, grew in output volume from 13.5 million tonnes in 1995 to just over 30 million tonnes in 2016. Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed.

Vertebrate MRF family members include MyoD1, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (Myf6). In non-vertebrate animals, a single MyoD protein is typically found. Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene.

It is comparable to the cytoplasm of other cells, but it contains unusually large amounts of glycogen (a polymer of glucose), myoglobin, a red-colored protein necessary for binding oxygen molecules that diffuse into muscle fibers, and mitochondria.

The most important is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules.

They are vital to agriculture and are important to almost all species of plants many species co-evolving with the fungi. \"Mycelium\", like \"fungus\", can be considered a mass noun, a word that can be either singular or plural. Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Unlike plant cells, animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches, fiber, oligosaccharides, and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins.

The field also differs from the field of animal communication in that it also interprets signs that are not communicative in the traditional sense, such as camouflage, mimicry, courtship behavior etc. Studies of this variety are becoming increasingly important in the field. Behavioural studies interrelate functional and eco-morphology. Behavioural studies are particularly common in fisheries and in studying birds.

Ringtail possums build nests from tree branches and occasionally use tree hollows. A communal nest is made up of an adult female and an adult male, their dependant offspring and immature offspring of the previous year. A group of ringtail possums may build several dreys at different sites. Ringtail possums are territorial and will drive away any strange conspecifics from their nests. Dreys contribute to the survival of the young when they are no longer carried on their mother's back. Mice are good jumpers, climbers, and swimmers, and are generally considered to be thigmotactic, i.e. A group of Squirrels is called a Drey which is run locally by a Scout Group. Squirrels make a simple promise, wear neckerchiefs, receive award badges, have short early evening meetings and are taught moral lessons through indirect means. After reaching the age of six, a Squirrel can move on to Beavers.\n\nQuestion: Which rodent rears its young, called kittens, in a nest called a drey?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The secondary veins branch once near the leaflet margin and may either enter a tooth or sinus, or branch again before entering a tooth or sinus. On occasion a vein branch may form a loop upwards and joint to the next secondary vein apically. Two separate systems of returning blood from the myocardial mass to the cardiac cavities. The major system consists of the coronary sinus, a wide vessel that collects blood from smaller veins and drains it to the right atrium. The smaller system consists of smaller veins that are draining the inner part of cardiac mass directly to cardiac cavities, most commonly to right atrium. There are three distinct lymphatic drainage plexuses in the heart, after anastomosing each other, they end up in a brachiocephalic node. This central scar marks where the main vascular bundle of the leaf connected to the vascular system of the stem. This xylem bundle was composed only of primary trachea.

They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. Not only do they consume the small mammals, but they also feed on their caches, as has been recorded in grizzly bears attacking voles and northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides). In some areas, caches may be the primary target when bears dig at these animal's burrows, as may be the case with Siberian chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus), whose hoards can contain up to 20 kg of food, with the chipmunks themselves only being caught occasionally. With particular regularity, tundra-dwelling grizzlies will wait at burrows of \n\n component. The spring diet of the blue grouse features Douglas-fir needles prominently.

There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons). The name seagrass stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow by rhizome extension and often spread across large \"meadows\" resembling grassland; many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae. Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. Aquaculture (less commonly spelled aquiculture ), also known as aquafarming, is the controlled cultivation (\"farming\") of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae and other organisms of value such as aquatic plants (e.g. Mariculture, commonly known as marine farming, refers specifically to aquaculture practiced in seawater habitats, opposed to in freshwater aquaculture. Phytoplankton are the autotrophic (self-feeding) components of the plankton community and a key part of ocean and freshwater ecosystems. The name comes from the Greek words φυτόν (phyton), meaning 'plant', and πλαγκτός (planktos), meaning 'wanderer' or 'drifter'. Phytoplankton obtain their energy through photosynthesis, as do trees and other plants on land. This means phytoplankton must have light from the sun, so they live in the well-lit surface layers (euphotic zone) of oceans and lakes. In comparison with terrestrial plants, phytoplankton are distributed over a larger surface area, are exposed to less seasonal variation and have markedly faster turnover rates than trees (days versus decades).\n\nQuestion: What is the generic word for plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken. In the generalized form, all teeth are involved. In the localized form, only a few teeth are involved. The most common teeth affected are the upper lateral incisors and third molars. Teeth affected by microdontia may also have abnormal shape, and the abnormal size may affect the whole tooth, or only a part of the tooth. Favorable eruption position of the second permanent molar may result if the first permanent molar is extracted when the child is at the age of between 8–10 years old. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors.

When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. They found that there were changes \n\n Dulaglutide binds to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, slowing gastric emptying and increases insulin secretion by pancreatic Beta cells. Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. GLP-1 is normally secreted by L cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to a meal. The formation of the pancreas from endoderm begins in early development. The expression of elements of the Notch signaling pathway have been found in the developing pancreas, suggesting that Notch signaling is important in pancreatic development. Here, it could explain the dispersed distribution of endocrine cells within pancreatic epithelium. A second mechanism is \"suppressive maintenance\", which explains the role of Notch signaling in pancreas differentiation. Much like the cardiac pacemaker, the pancreas is connected to cranial nerve 10, and others, but the oscillations are accomplished by intrapancreatic neurons and do not require \n\n The insulin concentration in blood increases after meals and gradually returns to basal levels during the next 1–2 hours. However, the basal insulin level is not stable. Such downregulation underlies insulin resistance, which is common in type 2 diabetes. It would therefore be advantageous to administer insulin to diabetic patients in a manner mimicking the natural oscillations. The insulin oscillations are generated by pulsatile release of the hormone from the pancreas. Since each islet contains up to 2000 beta cells and there are one million islets in the pancreas it is apparent that pulsatile secretion requires sophisticated synchronization both within and among the islets of Langerhans.\n\nQuestion: What is secreted by the pancreas to regulate blood sugar levels?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The atrioventricular groove hosts major coronary arteries while they travel along to the line of attachment of atrioventricular valves. The right and left ventricles are separated by a septum, which corresponds to the interventricular grooves that travel from the [[posterior to the anterior surface of the heart. The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. The heart has the shape of a pyramid, with its apex pointing towards the left nipple while its base forms the posterior surface of the heart. Four valves are usually present in a mammalian heart and together they determine the pathway of blood flow through the heart. The four valves in the mammalian heart are two atrioventricular valves separating the upper atria from the lower ventricles – the mitral valve in the left heart, and the tricuspid valve in the right heart. The other two valves are at the entrance to the arteries leaving the heart these are the semilunar valves – the aortic valve at the aorta, and the pulmonary valve at the pulmonary artery.

Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Because the major muscles of the thigh are the largest muscles of the body, resistance exercises (strength training) of them stimulate blood flow more than any other localized activity. In quadrupeds, the hamstring is the single large tendon found behind the knee or comparable area. These terms are often used after the particular muscle such as gluteus maximus, and gluteus minimus. The sartorius muscle is the longest muscle in the human body. It is a long, thin, superficial muscle that runs down the length of the thigh in the anterior compartment.

A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called ovulation. Until the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of meiosis I. From the whole pool of follicles a woman is born with, only 0.1% of them will rise ovulation, whereas 99.9% will break down (in a process called follicular atresia). From birth, the ovaries of the human female contain a number of immature, primordial follicles. These follicles each contain a similarly immature primary oocyte. At puberty, clutches of follicles begin folliculogenesis, entering a growth pattern that ends in ovulation (the process where the oocyte leaves the follicle) or in atresia (death of the follicle's granulosa cells). The follicles then transition to tertiary, or antral, follicles. At this stage in development, they become dependent on hormones, particularly FSH which causes a substantial increase in their growth rate. sperm enters the follicle and fertilizes the egg, giving rise to an intrafollicular pregnancy. In very rare occasions the pregnancy may find a sufficient foothold outside the ovary to continue as an abdominal pregnancy, and an occasional delivery has been reported. When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes where fertilization usually takes place. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of the zygote comes entirely from the egg cell.\n\nQuestion: When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. cells can become pacemakers. It is important to realize that these cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than the primary or secondary pacemaker cells. These disorganized waves conduct intermittently through the atrioventricular node, leading to irregular activation of the ventricles that generate the heartbeat. If the SA node does not function properly and is unable to control the heart rate, a group of cells further down the heart will become the ectopic pacemaker of the heart. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40-60 beats per minute, and are called the secondary pacemaker.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. ; Ovarian contribution of peripheral T, A and DHEA-S reaches maximum levels at mid-cycle, whereas ovarian contribution to peripheral DHT and DHEA does not seem to be influenced by the menstrual cycle. ; Ovary and adrenal cortex contribute equally to peripheral T, DHT and A, with the exception that at mid-cycle ovarian contribution of peripheral A is twice that of the adrenal. The ovaries and adrenal glands also produce androgens, but at much lower levels than the testes. Regarding the relative contributions of ovaries and adrenal glands to female androgen levels, in a study with six menstruating women the following observations have been made:\n\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted by the hypothalamus ; two gonadotropins: ; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ; luteinizing hormone (LH) ; estrogen ; progesterone As with most things related to the reproductive system, folliculogenesis is controlled by the endocrine system. They are: GnRH stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland that will later have a stimulatory effect on follicle growth (not immediately, however, because only antral follicles are dependent on FSH and LH).\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Limestone – By burning this mineral, lime is procured \n\n  Alabaster is a mineral or rock that is soft, often used for carving, and is processed for plaster powder. Geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type. Chemically, gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium, while calcite is a carbonate of calcium. They are usually lightly colored, translucent, and soft stones. Sorel cement (also known as magnesia cement or magnesium oxychloride) is a non-hydraulic cement first produced by the French chemist Stanislas Sorel in 1867. In fact, in 1855, before working with magnesium compounds, Stanislas Sorel first developed a two-component cement by mixing zinc oxide powder with a solution of zinc chloride. Only a decade later, Sorel replaced zinc with magnesium in his formula and also obtained a cement with similar favorable properties. The material could be easily molded like plaster when freshly prepared, or machined on a lathe after setting and hardening. It was very hard, could be easily bound to many different types of materials (good adhesive \n\n for mineral substrates such as mineral plasters and concrete.

If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. According to the cosmological principle, the random distribution of matter and energy within the different parts of the universe must be approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and that random overdensities of these objects must be small if projected on a large enough scale. Given also its proximity to the Huge-LQG, CCLQG and U1.54, it will be a big contradiction to the modern cosmological model. The premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the physical constants would make the universe radically different. The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life.\" This is an idea where a large amount of universes are located in \"the Landscape\"; he expands by communicating that each universe has different physics laws that govern each of them, as can be seen in the quote above. The anthropic principle is also present in the idea. He claims, for example, that we are only here because our universe has the precise set of laws of physics that it has, and that very few universes have the laws of physics needed for intelligent life.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the theory that the universe appears the same wherever and whenever viewed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 76 known moons \n\n the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus, which emits jets of gas and dust from its south-polar region, and Iapetus, with its contrasting black and white hemispheres. All of these moons are thought to have been captured asteroidal or perhaps comet bodies, possibly fragmented into several pieces. Two more were discovered in 2016 by the team led by Scott S.

It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. The galactic year, also known as a cosmic year, is the duration of time required for the Sun to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 230 km/s (828,000 km/h) or 143 mi/s (514,000 mph) within its trajectory around the galactic center, a speed at which an object could circumnavigate the Earth's equator in 2 minutes and 54 seconds; that speed corresponds to approximately 1/1300 of the speed of light. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies. It is located near the border of the constellations Sagittarius and Scorpius, about 5.6° south of the ecliptic, visually close to the Butterfly Cluster (M6) and Shaula. Observations of several stars orbiting Sagittarius A*, particularly star S2, have been used to determine the mass and upper limits on the radius of the object. Based on mass and increasingly precise radius limits, astronomers have concluded that Sagittarius A* is the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole.\n\nQuestion: What is the Milky Way?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

All three types are harmful to artifacts and the damage caused by all light is cumulative and irreversible. Exposure to light in all forms causes a chemical reaction to happen within the molecular level of an artifact. Therefore, thangkas are chemically and physically altered when exposed to light.

Other colors occur naturally in clouds. In the visible spectrum, blue and green are at the short end of light's visible wavelengths, while red and yellow are at the long end. The bluish color is evidence that such scattering is being produced by rain-sized droplets in \n\n any light reflected from water drops, at all. For colors seen by a normal human eye, the most commonly cited and remembered sequence, in English, is Isaac Newton's sevenfold red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet (popularly memorized by mnemonics like Roy G. Biv). The physical dimensions of colour include wavelength, intensity and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include hue, brightness and saturation.

This is a list of sovereign states and dependent territories in South America. South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean. South America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of Earth's surface. South America ranks fourth among all continents in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America).

There is a suggestion that citrus fruits produced in organic farming contain higher levels of malonic acid than fruits produced in conventional agriculture. Malonic acid was first prepared in 1858 by the French chemist Victor Dessaignes via the oxidation of malic acid. The juice contains a high quantity of citric acid and other organic acids giving them their characteristic sharp flavour. The genus is commercially important as many species are cultivated for their fruit, which is eaten fresh, pressed for juice, or preserved in marmalades and pickles. As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases.

Members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs, while those with warty skins are known as toads. Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the \"true toads\". Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live \n\n buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Most lay eggs in paired strings that hatch into tadpoles, although, in the genus Nectophrynoides, the eggs hatch directly into miniature toads. All true toads are toothless and generally warty in appearance. Different animals contain significantly different \n\n A true toad is any member of the family Bufonidae, in the order Anura (frogs and toads).

Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games. Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. For example, if the dice show a 2 and a 3 you may cover one of 2, 3, or 5. ; Digital – A player's score \n\n Domino games are similar in many respects to card games, but the generic device is instead a set of tiles called dominoes, which traditionally each have two ends, each with a given number of dots, or \"pips\", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears on a tile is unique in the set. The games played with dominoes largely center around playing a domino from the player's \"hand\" onto the matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's hand onto the board.

It both works as an assisting unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, and is responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. It is subordinate to the National Police Directorate. Instead, the National Police Foundation conducts and translates scientific research, training, technical assistance and evaluation to advance policing. It maintains a small plainclothes corps who investigates local crimes; these are organised into Criminal Brigades. The DCSP also deploys 9 Groupes d'Intervention de la Police Nationale (GIPN), intervention units similar to the Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion (RAID) team (which is directly under orders of the Direction Générale de la Police Nationale). The policing of transnational and international crimes is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention \"tantamount to abduction\" when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare (\"extradite or prosecute\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \"internationally protected persons\".\n\nQuestion: What is the acronym for the agency which provides co-operation between police forces worldwide?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Håkansson wore a bikini during the crowning ritual, after which she was condemned by the Pope, and some countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced with more modest swimwear. While bikinis were eventually reintroduced to Miss World, Håkansson remains the only winner to have received her crown while wearing a bikini. Organisers extended an offer to first runner-up Evangeline Pascual of the Philippines to complete the duties of Miss World for the remainder of the year, but without holding the title; when Pascual turned down that offer, organisers next turned to second runner-up Patsy Yuen of Jamaica, who accepted.

They may also experience poor speech, pain and dissatisfaction with the appearance, lowering their quality of life. A retrograde character ; A primitive pattern ; Mendelian recessive character ; Atavistic feature ; A mutation Taurodontism is a condition found in the molar teeth of humans whereby the body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged vertically at the expense of the roots. Taurodontism is most commonly found in permanent dentition although the term is traditionally applied to molar teeth. Moreover, pre-existing plaque-induced periodontitis can also cause occlusal trauma to increase the rate of connective tissue loss, which in turn may increase tooth mobility. By far the most common cause is periodontal disease (gum disease). This is painless, slowly progressing loss of bony support around teeth. It is made worse by smoking and the treatment is by improving the oral hygiene above and below the gumline. ; Dental abscesses can cause resorption of bone and consequent loss of attachment. ; Many other conditions can cause permanent or temporary loss of attachment and increased tooth mobility. Although it cannot cause periodontium damage in itself, bruxism is known to be able to worsen attachment loss and tooth mobility if periodontal disease is already present.\n\nQuestion: Taphephobia is the fear of losing your teeth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at age 24. On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful \n\n , born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite.

The first fully phonemic script, the Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, is considered to be the first alphabet, and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and possibly Brahmic.

This is likely due to the 1981 NCAA Television Briefing Book, which said\"College football television had begun in 1938, when one of the University of Pennsylvania's games was beamed from Franklin Field to the Philco offices-laboratories, also in Philadelphia. As far as is known, there were six television sets in Philadelphia; and all were tuned to the game.\" However, this game occurred before the 1939 New York World's Fair, which marked the beginning of regularly scheduled television broadcasts. This, along with the fact that the game was broadcast to the Philco laboratories, likely means the game was used as a field test. The broadcast established what was then the longest continuous coverage of a sporting event in American television history. On September7, 1979, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 30,000 viewers tuned in to witness the launch of ESPN. Simultaneously, ESPN debuted its first SportsCenter telecast with anchors Lee Leonard and George Grande. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. The game came just one month after the Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the first-ever televised professional baseball game, and five months after the Princeton and Columbia baseball teams played the first televised sporting event. On February 28, 1940, the University of Pittsburgh played Fordham at Madison Square Garden in the first televised basketball game.\n\nQuestion: In 1931, what became the first ever televised sports event?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones. After C comes the key of G (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A). These may be prefixed by ♯,  ♭, or  ♮, and suffixed by  dot (length × 1½). The note is preceded by its octave, which is written as the number plus an upper dot:  5th 8va,  2nd 8va, etc. The sign signals a change in octave. In musical notation, this is represented by an \"X\" for a note head instead of an oval, or parentheses around the note head.

These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"Chakalaka\", \"Currywurst\", \"Pommes\" (french fries), \"Rot-weiss\" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). The origin of the dish and its name is disputed. One claim is that it was created from a mistake made by a fourteen-year-old assistant waiter Henri Charpentier in 1895 at the Maitre at Monte Carlo's Café de Paris. I \n\n In Austria and Germany, deep-fried spring rolls are called Frühlingsrolle, while the Vietnamese salad rolls are called Sommerrolle (\"summer roll\"). The French call them nem for the fried ones, and rouleaux de printemps for the others, whereas in Poland they are known as sajgonki, named after Saigon, the city from which many of the Vietnamese immigrants in Poland originated. The fried sweet potatoes tradition dates to the early nineteenth century in the United States. Sweet potato fries or chips are a common preparation, and are made by julienning and deep frying sweet potatoes, in the fashion of French fried potatoes. Roasting sliced or chopped sweet potatoes lightly coated in animal or vegetable oil at high heat became common in the United States at the start of the 21st century, a dish called “sweet potato fries”. The French had refused to endorse the US invasion of Iraq, which happened without UN's approval, triggering an intense wave of anti-French sentiment, which culminated in the call to rebrand French fries, \"freedom fries.\"\n\nQuestion: From which country do French fries originate?

Scared, she hears footsteps approaching the bedroom and hides under the blanket. From under the blanket, the woman looks towards the power strip it is plugged in to. The flickering stops. The hallway light clicks back on and she sees it is on again and the door is only slightly ajar again. She is relieved, but unfortunately suddenly sees a monstrous humanoid with all-white eyes and an open mouth at her bedside table. It turns off the lamp, and the screen goes dark. While she is semi-conscious, they drag her into the basement den and into the unsealed fireplace. However, when Rusty (who was talking the whole time) gets back into the living room, three hours have passed. But when Lisa gets her pillow, the living room doors slam shut and lock. On a dark and rainy night, a woman (Lotta Losten) comes out of a room and turns off the hallway light, which causes a long-haired, humanlike silhouette to become visible at the other end of the hallway. Surprised, the woman turns the light back on and the silhouette vanishes. Switching the light off and on, she watches the silhouette appear and disappear, stopping when the silhouette suddenly moves so close it is inches away from her face. Gasping, she turns the light back on and tapes the switch in that position to prevent the silhouette from returning. The woman goes to bed, leaving the lamp on her bedside table on and the door leading to the lit hallway ajar. She hears creaking sounds and looks towards the\n\nQuestion: Mary has a large bedroom and the only light switch is on the wall approximately 20 feet away from her bed.

It has been cited as the longest word in the English language (excluding coined and technical terms), although some dictionaries do not recognize it because of its low usage in everyday lexicon. The longest word found in a major dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, but this is a technical term that was coined specifically to be the longest word. The word became known in the public realm in the United States via a popular television show in the 1950s, The $64,000 Question, when a young contestant correctly spelled it to win. The only \"word processing\" these mechanical systems could perform was to change where letters appeared on the page, to fill in spaces that were previously left on the page, or to skip over lines. The concept ultimately came to be called a \"type-writer\" in 1874. In contrast, Personal Shorthand uses only the 26 letters of the alphabet, without any special symbols, positioning, or punctuation, and it can therefore be written cursively, printed, typed, or even entered in a computer without special typefaces or graphics. Given years of practice, symbol shorthand writers could sometimes acquire skills of 150 or even 200 words per minute, which might have qualified them for demanding positions such as court reporting, typically dominated today by machine shorthands. Most symbol shorthand writers in secretarial positions wrote between 80 and 140\n\nQuestion: What is the longest word can be typed using only the top row of letters on a typewriter?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An arrangement often found in high rise public housing blocks, particularly those built in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s, is that elevators would only call at half the total number of floors, or at an intermediate level between a pair of floors; for example a lift of a 24-storey building would only stop at 12 levels, with staircases used to access the \"upper\" or \"lower\" level from each intermediate landing. Where the \n\n traffic necessitates a second lift the alternate floors strategy is sometimes still applied, not only for the doorway reduction but also, provisionally upon the passengers preferring no particular floor beyond capacity, it tends toward halving the total delay imposed by the stops en-route. Sometimes, two elevators are divided so that all floors are served, but one elevator only serves odd floors and the other even, which would often be less efficient for passengers, but cheaper to install because the group control of elevators was more complex than single control. A few buildings in the United States and Canada have both a \"first floor\" (usually the main floor \n\n brings her into his home. ; The elevators are divided into lower and upper tiers. In order to reach floors above 40, visitors must take an elevator to the \"sky lobby\" on 40 and transfer to a second elevator to continue upward. Also, to reach floor 62 or \"The Tip\", one must transfer to a private elevator at floor 61 using an encoded badge. As he sits by the elevator, a pair of guys call him out, with one calling him a fag.\n\nQuestion: A man lives on the 20th floor of a block of flats. If it is a rainy day, he gets into the elevator in the morning, goes down to the ground floor and goes off to work. In the afternoon when he comes home, he gets into the elevator and goes straight to the 20th floor.

In 1779, the Siamese withdrew from the kingdoms of Vientiane and Champasak, leaving them under temporary military rule, while the kingdom of Luang Prabang accepted Siamese suzerainty. King Rama I adopted the Phra Kaew image as the palladium of his new city and dynasty. However, Yasukichi Yatabe, Japanese minister to Siam, criticized the King's way and that it would not be accomplished in a hundred years' time. This created a crisis for Siam since most of its foreign exchange was held in sterling. The Minister of Finance kept Siam on the gold standard by linking the currency to the US dollar, but debate about this policy raged within the government into 1932. One impact of this policy was that Siam's rice exports became more expensive than competitor \n\n In 1760, Burma began a series of wars with Siam that would last well into the middle of the 19th century.

The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee. The femur is categorised as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis, the shaft (or body) and two epiphysis or extremities that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee. Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), as well as in the fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). The sciatic nerve, also called the ischiadic nerve, is a large nerve in humans and other vertebrate animals which is the largest branch of the sacral plexus and runs alongside the hip joint and down the lower limb. The sciatic nerve has no cutaneous branches for the thigh. In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.\n\nQuestion: More commonly known as the thigh bone, what is the medical name for the longest bone in the human body?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For instance, a right-handed pitcher who is weak against left-handed hitting and is facing a left-handed hitter would be replaced with a pitcher, usually left-handed, who does a superior job of getting a left-handed hitter out. In such a situation, the manager will often call for his left-handed specialist. Some variations of the left hand are almost exclusively played on the upper left manual, entirely avoiding the bottom left one. In the left hand, consecutive octaves and fifths are common, whereas thirds of chords are generally avoided, and chords entirely within the left hand are not played on most typical instruments, because only a single digit, the thumb, is used. The defensive manager, however, may consider this an acceptable tradeoff versus facing the original left-handed batter with his right-handed pitcher. Most starters, especially those who rely on ball movement rather than power, are still stronger throwing against one side of the plate, however, the difference is often less pronounced\n\nQuestion: What word is used to describe someone who is neither left or right handed, but can use both hands with equal ease?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cross, who was a journalist, based the story on the real lives of juvenile delinquents he encountered in his work. It subsequently became a best-seller in the UK (and as an e-book in the United States), and was optioned for sitcom development by CBS. After receiving criticism for the story being \"offensive\" and appropriating the grief of losing a child, Card put a disclaimer at the end of the short story and his novel was written in the third-person. The novel received praise for its \"easy and natural prose\" and its genuine and uplifting themes. The novel won the 1992 Association of Mormon Letters Award for Best Novel. Lost Boys (1992) is a horror novel by American author Orson Scott Card. Dealing with themes such as religion and the nature of good and evil, the novel is an expansion of Card's short story \"Lost Boys\".

Ingram stated his songs had become \"bigger and more epic, more Broadway and more cinematic over time\", and Hasbro blessed the effort to try \"something groundbreaking for daytime television\". A large musical number in \"The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000\" paid homage to the song \"Ya Got Trouble\" from The Music Man. & Dave had previously been offered the chance to record the theme song for another BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, but turned it down as they were in Australia at the time due to the success of \"Ain't No Pleasing You\".

The show's composer Daniel Ingram created seven songs with episode's writer, M.A. The song played over the end credits is \"My Rifle, My Pony and Me\" by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, from the 1959 Western Rio Bravo. Tony is seen watching this movie (and specifically, the scene in which the song appears) in the Season Four premiere, \"For All Debts Public and Private\". ; The song playing in the Crazy Horse club when Adrianna walks in on Tony and Ralph in her office is \"Can't Stand It\" by The Greenhornes.\n\nQuestion: The theme tune to which TV show starts with the line Stick a pony in me pocket?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Unintentional interference results in a \"let\"&mdash;the point is replayed. Instead a \"chase\" is called where the ball made its second bounce and the server gets the chance, later in the game, to \"play off\" the chase from the receiving end; but to win the point being played off, their shot's second bounce must be further from the net (closer to the back wall) than the shot they originally failed to reach. \"laying\" a \"chase\", which ensures a change of end). This is in stark contrast to lawn tennis, where players alternately serve and receive entire games. In real tennis the service can only change during a game, and it is not uncommon to see a player serve for several consecutive games till a chase be made. Originally only the server could score; if he lost the rally he would lose the right to serve. Current rules give the point and the serve to the winner of a rally. A match is best three out of five games. When a player leads a match with more points than there are points left for the opponent to obtain, the match is over. If the score is tied after all four sports, a \"gummiarm\"-point is played.

Haggis is a high-level reference programming language used primarily to examine computing science for Scottish pupils taking SQA courses on the subject. Haggis is not based on any one language but a mixture that is intended to allow a pupil familiar with any of the many languages used in classrooms to easily understand the syntactic construct being used in an example. Online Haggis interpreters have been developed to provide a way for examiners and teachers to check their programs are correctly defined and behave as expected. Haggis is the solution to this. Haggis is a formally-defined reference language, but its purpose is to examine programming, not to write programs. So, while Haggis is in fact a programming language (even although, in general, not all Haggis programs are executable), it is not intended as a language in which to write programs.

Working as a physicist and chemist, she conducted pioneering research on radioactive decay and was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics and became the first person to receive a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Marie Skłodowska-Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel prize in 1903 (physics), went on to become a double Nobel prize winner in 1911, both for her work on radiation. In 1933, Rona and Karlik won the Austrian Academy of Sciences Haitinger Prize. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but she was able to return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen \n\n fractional crystallization process.

For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles. At the lowest extreme, an allele can be a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent \n\nNeutrophil: Neutrophils are the most common white blood cells in normal adult blood.

Each fireworks case, which contained 1,440 individual fireworks, was sold for $160, with Bramblett, who was responsible for selling the fireworks, and John Franklin Miller, an Ohio fireworks manufacturer who was the primary supplier of materials and was responsible for soliciting customers, each receiving $10.

The explosion was planned to coincide with the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605, but the man left in charge of the gunpowder stored beneath the House of Lords, Guy Fawkes, was discovered there and arrested. Around midnight on 4 November, Guy Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords, \n\n admitted to the plot, 25 March 1605, the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near. It was into this room that 36 barrels of gunpowder were brought, but when in late August Thomas and Fawkes made an inspection of the gunpowder, they found that it had decayed (separated). Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. Fawkes had posed as a servant of fellow plotter Thomas Percy, and it was therefore Percy's name that appeared on the first arrest warrant issued by the government. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread through London, prompting Christopher Wright \n\n In August 1605 Rookwood joined the Jesuits Henry Garnet and John Gerard on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Winefride's Well in Holywell.

Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song 4 out of 5 stars, noting its strength as a pop-rock anthem. musicOMH's Sara McDonnell was also impressed, saying that it had \"classic song' written all over it\". In December 2005, the song was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 48th Grammy Awards, but lost to \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\" by U2. \"One More Time\" is a song by English singer Alison Moyet, which was released in 2007 as the lead single from her seventh studio album The Turn. Speaking to Len Righi of The Morning Call, Moyet said of the song's lyrics: \"That's what relationships become after many, many years, when you recognise there's no more maneuvering with either of you and it's about dealing with the ennui.\" \"Better in Time\" is a pop and R&B song performed by British singer Leona Lewis. It is featured on Lewis's debut album Spirit (2007). Lewis promoted the song on several live television programmes, such as Good Morning America, Live with Regis and \n\n crossed over to the R&B and country formats, reaching number 42.

When Alexander tried to strip votes from Gilliard and Cox, Judge PIttman affirmed their offices, as well as single-member districts for the upcoming September election, and again denied Alexander a vote in school board meetings. Alexander called for Judge Pittman's removal, and rhetoric heated in 1980. In 2004, he was charged with marijuana possession after police found a marijuana cigarette, four grams of cocaine, and a loaded gun in the vehicle in which he was stopped. The driver of the car, Bernard Beckett, pleaded guilty to the gun charges. Magbie pleaded guilty to the marijuana. In 1965 Alexander's home was one of four homes bombed by someone trying to stifle the civil rights movement in Charlotte. Alexander's brother Frederick Alexander's home was hit along with civil rights lawyer Julius Chambers and activist Reginald Hawkins.

Channel 4 is largely commercially self-funded. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time. The broadcaster's news department Channel 4 News is broadcast weekday evenings at 7:00–8:00 pm, with a five minute summary at 12:00 noon. He hosted the \"Off the Wall\" show on the music channel, Music Box, before being given a job by ITV co-hosting arts and entertainment guide 01- For London in 1988. He appeared on the show for three series, also recording specials from Los Angeles, Moscow, Berlin and the Edinburgh Festival. Other presenting credits include an entertainment strand for BBC News 24, reviewing music videos on The Little Picture Show and hosting First Take, a series for first-time film makers on Anglia. He is also popular as a pundit; contributing to C4's Top Ten... and British Soul series and ITV's Tribes. Home Truths took essentially the same format as its predecessor, \n\n included Naomi Campbell and Jimmy Nail. There was considerable tabloid backlash against the show due to its often amateurish production standards - the presenters had little experience of live television. Originally broadcast in the old The Word time slot of 11pm on a Friday night, The Girlie Show later occupied Channel 4's traditional \"post-pub\" time slot. As with The Word, the late night air-time meant that guests and presenters encouraged each other to be controversial. In the tradition of The Word, the show's content and its presenters were heavily hyped as being more edgy, dangerous, and 'ballsy' than other programmes on British Television.\n\nQuestion: Which Channel 4 TV show's presenters included Mark Lamarr, Amanda De Cadenet and Terry Christian?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In some parts, the bow also features tiny metal bells. The string is traditionally made of horse hair but, sometimes, metal strings and strings made out of wood fiber are also used. The Stroh violin is much louder than a standard wooden violin, and its directional projection of sound made it particularly useful in the early days of phonographic recording. Wooden violins recorded poorly with the early acoustic-mechanical recording method, and the Stroh violin improved this by producing a fuller, louder sound. Today, there are two types of the instrument, bowed and percussion. The instrument may have a string, or not. The sound producing technique is also a little different from the modern violin technique. The Stroh violin or Stroviol is a type of stringed musical instrument that is mechanically amplified by a metal resonator and horn attached to its body. The name Stroviol refers to a violin, but other instruments have been modified with the amplification device, including the viola, cello, double bass, ukulele, mandolin, and guitar.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the device made of wood and horsehair that is used to play a violin?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A. m. mellifera can be broadly distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse \n\n A feeder is a vessel or contraption used by beekeepers to feed pollen or honey (or substitutes) to honey bees from a honey bee colony. Beekeepers feed bees when there is a shortage of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. Modern beekeepers feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Pollen substitute is commonly fed to bees in early spring or when bees are located in a region with poor pollen resources. Feeders may exist outside the hive, be designed to fit certain hive designs, be an integral part of a hive design, or be used separately inside the hive. Feeders may attach to the side of the hive, or slot into the flight entrance, or placed above or below the nest inside the hive or as a purpose-built hive component. Greek mythology has several gods who are associated with bees. The small hive beetle can be a destructive pest of honey bee colonies, causing damage to comb, stored honey, and pollen.

Bush. He is currently the oldest living former U.S. vice president, following the death of Walter Mondale in 2021. He attended Yale University before earning a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in political science from the University of Wyoming. After his selection by Republican primary voters as presumptive presidential nominee, Bush asked Dick Cheney to lead the selection committee for his vice president nominee. A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. In 1992, Bush had supported Cheney as a replacement for Dan Quayle on his father's ultimately unsuccessful national ticket. After more than three months of extensive research, Cheney recommended John Danforth to be the nominee, as the other choices' strengths were offset by liberal stances. Bush heavily considered Danforth, but ultimately asked Cheney himself to be the nominee. By picking Cheney, Bush had a running mate who had years of experience as well as an extensive foreign policy expertise. At the selection announcement, Bush said that Cheney, who had worked under all five presidential administrations between 1969 and 1993, was qualified, respected and shared his vision for America.\n\nQuestion: Who is the Vice-President for George W Bush?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The term \"wine\" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its \n\n fine poudre.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. These wines often had a slight fizz which would prickle the mouth. Although the definite answer is unclear, a contemporary work defined the term's origin thus: \"Thus, for instance, pinard, wine, was all but unknown in Paris before the war, yet it is now perhaps the most famous word in the whole soldier vocabulary.

They reach sexual maturity at 325 days. This is the longest maturation period of any of the apes. During this period, the offspring learns the intricate task of weaving a sleeping platform. Capuchins can mate year-round but females will give birth every two years. A female’s gestation period is 150-180 days and give birth to one infant. Males reach maturity and are fertile around 6-8 years. The Philippine tarsier's gestation period lasts about six months, while the female's estrous cycle lasts 25–28 days. The mating season lasts from April to May. The female gives birth to one offspring per gestation. Gestation lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation, so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus Dasypus give birth to four monozygotic young (that is, identical quadruplets), but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight.

The flooded region also allows beavers access to food, especially during the winter. In some areas, the presence of certain species (such as beavers) can be beneficial for flood control reasons. Beavers build and maintain beaver dams which will reduce the height of flood waves moving down the river (during periods of heavy rains), and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures, at the cost of minor flooding near the dams (often on farmland). Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity.

This is explained at \n\n The Pink Panther is an American media franchise primarily focusing on a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The franchise began with the release of the classic Pink Panther film in 1963. Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini. The first film in the series had an animated opening sequence, created by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, featuring \"The Pink Panther Theme\" by Mancini, as well as the Pink Panther character. The cartoon series gained its highest profile on television, aired on Saturday mornings as The Pink Panther Show. Henry Nicola Mancini (born Enrico Nicola Mancini; April 16, 1924 – June 14, 1994) was an American composer, conductor, arranger, pianist and flautist. Often cited as one of the greatest composers in the history of film, he won four Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and twenty Grammy Awards, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His works include the theme and soundtrack for the Peter Gunn television series as well as the music for The Pink Panther film series (\"The Pink Panther Theme\") and \"Moon River\" from Breakfast at Tiffany's. Mancini enjoyed a long collaboration composing film scores for the film director Blake Edwards. 1 hit single during the rock era on the Hot 100: his arrangement and recording of the \"Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet\" spent two weeks at the top, starting with the week ending June 28, 1969.\n\n reprise for many of the Pink Panther series entries, as well as the cartoon series, Mancini composed different theme music for A Shot in the Dark; this theme was later adopted by the animated spin-off series The Inspector.

It resulted in deflation and unemployment, and was a catalyst to the miners' strike that led to the General Strike of 1926. Churchill's other policies as Chancellor included free trade, a reduction in the rate of local taxation, lowering the pension age and support for coal miners and the mining industry. In October 1964, Conservative Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (who had only been in power for twelve months since the resignation of Harold Macmillan) was forced to call a general election, the parliament being about to expire. The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems; Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as the new chancellor of the Exchequer.

Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development. Mammals do not necessarily have the same human chorionic gonadotropin released from their embryo. In mammals, chemical signals and the scent glands that secrete them have many features in common, for example, expression in only one sex, development only in adults, often only secreted in breeding season and used exclusively in mating. For an odour to stimulate sexual behavior exclusively, \n\n Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete \n\n Most mammals develop similarly to Homo sapiens; during the earliest stages of development, the embryo is largely indistinguishable from another mammal. However, there are phenomena found in human beings not found in all other mammals, as well as phenomena occurring in other mammals, but not in humans.\n\nQuestion: Apart from being warm blooded and giving birth to live young, what do mammals produce to differentiate them from other families of animals?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the \n\n Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities, beginning with the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919. Despite the general public having little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music.

Ruddy made his debut on 24 December 1932, when \n\n to establish a place in the team during his time at the Racecourse Ground and the Red Dragons decided against extending the loan beyond the initial month. On 21 April 2007, Ruddy completed an emergency one-week loan to League One club Bristol City, and helped them move closer to promotion, by playing one match – a 3–1 win over Carlisle United, and later joked he would ask if he were eligible for a runners-up medal as City finished second and won promotion. John Thomas Gordon Ruddy (born 24 October 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United, before signing for Everton as a 19-year-old. Ruddy was signed by Paul Lambert to play for Norwich City in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the Championship, gaining promotion to the Premier League. The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager Roy Hodgson for the squad for Euro 2012. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017.

Currently Vyrus has four models: 984 C3 2V (Ducati-sourced 2-valve 1000 cm3 air-cooled engine developing 100bhp), 985 C3 4V (Ducati-sourced 4-valve 1000 cm3 water-cooled engine developing 155bhp), 987 C3 4V (Ducati-sourced 4-valve 1200 cm3 water cooled engine developing 184bhp) and the 987 C3 4VV (Ducati-sourced 4-valve 1200 cm3 supercharged water cooled engine developing 211bhp). Vyrus is very much a \"bespoke\" manufacturer - individual bikes are built to order, with no two bikes being the same. The Ducati 899 Panigale is a 898 cc sport bike from Ducati, released in 2013 to replace the 848. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The unconventional decision to use a two-sided swingarm on a superbike from Ducati was made because of the substantial upgrades added to the bike including electronically adjustable anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic braking control, and a quickshifter. The 899 surprised observers by topping sales charts for all motorcycles in the UK for December 2013, at a price five times higher than the number two seller, the Honda CBF125 — a situation compared by The Telegraph to the Ferrari California outselling the Ford Focus. For 2016, Ducati revised the 899, including enlarging the engine to 955 cc (the 959 Panigale). The Ducati Panigale V2 is a 955 cc (58.3 cu in) sport bike manufactured by Ducati as the successor to the Panigale 959. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale.

That initial broadcast was, in the words of co-producer Dan Enright, \"a dismal failure\", as the two contestants were so lacking in the required knowledge that they answered a large number of the questions incorrectly. According to Enright in a 1992 PBS documentary, \"from that moment on, we decided to rig Twenty-One.\" Three months into its run, Twenty-One featured a contestant, Herb Stempel, who had been coached by Enright to allow his opponent, Charles Van Doren, to win the game. In Series 1 and 2, each episode featured one or more special guest celebrities, who often took part in a number of tricks during the show, and sometimes participated in the show's closing illusion. In series 3, the format was redesigned with Mulhern presenting and a 'Tricky Team' of young magicians performing the illusions. Collyer would ask them general questions (usually including where they were from and how long they'd been married) and usually asked if they had children, their ages and genders. Collyer usually would talk to the children, asking them what they wanted to be when they grew up, or, if the kids were not at the show, to have their parents wave to them on TV. Collyer would often ask the husband \n\n he failed the civil service exam. ; Leonard Ross, who at age 10 won a combined $164,000 on The Big Surprise and The $64,000 Challenge, suffered from major mental health issues, including depression and attention deficit disorder, which limited his ability to work as an author and attorney in adulthood; most of his work was completed by other co-authors.\n\nQuestion: Name the game show, presented by Leslie Grantham and Melinda Messenger, where contestants were set physical and mental challenges?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When in the 20th century the names of Titans were exhausted, the moons were named after different characters of the Greco-Roman mythology or giants from other mythologies. All the irregular moons (except Phoebe) are named after Inuit and Gallic gods and after Norse ice giants. Some asteroids share the same names as moons of Saturn: 55 Pandora, 106 Dione, 577 Rhea, 1809 Prometheus, 1810 Epimetheus, and 4450 Pan. In addition, two more asteroids previously shared the names of Saturnian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the International Astronomical Union (IAU): Calypso and asteroid 53 Kalypso; and Helene and asteroid 101 Helena. The practice was to name newly discovered moons of Jupiter after lovers and favorites of the god Jupiter (Zeus) and, since 2004, also after their descendants. All of Jupiter's satellites from XXXIV (Euporie) onward are named after descendants of Jupiter or Zeus, except LIII (Dia), named after a lover of Jupiter. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 76 known moons \n\n The Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610. The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century, whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12). Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name Amalthea by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.

Aside from these women, the three Synoptic Gospels speak of the presence of others: \"the chief priests, with the scribes and elders\"; two robbers crucified, one on Jesus' right and one on his left, whom the Gospel of Luke presents as the penitent thief and the impenitent thief; \"the soldiers\", \"the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus\"; passers-by; \"bystanders\", \"the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle\"; and \"his acquaintances\". The Gospel of John also speaks of women present, but only mentions the soldiers and \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\". The Gospels also tell of the arrival, after the death of Jesus, of Joseph of Arimathea and of Nicodemus. have subtly shaped their accounts of Jesus's healing miracles to resemble familiar Greek stories about miracles associated with Asclepius, the god of healing and medicine. The birth narratives of Matthew and Luke are usually seen by secular historians as legends designed to fulfill Jewish expectations about the Messiah. The Gospel of John bears indirect influences from Platonism, via earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, and may also have been influenced in less obvious ways by the cult of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, though this possibility is still disputed. Later Christian traditions about Jesus were probably influenced by Greco-Roman religion and mythology. Nicodemus appears here, in chapter and is listed in John, and only in John, as helping Joseph of Arimathea to bury Jesus. They are visited by wise men who bring gifts to the newborn Messiah.\n\nQuestion: The Bible tells of 3 wise men visiting Jesus after his birth, but in which of the Gospels does this appear?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They can especially help dogs with hip issues and dogs with neurological conditions making them less aware of their self-movement (proprioception). Another form of orthotic is a leg brace that can improve stabilization for issues caused by age, worn-out bones in the foot, or something more serious like ectrodactyly. This is the deficiency of one or more central digits of the hand or foot, causing the animal's foot to become deformed. In terrestrial vertebrates, digitigrade locomotion is walking or running on the toes (from the Latin digitus, 'finger', and gradior, 'walk'). A digitigrade animal is one that stands or walks with its toes (metatarsals) touching the ground, and the rest of its foot lifted. Digitigrades include walking birds (what many assume to be bird knees are actually ankles), cats, dogs, and many other mammals, but not plantigrades or unguligrades. There are anatomical differences between the limbs of plantigrades, like humans, and both unguligrade and digitigrade limbs. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's \"hands\" and \"feet\" correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits, while in digitigrade animals, more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs).\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the small fifth claw called on the side of a dog's foot ?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Initially they were designed for airplane wire harnesses. The original design used a metal tooth, and these can still be obtained. Manufacturers later changed to the nylon/plastic design. Ty-Rap cable tie inventor, Maurus C. Logan, worked for Thomas & Betts and finished his career with the company as Vice President of Research and Development. Much bobbin lace is based on a net ground. The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly \"figure 8\" cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Some clips have a small badge indicating membership to a club or some other affiliation, or some other commemorative token, in a similar manner to the way in which ties themselves may be used as signs of membership. A cable tie (also known as a hose tie, zip tie, or by the brand name Ty-Rap) is a type of fastener, for holding items together, primarily electrical cables, and wires. Because of their low cost, ease of use, and binding strength, cable ties are ubiquitous, finding use in a wide range of other applications. The common cable tie, normally made of nylon, has a flexible tape section with teeth that engage with a pawl in the head to form a ratchet so that as the free end of the tape section is pulled the cable tie tightens and does not come undone.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the plastic bit on the end of shoelaces?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Other rivers such as the Danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the Alps. The Rhine originates in a 30 km2 area in Switzerland and represents almost 60% of water exported from the country. Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD, would describe the Vistula as the border between Germania and Sarmatia. The Vistula river used to be connected to the Dnieper River, and thence to the Black Sea via the Augustów Canal, a technological marvel with numerous sluices contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It was the first waterway in Central Europe to provide a direct link between the two major rivers, the Vistula and the Neman. The Baltic Sea&ndash; Vistula&ndash; Dnieper&ndash; Black Sea \n\n outflow. The dense Mediterranean water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of 23 - 30 m, then flows through the Dardanelles Strait and into the Sea of Marmara at velocities of 5 - 15 cm/s. The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.

The bridge is some 500 metres in length. The bridge was designed by in 1893; he built several bridges on the Danube, including the Liberty Bridge (originally the Franz Joseph Bridge) in Budapest and the Elisabeth Bridge between Komárno and Komárom. Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD, would describe the Vistula as the border between Germania and Sarmatia. The Vistula river used to be connected to the Dnieper River, and thence to the Black Sea via the Augustów Canal, a technological marvel with numerous sluices contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It was the first waterway in Central Europe to provide a direct link between the two major rivers, the Vistula and the Neman. For other uses, see Vistula (disambiguation). It flows through Poland's largest cities, including Kraków, Sandomierz, Warsaw, Płock, Włocławek, Toruń, Bydgoszcz, Świecie, Grudziądz, Tczew and Gdańsk. The river is often associated with Polish culture, history and national identity. It is the country's most important waterway and natural symbol, and the term \"Vistula Land\" (kraj nad Wisłą) can be synonymous with Poland. The Danube crosses the city from the west to the south-east. The Middle Danube basin begins at Devín Gate in western Bratislava. Other rivers nearby are the Morava River, which forms the north-western border of the city and flows into the Danube at Devín, the Little Danube, and the Vydrica, which flows into the Danube at the borough of Karlova Ves.\n\nQuestion: The River Danube runs through which three European capital cities?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants. Cut-backs ; 180° rotations ; 360° rotations ; Serial jumps ; Power slides ; Freeriding There are two main styles of water skurfing: noseriding – mostly used by people who surf on a longboard – or using cutbacks, carves, and other turns. The maneuvers on a skurfboard are similar to those on a surfboard. The latest style of skurfing is riding with the fins removed from the bottom of the board. Not having fins limits cutbacks and carving, but allows the rider to spin the board around in a 360-degree rotation. The upwards wiping of the nose and nostrils allows for running mucus to be wiped off quickly and easily. Also, as the nostrils are being pushed up the air passages through the nose become temporarily propped open. Habitual as well as fast or rough saluting may also result in a crease (known as a transverse nasal crease or groove) running across the nose, and can lead to permanent physical deformity observable in childhood and adulthood.

As the hand slides upward, the tip of the nose is pressed up, thus creating the crease. Wry nose is a deviation of the rostral maxilla, meaning that the upper jaw and nose are deviated to one side. This usually causes the nasal septum (the cartilage plate that separates the right and left nasal passageways) to be deviated as well, resulting in obstruction of the airway, and breathing difficulties.

The earliest attempt to build a railway line dedicated for operation at the higher speeds was the Great Central Main Line, opened by the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1899. This line was an ambitious project led by railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin who envisaged a Liverpool-Paris route crossing from Britain to France via a proposed channel tunnel. The line was built to certain specifications so that it could take advantage of the higher speeds offered by \n\n Lime Street Station. Early regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) and Collins Line and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines Cunard Line and White Star Line continuing throughout the 19th Century. Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago.

A villager, the father of a wayward girl, is murdered and Richard (Fenton), the brother of Carlyle's former sweetheart Barbara (Daw), is accused. Lady Isabel learns that her oldest child is ill and, posing as a nurse, goes to him and nurses him to health. Then she becomes ill and dies, happy in the thought she has saved her child's life and that Carlyle, who had recognized her, will keep her secret. She flees reality, hiding away in her bedroom, listening to records and impersonating the voices of American and British artists such as Marilyn Monroe, Gracie Fields, Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey; her love of songs is her only source of strength since her beloved father's death.

In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997. For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized. An earlier list, publicized in June 1963, \n\n A 1978 proposal for a nationwide system of community networks suggested using ZIP Codes for routing. ZIP Code data is an integral part of dealer / store locator software on many websites, especially brick-and-click websites. As the ZIP Code system is confined to the U.S. These developed into postal codes as they are defined today. The name of US postal codes, \"ZIP codes\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \"ZIP\".\n\nQuestion: In which decade were ZIP codes introduced in the USA?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Conversely foxes were often seen as \"witch animals\", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: \"Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes \n\n A kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50.
