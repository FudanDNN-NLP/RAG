The film's opening theme song, \"Nobody Knows\", also composed by Legrand/ Bergman/ Bergman and performed in the film by Richie Havens, has also been covered a number of times, including by Natalie Cole, Lena Horne, Jack Jones, Kiri Te Kanawa, and Bill Medley.

It was designed by the Austrian architect Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The heart of the garden was a courtyard surrounded by a three-tiered loggia, which served as a theater for entertainments. The Venetian Ambassador described the Cortile del Belvedere in 1523: \"One enters a very beautiful garden, of which half is filled with growing grass and bays and mulberries and cypresses, while the other half is paved with squares of bricks laid upright, and in every square a beautiful orange \n\n public. The impression evokes the two marble halls in the Upper and Lower Belvedere. Hildebrandt used the best available artists for the decoration. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ altarpiece was painted by Neapolitan painter Francesco Solimena over a period of ten years and completed in 1729.

        "context": " Belvedere Palace Chapel is a chapel located in the south eastern corner tower of the Upper Belvedere in Vienna, Austria. It was designed by the Austrian architect Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The heart of the garden was a courtyard surrounded by a three-tiered loggia, which served as a theater for entertainments. The Venetian Ambassador described the Cortile del Belvedere in 1523: \"One enters a very beautiful garden, of which half is filled with growing grass and bays and mulberries and cypresses, while the other half is paved with squares of bricks laid upright, and in every square a beautiful orange \n\n public. The impression evokes the two marble halls in the Upper and Lower Belvedere. Hildebrandt used the best available artists for the decoration. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ altarpiece was painted by Neapolitan painter Francesco Solimena over a period of ten years and completed in 1729. A model of Solimena's altarpiece by Santino Bussi is displayed in the hall next to the chapel. The Galerie Neue Meister (, New Masters Gallery) in Dresden, Germany, displays around 300 paintings from the 19th century until today, including works from Otto Dix, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet.

Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill. The stabilization policy brought about after Khrushchev's removal established a ruling gerontocracy, and political corruption became a normal phenomenon.

DiMaggio was the youngest of three brothers who each became major league center fielders, the others being Joe and Vince. According to Joe DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer, the iconic younger brother \"didn't deal with Vince at all\", never maintaining any meaningful relationship with him. But earlier in his career, DiMaggio had also joked that \"If I could hit like Joe and he could talk like me, we'd make a helluva guy.\" DiMaggio once said of brother Joe: \"Joe was one heckuva player. But if our brother Cooper had not gotten hurt, he would be considered the greatest ballplayer who ever lived\". DiMaggio enjoyed a close friendship with teammates Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Johnny Pesky, which was chronicled in David Halberstam's book The Teammates. He and his wife Emily, whom he married in 1948, had two sons (Paul and Peter), a daughter (Emily), and several grandchildren (Alex, Andrew, Charlotte, Margel, \n\n who had each become major league center fielders: Joe was a star with the rival New York Yankees, and Vince played for five National League teams.

The two songs that kept it from number one were \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\" by Christopher Cross and \"Private Eyes\" by Hall & Oates.

The other acts that remained at number one for at least three weeks were Blondie, Kool & the Gang, and Juice Newton.

The two songs that kept it from number one were \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\" by Christopher Cross and \"Private Eyes\" by Hall & Oates. Because no RPM issues were published between 11 July and 22 August, it remained at number one for 12 weeks, preventing the second-most-successful single of the year, \"Bette Davis Eyes\" by Kim Carnes, from taking the position. The singer who stayed at number one for the most weeks this year was John Lennon, whose singles \"(Just Like) Starting Over\" and \"Woman\" gave him seven weeks at the summit. The other acts that remained at number one for at least three weeks were Blondie, Kool & the Gang, and Juice Newton. Bonnie Tyler had major hits with \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" and \"Holding Out for a Hero\", while Robert Palmer's had two iconic music videos for \"Addicted to Love\" and \"Simply Irresistible\".

Al Tajir also owns London's Sheraton Park Tower Hotel at 101 Knightsbridge near Hyde Park and Mereworth Castle in Kent, which he purchased in 1976 for $1.2 million. In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner Hani Salaam. Al Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai's aluminum smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the Dubai World Trade Centre. In the judgement of a British court case, Al Tajir conspired to defraud Dubai Aluminium of millions of dollars in connivance with commodities trader Marc Rich, who owned a neighbouring property in Switzerland. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the Dubai World Trade Centre. Al Tajir's influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain's future profits at risk. In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai's Department of Economic Development. In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman. Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities.

Al Tajir also owns London's Sheraton Park Tower Hotel at 101 Knightsbridge near Hyde Park and Mereworth Castle in Kent, which he purchased in 1976 for $1.2 million. In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner Hani Salaam. Al Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai's aluminum smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the Dubai World Trade Centre. In the judgement of a British court case, Al Tajir conspired to defraud Dubai Aluminium of millions of dollars in connivance with commodities trader Marc Rich, who owned a neighbouring property in Switzerland. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the Dubai World Trade Centre. Al Tajir's influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain's future profits at risk. In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai's Department of Economic Development. In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman. Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities. Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz's Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Al Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed's offer of a formal partnership.

In May 1942, American and Australian forces defeated the Japanese in the Battle of the Coral Sea, prompting a Japanese land campaign across the island of New Guinea. Seeking to seize control of a strategically-placed island and destroy the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, Japan also launched an attack on the American-held Midway Atoll. With the assistance of the Magic cryptanalysis project, Admiral Chester Nimitz led an American force that defeated the Japanese navy at the Battle \n\n Midway. In August 1942, the United States launched an invasion of the Japanese-held South Pacific island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands; Japanese and American forces contested control of Guadalcanal until February 1943. After the Battle of Guadalcanal, the U.S. adopted an island hopping strategy in order to avoid entrenched Japanese garrisons. While the campaign in \n\n Southwest Pacific continued, U.S. forces launched an offensive in the Central Pacific, beginning with the November 1943 Battle of Tarawa.\n\n"

Having been recognised for his peace efforts in a segment on ITV's Man of the Decade documentary, and then chosen as Rolling Stone magazine's \"Man of the Year\" \n\n John Lennon and Yoko Ono moved to New York City in September 1971 and continued their involvement in political, peace and social justice causes of the counterculture era. When they settled in Greenwich Village, in October, they were quickly contacted by activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman who persuaded them to appear at an upcoming rally for left-wing writer John Sinclair, who had been jailed for possession of two marijuana joints. The Lennons also spoke out on the Attica Prison riots, jailing of Angela Davis and oppression of women. The book disputes the official view of Lennon as a contented househusband raising his son Sean and baking bread while Yoko ran the family business. Instead, Nowhere Man portrays Lennon's daily life at the Dakota as that of a \"tormented superstar, a prisoner of his fame, locked in his bedroom raving about Jesus Christ, while a retinue of servants tended to his every need.\" The final part of the book, The Coda, focuses on the mental disintegration of Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman, and includes Chapter 27, the so-called missing chapter of J.D.\n\n"

The emblem of the African Union consists of a gold ribbon bearing small interlocking red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders. The flag was featured on the cantons of the flags of government agencies such the military, prisons service, and police. the flag was mistakenly put on posters in Ghana advertising that year's Africa Cup of Nations, sparking indignation among some South Africans. The flag was declared illegal for public display in South Africa in August 2019, when the Equality Court classified it as hate speech, with heavy enforcing penalties. Judge Phineas Mojapelo declared it to be \"Displaying [the apartheid flag] is destructive of our nascent non-racial democracy… it is an affront to the spirit and values of botho / ubuntu, which has become a mark of civilized interaction in post-apartheid South Africa\". The Emblem of the Republic of Abkhazia was adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia on 23 July 1992, after it declared its secession from Georgia. The emblem of separatist Republic of Abkhazia is a shield divided vertically into white and green.\n\n"

Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II \n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911. The main liturgical language for Masses is Russian, but services are also held\n\n"

To solve the problem of energy shortage after the deforestation in the area, Rhenanus experimented with brown coal beginning in 1563, which was discovered a few years earlier in the area of the nearby mountain \"Hoher Meissner\". The brown coal burned worse than the charcoal, whose technology was better known. Densified coal is the product of the Coldry Process coal upgrading technology that removes moisture from low-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite/brown coal. The densification process raises the calorific value of low-rank coal to equal or exceed that of many export-grade black coals. Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal.

        "context": " Essentially, brown coal is sheared and attritioned reducing the mean particle size and releasing water naturally held in the porous coal microstructure forming a plastic mass. When applied to lignite and some sub-bituminous coals, the Coldry process produces a feedstock in the form of densified pellets that significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared \n\n The chemical and calorific values of densified coal derived from typical Victorian brown coal with a natural average moisture content of 60 per cent by weight compares well with typical high grade black coal exported from Tarong Queensland, and Newcastle New South Wales Australia. To solve the problem of energy shortage after the deforestation in the area, Rhenanus experimented with brown coal beginning in 1563, which was discovered a few years earlier in the area of the nearby mountain \"Hoher Meissner\". The brown coal burned worse than the charcoal, whose technology was better known. Densified coal is the product of the Coldry Process coal upgrading technology that removes moisture from low-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite/brown coal. The densification process raises the calorific value of low-rank coal to equal or exceed that of many export-grade black coals. Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal. A relatively high altitude formation, Maddingley brown coal is distinguished as having 60 per cent moisture content and a rich fulvic acid and humic acid content.\n\n"

Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called \"soldier\" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their \"duties\" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation in the size\n\n"

When glucose levels are elevated, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin. They found that there were changes \n\n Dulaglutide binds to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors, slowing gastric emptying and increases insulin secretion by pancreatic Beta cells. Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. GLP-1 is normally secreted by L cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa in response to a meal. The formation of the pancreas from endoderm begins in early development.

If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. According to the cosmological principle, the random distribution of matter and energy within the different parts of the universe must be approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and that random overdensities of these objects must be small if projected on a large enough scale. Given also its proximity to the Huge-LQG, CCLQG and U1.54, it will be a big contradiction to the modern cosmological model. The premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the physical constants would make the universe radically different. The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life.\" This is an idea where a large amount of universes are located in \"the Landscape\"; he expands by communicating that each universe has different physics laws that govern each of them, as can be seen in the quote above.

        "context": "On their theory, it is inevitable that we find our universe's \"fine-tuned\" physical constants, as the current universe \"selects\" only those past histories that led to the present conditions. If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. According to the cosmological principle, the random distribution of matter and energy within the different parts of the universe must be approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and that random overdensities of these objects must be small if projected on a large enough scale. Given also its proximity to the Huge-LQG, CCLQG and U1.54, it will be a big contradiction to the modern cosmological model. The premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the physical constants would make the universe radically different. The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life.\" This is an idea where a large amount of universes are located in \"the Landscape\"; he expands by communicating that each universe has different physics laws that govern each of them, as can be seen in the quote above. The anthropic principle is also present in the idea. He claims, for example, that we are only here because our universe has the precise set of laws of physics that it has, and that very few universes have the laws of physics needed for intelligent life.\n\n"

Getting close enough to the regular ghosts turns them rainbow-colored and they may also be added to the trail. A slow-motion effect automatically kicks in whenever a ghost gets too close to Pac-Man, which offers players the chance to make a last-minute attempt to avoid being caught. Players can also use a limited supply of bombs that return all the ghosts to the center of the maze, although it lowers the dot multiplier and game speed. Gameplay revolves around three main modes: Score Attack, in which players attempt to get the highest score within 5 or 10 minutes; Time Attack, consisting \n\n for the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures animated series. such as bombs that send all ghosts to the regeneration box and sleeping ghosts that will give chase when Pac-Man moves past them.

Ingram stated his songs had become \"bigger and more epic, more Broadway and more cinematic over time\", and Hasbro blessed the effort to try \"something groundbreaking for daytime television\". A large musical number in \"The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000\" paid homage to the song \"Ya Got Trouble\" from The Music Man. & Dave had previously been offered the chance to record the theme song for another BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, but turned it down as they were in Australia at the time due to the success of \"Ain't No Pleasing You\". However, their song \"Margate\" was used in a feature-length episode of the series entitled \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\" in 1989. They also created the theme tune and incidental music for the children television show Bangers and Mash, and recorded the title theme for Crackerjack! \"Snooker Loopy\", a comic song about snooker, was released as a single in May 1986 and entered the UK Singles Chart, reaching number six. 1) \"Morning in Ponyville\" ; 2) \"What My Cutie Mark is Telling Me\" ; 3) \"I've Got To Find a Way\" ; 4) \"A True, True Friend\" ; 5) \"Celestia's Ballad\" ; 6) \"Behold, Princess Twilight Sparkle\" ; 7) \"Life in Equestria\" The episode is primarily a musical. The show's composer Daniel Ingram created seven songs with episode's writer, M.A. The song played over the end credits is \"My Rifle, My Pony and Me\" by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, from the 1959 Western Rio Bravo. Tony is seen watching this movie (and specifically, the scene in which the song appears) in the Season Four premiere, \"For All Debts Public and Private\". ; The song playing in the Crazy Horse club when Adrianna walks in on Tony and Ralph in her office is \"Can't Stand It\" by The Greenhornes.\n\n"

In some parts, the bow also features tiny metal bells. The string is traditionally made of horse hair but, sometimes, metal strings and strings made out of wood fiber are also used. The Stroh violin is much louder than a standard wooden violin, and its directional projection of sound made it particularly useful in the early days of phonographic recording. Wooden violins recorded poorly with the early acoustic-mechanical recording method, and the Stroh violin improved this by producing a fuller, louder sound. Today, there are two types of the instrument, bowed and percussion. The instrument may have a string, or not. The sound producing technique is also a little different from the modern violin technique. The Stroh violin or Stroviol is a type of stringed musical instrument that is mechanically amplified by a metal resonator and horn attached to its body.

        "context": "The bow is wooden and bears a curved flourish at one end which is made of metal. In some parts, the bow also features tiny metal bells. The string is traditionally made of horse hair but, sometimes, metal strings and strings made out of wood fiber are also used. The Stroh violin is much louder than a standard wooden violin, and its directional projection of sound made it particularly useful in the early days of phonographic recording. Wooden violins recorded poorly with the early acoustic-mechanical recording method, and the Stroh violin improved this by producing a fuller, louder sound. Today, there are two types of the instrument, bowed and percussion. The instrument may have a string, or not. The sound producing technique is also a little different from the modern violin technique. The Stroh violin or Stroviol is a type of stringed musical instrument that is mechanically amplified by a metal resonator and horn attached to its body. The name Stroviol refers to a violin, but other instruments have been modified with the amplification device, including the viola, cello, double bass, ukulele, mandolin, and guitar.\n\n"

The term \"wine\" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its \n\n fine poudre.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. These wines often had a slight fizz which would prickle the mouth. Although the definite answer is unclear, a contemporary work defined the term's origin thus: \"Thus, for instance, pinard, wine, was all but unknown in Paris before the war, yet it is now perhaps the most famous word in the whole soldier vocabulary.

This tradition goes back to the times of the ancient Romans when \n\n contexts and also found popularity in the kitchen and medicinal spheres. The term \"wine\" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its \n\n fine poudre.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850. These wines often had a slight fizz which would prickle the mouth. Although the definite answer is unclear, a contemporary work defined the term's origin thus: \"Thus, for instance, pinard, wine, was all but unknown in Paris before the war, yet it is now perhaps the most famous word in the whole soldier vocabulary. The second syllable is an orthodox ending, and pinaud is the name of a well-known small Burgundy grape.\"\n\n"

It resulted in deflation and unemployment, and was a catalyst to the miners' strike that led to the General Strike of 1926. Churchill's other policies as Chancellor included free trade, a reduction in the rate of local taxation, lowering the pension age and support for coal miners and the mining industry.

In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997. For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963.

        "context": "  A ZIP Code is a postal code used by the United States Postal Service (USPS). In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997. For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized.
