You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

House eventually selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) and Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde) as his new team; Foreman rejoins soon after. Following Kutner's death in season five, through a series of plot twists, House reacquires Chase, one of the original team members. When House resigns early in season six, Foreman takes his place, but he soon fires Thirteen, and Taub quits because he was there only to work with House.

  After the events in "Twenty Vicodin", House is two months into the additional eight added to his sentence. However, Eric Foreman (who is now the new Dean of Medicine, because Cuddy resigned the day after the events of "Moving On") makes House an offer: he would receive the opportunity for conditional release and return to the PPTH team to treat a set of donor lungs that are failing, organs that Wilson's patient (Liza Snyder) needs. House is working in medicine again, but he realizes that many things have changed: he now has a tiny office, has a limited supply of Vicodin, lost his team

  why he is ignoring him is because he is spending time with his girlfriend, Cuddy. Wilson doesn't buy it and thinks that House is back on Vicodin. He is then convinced that House is not back on it after checking his blood pressure and pupils. After spending the day together, House tells Cuddy that he knows that the relationship is not going to work. Nevertheless, at the end he tells her for the first time that he loves her and Cuddy eventually leaves. Meanwhile, Dr. Richardson (George Wyner), the hospital's neurosurgeon, goes home with severe nausea. Without a neurosurgeon on site, the hospital's accreditation as a Level 1 Trauma Center

  In the aftermath of last season's finale in which House and Cuddy admitted they had feelings for each other, the seventh season opener finds the two exploring the ramifications of those feelings and attempting to make a real relationship work. Wilson who is worried about House since he did not show up to work goes to House's apartment, knocks on the door and calls his cell. Cuddy tells him to let him in but House says no, and Wilson eventually leaves. Later on Wilson comes back and climbs through House's kitchen window. Wilson is concerned that House may be throwing away a drug free year. House tells him that the

Her early film roles have included Catherine Parr in Henry VIII and His Six Wives (1972), Bequest to the Nation (1973) and Oh Heavenly Dog (1980). Her most famous movie role is probably in Alfred Hitchcock's penultimate film Frenzy (1972), as a woman raped and strangled by a serial killer, that included the first graphically violent scene featuring visible nudity of Hitchcock's career. In 1983 Leigh-Hunt appeared as the Queen of Bavaria in the mini-series Wagner, sharing her scenes with Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud as court ministers.

  She was born in Chicago, Illinois, and died in Hollywood, California. Eve was an American scenarist who was known to also use the pseudonym Oliver W. Geoffreys as well as E.M. Unsell. Eve was married to a man named Lester Blankfield, but the year is disputed. Records list their marriage year as 1911, but it does not match up with other documentation. Eve Unsell was a professional in her career as a scenarist, overcoming many challenges along the way. Eve wrote for over 96 films in her lifetime, and edited over ten. Some of her most famous screen writes turned into productions include Shadows (1922), The Ancient Mariner (1925), The Plastic Age (1925), and The Spirit of Youth (1929). Although she was most famous for her work in scenario writing she can also be given credit as an adapter, company director, editor, play reader, screenwriter, theatre actress, and writer. She helped in the writing of many novels as long as editing many different pieces from literature to theatrical writing.

He offered Annabella a multi-movie deal that would take her overseas. She refused to leave Power, and on completion of Suez, she returned to France to obtain a divorce from her then-husband, Jean Murat. Power and she married on 23 April 1939. The two honeymooned in Rome. Within a few months, Annabella and Power had again flown to Europe to bring Annabella's mother back to live in their home, while her father and brother stayed behind.

As Leigh was preparing to leave, the wardrobe department cut a hole in her shoes so that her toe would be at ease. According to Leigh, she was forced to pay for her own shoes and demanded that MGM help her make some of the payments. On the other hand, MGM said that they bought all of Leigh's shoes and she didn't have to pay a penny on the film. Because of the dispute, her manager, Alexander Korda, sent Leigh a message stating

In her biography My Mother Was Nuts, Penny Marshall states she was slated to direct (this would have been her first feature film) from a script by John Hughes (which would have been his first script to be adapted for film). This version of the screenplay consisted of several unrelated vignettes. The producers wanted to have Belushi wearing diapers on the poster, even though no such scene appeared in Hughes' screenplay. Martha Coolidge was fired from the movie, for cutting many scenes of gratuitous nudity, but declined an opportunity to have her directing credit appear as Alan Smithee.

  were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were "feasting on an unfortunate situation", insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month, saying "David Elfick doesn't seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'" Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.

['The film "Vedam" is a psychological thriller that explores the themes of identity, memory, and perception. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows the story of a man named Edward (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who wakes up in a hospital with no memory of who he is or how he got there. As he tries to piece together his past, he begins to uncover a web of lies and deceit that threatens to destroy everything he thought he knew about himself and the world around him.\n\nThe film is set in a dystopian future where technology has advanced to the point where memories can be implanted and manipulated. This theme is explored through the use of non-linear storytelling, with the narrative jumping back and forth in time to reveal different perspectives and truths.\n\nThe cinematography in "Vedam" is stunning, with Nolan\'s signature use of practical effects and minimal CGI. The film\'s score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is haunting and atmospheric, adding to the film\'s overall sense of unease and tension.\n\nThe performances in "Vedam" are exceptional, with DiCaprio delivering a nuanced and emotionally charged portrayal of a man struggling to come to terms with his identity. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are equally impressive, adding', 'Vedam was written and directed by Christopher Nolan.']

  Vedi tells the story of Prabhakaran (Vishal), a young police officer who goes to Kolkata in search of his sister Aishwarya (Poonam Kaur).

The enmity reaches Kolkata when Easwaramoorthy joins another local gangster to take revenge on Prabhakaran. The baddies trouble Aishwarya and her friend Parvathy (Sameera Reddy), who falls in love with Prabhakaran. While the enmity between Prabhakaran and Easwaramoorthy continues, a flashback of Prabhakaran goes on. Prabhakaran and Aishwarya were ill-treated by the society as their father was a smuggler.

The filmmakers met in Mumbai in early May to lock their segments after six-weeks long online interactions and discussions. Due to Thiyagarajan Kumararaja's unavailability, Gautham Menon agreed to direct his script. However, in November 2013 it was reported that Menon was also out of the project, although he had started shooting his part in July in Puducherry, and Nalan Kumarasamy, director of Soodhu Kavvum subsequently replaced him to direct Kumararaja's segment.

['In the sequel to the 1997 hit, Men in Black II, eight children are featured in a scene where they are being protected by the Men in Black agents. The scene takes place in a school, where the children are being held hostage by a group of aliens. The agents, played by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, must use their advanced technology and skills to rescue the children and stop the aliens from causing chaos on Earth. The children, who are all under the age of 12, are portrayed by actors who were carefully selected for their ability to convey a sense of fear and vulnerability. The scene is intense and action-packed, with explosions, gunfire, and alien attacks. However, it also has a heartwarming moment where the agents comfort the children and assure them that they will be safe. The scene is a highlight of the movie and has been praised for its emotional impact.', 'Men in Black II stars eight children.']

  guidance counselor or a trip to the principal's office are now handled by the police. Students are denied basic constitutional rights. They can be searched, drug-tested, forced to incriminate themselves, and capriciously punished. Surveillance cameras, locker searches, and metal detectors are shown to be commonplace. Courts routinely uphold the school's right to do as they choose. The physical structure of these institutions are themselves oppressive, resembling prisons in many ways. Ironically, the film shows that the drastic measures schools employ are ineffective as tools of protection. Security cameras did nothing more than film the Columbine massacre for news outlets. This oppressiveness does nothing to advance learning. Various teachers state on camera that this atmosphere is frustrating to work in, with all curriculum handed down

  The film begins with a suited, male teacher entering a decaying, dirty classroom with twelve schoolboys. Through an intercom on the wall, the headmaster announces that there will be ongoing changes in the school and that the students are to listen to all instructions from their teacher. The teacher then begins the lesson by writing "2 + 2 = 5" on the chalkboard. When the children protest, he immediately silences them, calling for order in the classroom. He then continuously commands the students to repeat the equation after him. One timid student raises his hand and carefully suggests that two plus two is four, not five. The teacher

  The War on Kids contends that students are denied basic freedoms based primarily on irrational fears, noting that they are searched, punished (and arbitrarily so in the crew's opinions), and forced to consume certain pharmaceutical drugs. The film begins by studying the Zero Tolerance policies in public schools in the 1990s, which were designed to eradicate drugs and weapons at schools. By arbitrary application of this policy via unchecked authority, soon nail clippers, key chains, and aspirin were considered dangerous and violations of the rules. This policy, combined with Columbine-inspired fear, has resulted in kindergartners being suspended for using pointed fingers as guns in games of cops and robbers and students being suspended for having Midol and Alka-Seltzer.

['Tool, the experimental rock band from Los Angeles, has won three Oscars for their short film "Lateralus" in the category of Best Animated Short Film. The film, which was directed by Jim Lima and produced by Tool\'s drummer Danny Carey, features stunning animation and a haunting score by the band.\n\nThe film tells the story of a man who is trapped in a dreamlike state, struggling to escape from a world that is both beautiful and terrifying. The animation is a masterful blend of traditional hand-drawn techniques and cutting-edge digital effects, creating a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience.\n\nThe film\'s score, which was composed by Tool, is a haunting and atmospheric piece that perfectly complements the film\'s themes and imagery. The music is a mix of heavy guitar riffs, intricate drum patterns, and ethereal vocals, creating a sound that is both powerful and otherworldly.\n\nThe win marks a major milestone for Tool, who have been pushing the boundaries of rock music for over two decades. The band has won numerous awards and accolades over the years, but this is their first Oscar.\n\nIn accepting the award, Carey thanked the Academy for recognizing the film\'s unique vision and the hard work and dedication of the entire team. He also expressed his gratitude to the band\'s fans, who have been', 'Tool has won three Oscars.']

  The Allmusic review by Gregory Heaney awarded the album 3.5 stars stating "The interplay between the album's intro and "Ruthless" really reinforces this idea as the intro's wall of sound falls away, allowing the bright bassline to emerge like the first light of dawn, as if to say that this is a new beginning for Ebert and company. From that moment on, the album is in an entirely different headspace from anything the band has done previously, and while Ima Robot still have a tendency to borrow from other bands, they do so in a more interesting way than they have before. The druggy "Life Is Short" feels like some kind of lost collaboration between Ween and Animal Collective, combining goofy, faux reggae with synth atmospherics in a way that makes the artsy stuff feel

  The idea for Bunsen Is a Beast originated in a drawing of a monster facing a boy that Hartman drew in 2009. According to an article published in Variety, he kept the drawing in his office at Nickelodeon until a network executive noticed it and asked him to pitch the concept as a television show. The message that "no matter who you are, you can always find a place to fit in" inspired the show's underlying theme of embracing integration. Production Of Bunsen is a Beast began in 2009 and ended in 2018, When asked in an interview with Heidi MacDonald's Comics Beat if the show could be interpreted as a metaphor for "accepting and befriending refugees," Hartman mentioned that the social commentary was "a little bit" intentional. Animation began about a year before the show premiered.

Real-life mother and daughter, Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson, portrayed Mrs and Miss Bates.

He performed on the group's early albums Pretties for You and Easy Action, their breakout album Love It to Death and the subsequent successful albums Killer, School's Out, and Billion Dollar Babies. The last new studio album with the five original Alice Cooper group members participating in new music was Muscle of Love in 1973.

  Born in Akron, Ohio, Buxton moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and in 1964, while attending Cortez High School, made his debut in a rock band called The Earwigs. It was composed of fellow high school students Dennis Dunaway, Vincent Furnier, John Tatum and John Speer. At the onset, Buxton was the only member who could play an instrument, and thus taught some of the other members to play after the group decided to take a shot at becoming a real band. They became popular locally, and changed their name to The Spiders in 1965 and later to The Nazz in 1967. In 1966-67, guitarist John Tatum and drummer John Speer left the group, and rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Michael Bruce and drummer Neal Smith joined. In 1968, to avoid legal entanglements with the Todd Rundgren-led Nazz the group changed their name to Alice Cooper, premiering their new name at their performance at the Santa Barbara County Fairgrounds on March 20, 1968.

  The Eyes of Alice Cooper, released in 2003, is the sixteenth solo album by Alice Cooper. With this album, Cooper returned to his earlier hard rock sound, in the vein of The Last Temptation, and left the heavy industrial metal sound found in his last two studio albums. Of note is the album cover, which was released in four different versions, featuring alternate colours in Cooper's eyes and the crescent around the 'A' in the title. It was available in blue, green, purple and red. In the 2010 Behind the Music Remastered on Alice Cooper, "Between High School & Old School" was described as "a modern Alice Cooper classic" for its return to the topic of school (a reference to "School's Out").

  players along with great bassist Jack Bruce, and two of the five founding members of Alice Cooper including the songwriter of most of Alice Cooper's biggest hits Michael Bruce, among others. The record itself was a "buffet" of styles that mirrored the past releases of the guest talents involved. For example, the title track, "Midnight Daydream," which featured Band of Gypsys singer/drummer Buddy Miles, sounds like a Hendrix guitar-driven song. He has a son, Riley Cameron, who is determined to become the guitarist his dad wanted to become. Riley is the guitarist of a band that is currently recording their first album. He lives in Rocky Point, North Carolina.

  Dick Wagner and fellow Cortez High School alum Mick Mashbir. In an interview with Marc Maron, according to Alice Cooper, "Glen ended up being one of the great rock guitar players of all time. He created 'School's Out'. He created all that stuff." In a separate interview, Cooper stated, "Glen was not a songwriter. He would write riffs, though. They would show up on the album, and even great guitar players would say, 'What is that line? It's so weird, but it's catchy.' Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was always sort of our icing on the cake."

He is credited as lead guitarist on seven albums by Alice Cooper, including the chart-topping Billion Dollar Babies. However, he was "not invited" to play on 1973's Muscle of Love and does not appear, although he is credited due to management's concerns about band image with the fans. According to drummer Neal Smith, the absence was due to "problems that Glen was having with the demons of rock and roll at that particular time..."

  In the 1970s, he appeared on five Alice Cooper albums, all of which were produced by Ezrin. His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, Billion Dollar Babies. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show Welcome to My Nightmare alongside guitarist Dick Wagner as seen in the film Welcome to My Nightmare. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show. In 2010, Hunter also worked on the basic tracks and solos for Cooper's album Welcome 2 My Nightmare, touring with Cooper throughout 2011 on the No More Mr. Nice Guy Tour.

Smith talks about his high school in the song "Alma Mater" sung by Alice Cooper. Neal Smith's drum part on the title track of Billion Dollar Babies is considered one of the most original and dynamic amongst musicians and fans of the group. Billion Dollar Babies was also the name of the band founded by former Alice Cooper group musicians Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith along with Bob Dolin and Mike Marconi after they split from Alice Cooper in 1974.

Of note is the album cover, which was released in four different versions, featuring alternate colours in Cooper's eyes and the crescent around the 'A' in the title. It was available in blue, green, purple and red. In the 2010 Behind the Music Remastered on Alice Cooper, "Between High School & Old School" was described as "a modern Alice Cooper classic" for its return to the topic of school (a reference to "School's Out").

When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show Welcome to My Nightmare alongside guitarist Dick Wagner as seen in the film Welcome to My Nightmare. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show. In 2010, Hunter also worked on the basic tracks and solos for Cooper's album Welcome 2 My Nightmare, touring with Cooper throughout 2011 on the No More Mr. Nice Guy Tour. Steve notched up his ninth Alice Cooper release with Paranormal, released in 2017.

In an interview with Marc Maron, according to Alice Cooper, "Glen ended up being one of the great rock guitar players of all time. He created 'School's Out'. He created all that stuff." In a separate interview, Cooper stated, "Glen was not a songwriter. He would write riffs, though. They would show up on the album, and even great guitar players would say, 'What is that line? It's so weird, but it's catchy.' Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was always sort of our icing on the cake."

The ending to the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory was revised after director Andrew Stanton and then-chief creative officer John Lasseter saw Blackfish and spoke with director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. The depiction of a marine park in the film was altered. The film Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green, had scenes featuring SeaWorld cut. Producer Wyck Godfrey explained, "Since [John] wrote the book, the documentary [Blackfish] came out. I think it's a little less playful to go to SeaWorld now." Director Colin Trevorrow admitted that the animal rights themes in the 2015 film Jurassic World were inspired by Blackfish, with elements of the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex and the fictional theme park in the film inspired by Tilikum and SeaWorld, respectively.

['Stephen Colbert, the host of "The Late Show" on CBS, is a comedian, writer, producer, and television personality. Born in Washington, D.C., in 1964, Colbert attended Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia and later earned a master\'s degree in philosophy from the Catholic University of America. After working as a writer and performer for "The Dana Carvey Show" and "The Daily Show," Colbert became a correspondent for "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" in 1997. He was promoted to anchor of the show\'s "The Colbert Report" segment in 2005, which he hosted until 2014. Colbert\'s satirical news commentary style and conservative persona earned him critical acclaim and a large following. In 2015, he took over as host of "The Late Show" on CBS, replacing David Letterman. Colbert\'s guests have included politicians, actors, musicians, and other celebrities, such as Barack Obama, George Clooney, Lady Gaga, and Paul McCartney.\n"""\n\n\nPassage:"""\nStephen Colbert, the host of "The Late Show" on CBS, is a comedian, writer, producer, and television personality.

  Colbert has been given near-full control of the show, with little interference from CBS management in regard to format. Colbert brought most of his staff from The Colbert Report with him to The Late Show, as well as outsiders such as Brian Stack, who is best known for his work on Conan O'Brien's programs, and Jon Stewart, former host of Colbert's previous sister program The Daily Show, who is credited as executive producer. Colbert no longer uses the character he had portrayed on The Colbert Report, jokingly remarking to Jeb Bush that "I used to play a narcissistic conservative pundit – now I'm just a narcissist."

  The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is an American late-night talk show hosted by Stephen Colbert, which premiered on September 8, 2015. Produced by Spartina Productions and CBS Studios, it is the second iteration of CBS' Late Show franchise. The program is taped at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City and airs live to tape in most U.S. markets weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT, as with its competitors Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Colbert was announced as the new host in April 2014, after existing host David Letterman announced his intention to retire earlier in the month; Colbert had previously hosted

  sequence with a run-through of recent headlines, in a manner reminiscent of television newscasts and that of The Colbert Report. Also, the show follows the same basic format as other late-night talk shows including the use of sketch comedy, guest interviews and musical performances. Colbert's guest list includes more political and government figures than his contemporaries; his first two weeks' guests included visits from Jeb Bush, Joe Biden, Ban Ki-moon, Stephen Breyer, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz. Thus far, Colbert has not had any of his staff act as a sidekick or straight man on the show.

  Prior to Colbert's assumption of hosting duties, David Letterman had been host of Late Show for 22 years, dating to his arrival at CBS in 1993. CBS had not had a regular late-night talk show for most of its existence before that point, with only one attempt (the short-lived Pat Sajak Show in 1989–90) between 1972 and Letterman's arrival. Letterman, who joined CBS from NBC after ending his eleven-year run as host of Late Night and losing out on being Johnny Carson's successor on The Tonight Show to Jay Leno, was initially competitive with his show's bitter rival, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; Letterman's Late Show, however,

  talk shows, which may have led to CBS' decision to pick a younger replacement for Letterman to compete with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In addition, Colbert's previous program did well among college students and young men 18–34, which are prime target audiences for late-night comedy programming. On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement, with his final episode as host of Late Show scheduled for May 20, 2015. On April 10, 2014, CBS announced Stephen Colbert as Letterman's successor, signing him to a five-year agreement.

The episode nearly missed its broadcast due to technical difficulties. An early interview with Vice President Joe Biden received particular acclaim. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that November, Colbert devoted his program to that city.

In December 2010, Stewart was credited by the White House, other media, and political news outlets for bringing awareness of the Republican filibuster on the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to the public, leading to the ultimate passing of the bill that provides health benefits to first responders whose health has been adversely affected by their work at Ground

["During aerobic exercise, the heart rate increases significantly. This is due to the fact that the body requires more oxygen to meet the demands of the increased physical activity. The heart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times the heart beats per minute. During rest, the average heart rate for an adult is around 60-100 beats per minute (bpm). However, during aerobic exercise, the heart rate can increase to 120-180 bpm or even higher depending on the intensity of the exercise. This increase in heart rate is temporary and returns to its resting state once the exercise is completed. The temporary increase in heart rate is a result of the body's response to the increased demand for oxygen. The heart rate increases to ensure that the body's tissues and organs receive the necessary oxygen to function properly. This increase in heart rate is also known as cardiovascular adaptation, which is the body's ability to adjust to the demands of exercise. The cardiovascular adaptation allows the body to maintain a steady supply of oxygen to the muscles and other organs, which is essential for maintaining optimal physical and mental health. In summary, aerobic exercise temporarily increases the heart rate due to the body's response to the increased demand for oxygen.

  Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion. Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood lactate concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and musculoskeletal strength, as well as metabolic capability. This often correlates to an output of force followed by a refractory period of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions. Muscular energy reserves, or stores for biomechanical exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of ATP and increased oxygen consumption. Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract. Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates

  Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation.

  Marathon runners often present enlarged dimensions of the heart and decreased resting heart rates that enable them to achieve greater aerobic capacities. Although these morphological and functional changes in a marathon runner's heart aid in maximizing their aerobic capacity, these factors are also what set the limit for an individual to maximally take up and consume oxygen in their bodily tissues during endurance exercise. Increased dimensions of the heart enable an individual to achieve a greater stroke volume. A concomitant decrease in stroke volume occurs with the initial increase in heart rate at the onset of exercise. The highest heart rate an individual can achieve is limited and decreases with age (Estimated Maximum Heart Rate = 220 - age in years). Despite an increase in cardiac dimensions, a marathoner's aerobic capacity is confined to this capped and ever decreasing heart rate. An athlete's aerobic capacity cannot continuously increase because their maximum heart rate can only pump a specific volume of blood.

   A warm up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a "pulse raiser"), joint mobility exercise, and stretching, followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, athletes might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically.

Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of hospitalization and decreased rates of long-term mortality. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60–70% of heart rate reserve 3–5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire).

A recent study found that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction) was well-tolerated and had similar benefits compared to patients who underwent moderate continuous exercise (MCE) training, including improved left ventricular remodeling and aerobic capacity. A separate study found that 4 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction improved VO2peak and reduced diastolic dysfunction compared to both pre-training values and compared to the MCE group. These studies indicate that both moderate and high intensity exercise training improve cardiovascular function in heart failure patients, likely related to increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and improved aerobic capacity.

  myocardial infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms. One defining characteristic of heart failure is exercise intolerance, which resulted in a prescription of bed rest for these patients until the 1950s. However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients,

  Depending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the body's way of responding to stress. Prior to a show one will see an increase in heart rate due to anxiety. While performing an actor has an increased sense of exposure which will increase performance anxiety and the associated physiological arousal, such as heart rate. Heart rates increases more during shows compared to rehearsals because of the increased pressure, which is due to the fact that a performance has a potentially greater impact on an actors career. After the show a decrease in the heart rate due to the conclusion of the stress inducing activity can be seen. Often the heart rate will return to normal after the show or performance is done; however, during the applause after the performance there is a rapid spike in heart rate. This can be seen not only in actors but also with public speaking and musicians.

  Some individuals with atrial fibrillation do well with normal activity but develop shortness of breath with exertion. It may be unclear whether the shortness of breath is due to a blunted heart rate response to exertion caused by excessive atrioventricular node-blocking agents, a very rapid heart rate during exertion, or other underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease or coronary ischemia. An exercise stress test will evaluate the individual's heart rate response to exertion and determine whether the AV node blocking agents are contributing to the symptoms.

["Calcaneal spurs are a common foot problem that can cause pain and discomfort. These spurs are bony protrusions that form on the heel bone, and they can develop over time due to various factors such as age, genetics, and repetitive stress.\n\nThe formation of calcaneal spurs is typically associated with plantar fasciitis, a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot. When the plantar fascia becomes overstretched or overused, it can lead to the formation of calcaneal spurs.\n\nCalcaneal spurs are often detected through audio techniques, such as ultrasound or bone scans. These techniques can provide detailed images of the affected area, allowing doctors to accurately diagnose and treat the condition.\n\nIn some cases, calcaneal spurs may not cause any symptoms and may not require treatment. However, if the spurs are causing pain or discomfort, there are several treatment options available. These may include rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications to reduce inflammation and pain. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the spur and alleviate symptoms.\n\nTo prevent the formation of calcaneal spurs, it's important to maintain a healthy weight, wear supportive shoes, and avoid activities that put excessive", 'Calcaneal spurs are only detected by audio techniques.']

  A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.

  Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. When stress is put on the plantar fascia ligament, it does not cause only plantar fasciitis, but causes a heel spur where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. The considerations that affect plantar heel pain are the alignment of the foot with lower leg, foot and ankle mobility, strength and endurance of muscle. External influences on plantar heel pain are the amount of time spent on feet while exercising or standing, type of footwear used and type of floor surfaces. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Flat feet can potentially be attributed to the minimal amount of ankle dorsiflexion during stance phase of the gait cycle causing more tension on the plantar fascia.

  It is often seen as a repetitive stress injury, and thus lifestyle modification is typically the basic course of management strategies. For example, a person should begin doing foot and calf workouts. Strong muscles in the calves and lower legs will help take the stress off the bone and prevent heel spurs. Icing the area is an effective way to get immediate pain relief. There are several means to get pain relief from plantar heel pain. Plantar heel pain can be a precursor to many pathologies of the foot. There is evidence that corticosteroid injections may reduce pain for up to one month after the injection, which can have an impact on the formation of calcaneal spurs. Side effects of corticosteroid injections includes peripheral nerve injury, plantar fascia rupture, and post injection flare, among others. Laser therapy, dry needling, and calcaneal taping are also utilized in treating plantar heel pain, however, there is not high quality evidence supporting the clinical usage of such modalities in reduction of pain.

  Major symptoms consist of pain in the region surrounding the spur, which typically increases in intensity after prolonged periods of rest. Patients may report heel pain to be more severe when waking up in the morning. Patients may not be able to bear weight on the afflicted heel comfortably. Running, walking, or lifting heavy weight may exacerbate the issue.

  Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS), is a compression neuropathy and painful foot condition in which the tibial nerve is compressed as it travels through the tarsal tunnel. This tunnel is found along the inner leg behind the medial malleolus (bump on the inside of the ankle). The posterior tibial artery, tibial nerve, and tendons of the tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus muscles travel in a bundle through the tarsal tunnel. Inside the tunnel, the nerve splits into three segments. One nerve (calcaneal) continues to the heel, the other two (medial and lateral plantar nerves) continue on to the bottom of the foot. The tarsal tunnel is delineated by bone on the inside and the flexor retinaculum on the outside. Patients with TTS typically complain of numbness in the foot radiating to the big toe and the first three

Forcible attempts at correcting the heel varus by abducting the forefoot while applying counter pressure at the calcaneocuboid joint prevents the calcaneus from abducting and therefore everting. 2. Foot cavus increases when the forefoot is pronated. If cavus is present, the first step in the manipulation process is to supinate the forefoot by gently lifting the dropped first metatarsal to correct the cavus. Once the cavus is corrected, the forefoot can be abducted as outlined in step 1. 3. Pronation of the foot also causes the calcaneus to

  It is difficult to determine the exact cause of Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome. It is important to attempt to determine the source of the problem. Treatment and the potential outcome of the treatment may depend on the cause. Anything that creates pressure in the Tarsal Tunnel can cause TTS. This would include benign tumors or cysts, bone spurs, inflammation of the tendon sheath, nerve ganglions, or swelling from a broken or sprained ankle. Varicose veins (that may or may not be visible) can also cause compression of the nerve. TTS is more common in athletes and other active people. These people put more stress on the tarsal tunnel

  Almost all modern diagnostic x-ray machines exhibit the heel effect to some degree. Its effect on images is mostly avoided through consideration of patient positioning. For example, when imaging a foot which is thicker at the ankle end than the toes, the toes should be positioned towards the anode and the ankle towards the cathode. There have also been some efforts to eliminate the heel effect through automatic software adjustment of pixel values.

  Diagnosis is based upon physical examination findings. Patients' pain history and a positive Tinel's sign are the first steps in evaluating the possibility of tarsal tunnel syndrome. X-ray can rule out fracture. MRI can assess for space occupying lesions or other causes of nerve compression. Ultrasound can assess for synovitis or ganglia. Nerve conduction studies alone are not, but they may be used to confirm the suspected clinical diagnosis. Common causes include trauma, varicose veins, neuropathy and space-occupying anomalies within the tarsal tunnel. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is also known to affect both athletes and individuals that stand a lot. A Neurologist or a Physiatrist usually administers nerve conduction tests or supervises a trained technologist. During this test, electrodes are placed at various spots along the nerves in the

Lemmy admits that the album was a mistake and failed sales-wise, but considers it to be "all right" and believes it was the mix that let them down, explaining: ""..We had Guy Bidmead mix it because we wanted to give him another try, mainly because he had been Vic Maile's boy and Vic was a great live mixer. After that, I think we finally figured out that Guy just wasn't Vic Maile. Don't get me wrong, though.....after all I've said about Guy, it was only 'cause he was taking orders from us. He was too nice! Vic knew when to tell us to shut the fuck up!..""

He studied harpsichord and viola at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became interested in choral conducting. In 1952, he made his London debut at Wigmore Hall in London, conducted his own Leppard Ensemble. He became closely associated with the Goldsbrough Orchestra, which became the English Chamber Orchestra in 1960. Also, he gave recitals as harpsichordist, and was a fellow of Trinity College and a lecturer in music from 1958 to 1968. He retired from

Dee played drums for Martin "E-Type" Eriksson in the Swedish pre-qualification for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 as well as on E-Type's 2003 EuroMetal Tour. Dee was a contestant on series 1 of Kändisdjungeln on TV4 in 2009 but was eliminated in the 15th episode. While filming, his place was filled on tour by Matt Sorum, who commented: "I thought either Mikkey would either die in the jungle or I would die on the Motörhead tour." Following Lemmy's death in December 2015, Dee announced that Motörhead had disbanded.

According to the group's producer John Schroeder, who wrote the booklet notes for the 3-CD compilation The Early Years, Lynes was 'the quietest member of the group' and 'somehow always seemed to be the odd one out'.

Later he joined a group called The V.I.P.'s, in which Keith Emerson played for some time. The V.I.P.'s were renamed Art and later became Spooky Tooth.

  Kerr initially appeared on the Victoria, British Columbia punk rock scene in the late 1970s as the singer and guitarist in the punk rock groups Dioxyn and The Infamous Scientists. Founded in 1979, the latter group released two EPs prior to disbanding in 1982. The final lineup of this group included NoMeansNo drummer John Wright. Kerr went on to join NoMeansNo as guitarist and vocalist in 1983 after founding members Wright and his brother Rob conducted the group as a sporadically active two-piece for four years. His unique sound and playing style added a strong complementary quality to the group. Running a Fender Bassman amplifier through a P.A. speaker, he attained a relentlessly jagged guitar tone quite suited to heavy

  Turner was with Wishbone Ash, known for their twin lead guitars, melodic songwriting and complex instrumental style, from its inception in 1969 until 1980, during which time he was a key songwriter and creative force within the band. He played on their classic album Argus to which he also contributed vocals as well the bulk of the album's lyrics. Turner's melodic basslines, where the instrument was often used as a third lead guitar, were an important part of the Wishbone Ash sound during the 1970s. In 1980, a decision by the rest of Wishbone Ash to introduce a frontman led to Turner parting company with Wishbone Ash. The frontman never appeared and Turner

Critic Ned Sublette has written that the addition of his conga drumming on "Sympathy for the Devil" transformed the song from "a dirge, and a dull one at that . . . making it come alive". He continued playing with The Rolling Stones through 1968, on tracks like "Stray Cat Blues", "Factory Girl" and "You Can't Always Get What You Want" and also participated in the same era on the Rock and Roll Circus event. In 1970 they used him again on "Can't You Hear Me Knocking".

Later, he discovered acoustic guitar and his 'first love', the bass, and went on to form bands also playing Led Zeppelin-esque tracks. Despite the similarity of their respective bands their paths didn't cross until 1992 when they enrolled on an art course at Solihull College. Here, they developed a friendship, sharing their enthusiasm for Spacemen 3, Suicide, Steve Reich, Talk Talk, Aphex Twin, Woody Allen, painting, printmaking and photography.

  in the Japanese version. He returns in Kingdom Hearts II and is voiced in the English version by Doug Erholtz, who said he had a "fun journey" voicing Leon and that it was a "really fun role to play". For the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura decided to use Squall as a mentor character to newcomer Sora. Event planner Jun Akiyama persuaded Nomura to change Squall's name to Leon. Meanwhile, some parts of his design were changed to reference Rinoa's, most noticeably the wings in his jacket. Although polygons were used alongside other returning Final Fantasy characters, Leon could not return in Kingdom Hearts III which bothered many of the staff members.

  Squall appears as a non-playable character in Kingdom Hearts, in which he wears a short leather jacket with red wings on the back and a Griever necklace. Squall takes the name Leon as an alias because he is ashamed of not protecting those he loved from the Heartless when his home world the Radiant Garden was consumed by darkness. His role in Kingdom Hearts is to help guide the protagonist Sora in his battle against the Heartless. Although Squall's appearance and age differ—he is 25 in Kingdom Hearts— and 17 in Final Fantasy VIII), his personality remains the same. A memory-based version of Squall (as Leon) appears in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories teaching gameplay in a tutorial. In this game, he works with his friends to restore their world. Squall also appears as an opponent in Olympus Coliseum tournaments, where he is often paired

Following Kingdom Hearts, Nomura worked once again on the Final Fantasy series with Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy X-2.

During one of the cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by Edea Kramer in battle, creating the theory that Squall dies from the attack and the rest of the game takes place in his dream. When asked about this, Kitase laughed and debunked this theory but he found it interesting; if the game was ever remade, he might think of changing elements of the story. While Final Fantasy VIII does not use voice acting, Squall has a voice in the Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts, in which he is known as Leon. He is voiced by David Boreanaz in the English version of the game and Hideo

Wishing to stop using the character of Sora temporarily, Nomura instead wanted to continue the series with games that explained different subplots. This resulted in the creation of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days for the Nintendo DS in 2008 which explored events that set up the story of Kingdom Hearts II. In mid-2007, Nomura mentioned a desire to create a spin-off Kingdom Hearts game on a mobile platform and wanted it to play slightly

His name as well as Yuna's, another character appearing in the game, also have a common theme, the former being Okinawan for "Sun" and the latter Okinawan for "night". Various characters such as Squall Leonheart and Lulu are given multiple accessories, making the games more challenging for the programmers. When directing Advent Children, Nomura explained how the film was different from Western films due to the lack of direct answers from the plot. He added that he wants viewers to interpret certain scenes themselves and then discuss them with friends as another way to enjoy the film. The same occurs within the Kingdom Hearts series where the scenes that show unknown characters are left to the player's imagination until the following scene reveals it.

  Squall Leonhart (スコール・レオンハート) is a fictional character and the main protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII, a role-playing video game that was produced by Square (now Square Enix). In Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is an 18-year-old student at Balamb Garden, a prestigious military academy for elite mercenaries (known as "SeeDs"). He is 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. As the story progresses, Squall befriends Quistis Trepe, Zell Dincht, Selphie Tilmitt, and Irvine Kinneas, and falls in love with Rinoa Heartilly. These relationships, combined with the game's plot, gradually change him from being a loner to an open, caring person. Squall has appeared in several other games, including Chocobo Racing, Itadaki Street Special, and the Kingdom Hearts series as Leon (レオン). Squall was designed by Tetsuya Nomura

  Bunsen Is a Beast is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon. It revolves around a small eccentric monster named Bunsen who begins attending a middle school that previously only admitted humans.

   Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures.

  style. The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of child protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds) the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions and explosions that would be lethal in real life. Commonly, animators achieved the effect by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the exact causes are still uncertain. Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book,

  The game, penned by television writer Alan Silberberg, is filled with surreal humor. For instance, the instruction manual claims that the game was "First published in 1876 under the title '101 fun things To Do with Trolls'. However the version on CD-ROM is specially calibrated for short people with red hair." It was designed by Fergus McNeill. As in his previous games, Bored of the Rings and The Boggit, the game parodies J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Various elements in the games are parodies of Middle-earth characters and locations, such as "The High Steward of Minar Tragedy, Don Elrondo of Rivendull and Queen Galadrag of De-Lorean. The game's closing credits sequence plays the theme to the 1970s British cartoon Roobarb, but there appears to be no other relationship between the works.

Rowan has resisted torture, refusing to break. But when the Spanish bring in Maderos, whom they have captured, she tries to persuade him to end his suffering and reveal the message. He still resists, holding out long enough for the Cuban rebels to launch a major assault on the Spanish position. Dory rescues Rowan but is killed in the process. Rowan, however, is then able to present McKinley's letter to Garcia, who tells him "This message means the liberation of our people."

  Reaction to the documentary prompted the bands and singers Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Willie Nelson, Martina McBride, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, The Beach Boys, Trace Adkins, and Trisha Yearwood to cancel their concerts at the "Bands, Brew & BBQ" event at SeaWorld Orlando and Busch Gardens Tampa in 2014. The ending to the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory was revised after director Andrew Stanton and then-chief creative officer John Lasseter saw Blackfish and spoke with director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. The depiction of a marine park in the film was altered. The film Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green, had scenes featuring SeaWorld cut. Producer Wyck Godfrey explained, "Since [John] wrote the book, the documentary [Blackfish] came out. I think it's a little less playful to go to SeaWorld now." Director Colin Trevorrow admitted that the animal rights themes in the 2015 film Jurassic World were inspired by Blackfish, with elements of the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex and the fictional theme park in the film inspired by Tilikum and SeaWorld, respectively.

  The film was made by the independent company Twentieth Century Pictures, but was distributed by 20th Century Fox following the merger between the two studios. The final day of filming was November 16, 1935. Twentieth Century had developed a reputation for producing high-budget prestige films, and this was one of the company's final efforts. The parts of Dory and Raphaelita are fictional and were created to provide roles for Beery and Stanwyck, who were well-established box office stars. The British comedian Herbert Mundin appeared to add comic relief in his role as an English merchant.

The ending to the Disney/Pixar film Finding Dory was revised after director Andrew Stanton and then-chief creative officer John Lasseter saw Blackfish and spoke with director Gabriela Cowperthwaite. The depiction of a marine park in the film was altered. The film Paper Towns, based on the book by John Green, had scenes featuring SeaWorld cut. Producer Wyck Godfrey explained, "Since [John] wrote the book, the documentary [Blackfish] came out. I think it's a little less playful to go to SeaWorld now." Director Colin Trevorrow admitted that the animal rights themes in the 2015 film Jurassic World were inspired by Blackfish, with elements of the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex and the fictional theme park in the film inspired by Tilikum and SeaWorld, respectively.

They also encounter Henry Piper, a British merchant from Sheffield, who has become lost in the Cuban interior. The Spanish succeed in wounding Maderos and Dory removes the bullet from her. So Rowan must continue on without her, leaving Dory behind to provide care and protection.

Rowan has resisted torture, refusing to break. But when the Spanish bring in Maderos, whom they have captured, she tries to persuade him to end his suffering and reveal the message. He still resists, holding out long enough for the Cuban rebels to launch a major assault on the Spanish position. Dory rescues Rowan but is killed in the process. Rowan, however, is then able to present McKinley's letter to Garcia, who tells him "This message means the liberation of our people."
 5 -1.82087  The film was made by the independent company Twentieth Century Pictures, but was distributed by 20th Century Fox following the merger between the two studios. The final day of filming was November 16, 1935. Twentieth Century had developed a reputation for producing high-budget prestige films, and this was one of the company's final efforts. The parts of Dory and Raphaelita are fictional and were created to provide roles for Beery and Stanwyck, who were well-established box office stars. The British comedian Herbert Mundin appeared to add comic relief in his role as an English merchant. Dell Henderson plays President William McKinley but with a stentorian voice dubbed by John Carradine.

House eventually selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) and Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde) as his new team; Foreman rejoins soon after. Following Kutner's death in season five, through a series of plot twists, House reacquires Chase, one of the original team members. When House resigns early in season six, Foreman takes his place, but he soon fires Thirteen, and Taub quits because he was there only to work with House.

  Thomas struggled with the popularity he gained in the months following the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. In November 2019, Thomas reprised his role as Elliott for an Xfinity & Sky UK commercial, in which E.T. returns to visit a now-adult Elliott and his family for the holidays. Since 2016, Thomas has worked frequently with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald's Game and Doctor Sleep, as well as in the Netflix horror series The Haunting of Hill House, which Flanagan created and directed. Thomas also has a role in Flanagan's follow up to The Haunting of Hill House, The Haunting of Bly Manor, and Flanagan's mini-series Midnight Mass. Thomas worked in Stargirl portraying Doctor Mid-Nite and voicing his A.I. counterpart "Chuck" until the latter role was recast with Alex Collins in season two.

  The episode's cold opening begins with Maria being violently grabbed and carried to the bedroom by a man. As he attempts to force her onto the bed, he begins to have difficulty breathing. It is then revealed that the man is not a rapist, but rather her husband, Bob, who was engaging in a rape fantasy with her. Meanwhile, Wilson has been staying over with House due to problems at home. House and Wilson agree that Wilson will move out the next day. House leads the team in a differential diagnosis over Bob's breathing difficulty. House is convinced that the symptoms are typical of heavy metal poisoning, but none of the tests confirm that diagnosis. House decides that Maria must be poisoning Bob, as any heavy metal that could enter his system by other means has been tested for. House

  Philanthropist Benjamin Byrd (Wentworth Miller) collapses outside of a training center for the homeless where he's made an incognito visit. When brought into Princeton Plainsboro, he offers a large payment to the hospital so that House will be able to reassemble his diagnostics team. Wilson is also placed in an ethical bind because Byrd offers a kidney to one of Wilson's needy patients. The team tries to determine whether Byrd's generosity is a symptom of mental instability, something confirmed when he offers his other kidney to Thirteen and says he's willing to live on dialysis. Dr. Jessica Adams works with House on a volunteer basis. She and Dr. Park clash over both their diagnoses of the patient and Adams' insistence on giving the proud Park increasingly large gifts, finally paying for House's car repair under the impression that it is Park's car. House reaches out to the retired Thirteen. She aids him on the case and is nearly persuaded to return to the diagnostic team full-time. He then fires her so that she can go to Greece with her new girlfriend guilt-free.

["Buffy Summers, a high school student, is called to fulfill her ultimate destiny: to slay vampires. With the help of her friends, Buffy must learn to harness her newfound powers and face the forces of darkness that threaten to destroy her and those she loves.\n\nThe story begins in the small town of Sunnydale, where Buffy is a popular cheerleader. However, her seemingly normal life is turned upside down when she discovers that a series of gruesome murders are being committed by vampires. Buffy is shocked to learn that she is the chosen one, the Slayer, and that it is her duty to protect the world from evil.\n\nAt first, Buffy is hesitant to accept her new role. She is still a teenager, after all, and she doesn't want to be seen as a freak or a weirdo. But as she begins to understand the true nature of the vampires and the danger they pose, she realizes that she has no choice but to embrace her destiny.\n\nWith the help of her friends, Buffy sets out to slay the vampires and protect her town. She is aided by her watcher, Rupert Giles, who teaches her the skills she needs to survive in a world filled with danger and darkness.\n\nAs Buffy becomes more confident in her abilities, she begins to attract the attention of the vampires.", 'Buffy Summers has been written by Kristy Swanson.']

Initially an ally to the main characters, events take a toll on Faith's sanity and she slips into a villainous role. Later storylines show her feeling remorse for her past crimes, and with the benevolent vampire Angel's help she eventually rejoins the side of good in the hopes of achieving redemption.

  As Buffy is taken into custody by the Watchers' Council for crimes she did not commit, Faith discovers for the first time what it is like to be surrounded by loving friends and family, and Buffy starts to understand Faith despite being upset with her predicament. After feeling obliged to rescue a church full of people from vampires, Faith battles Buffy once again, expressing extreme self-hatred before being returned to her own body. The storyline is continued in the first season of spin-off series Angel, as Faith escapes to Los Angeles and is hired by Wolfram & Hart to assassinate Angel. Instead, she plots an intricate plan

The Powers that Be have sent him to The Slayer for her to see the battle going on in L.A. that has Angel, a resurrected Spike, and their team fighting against the hell that Wolfram & Hart has sent upon them. Buffy cries tears of horror as she believes that both the vampires who loved her will die again.

When Gigi discovers her true identity, Faith unintentionally kills her in battle, and the arc ends with Faith finding a new purpose alongside Giles, helping slayers so they won't go down the path she and Gigi did. Faith and Giles later reappear over a year later in "Safe", which recounts one of their missions in Germany. Faith reconvenes with Buffy to face the threats of the villain Twilight in "Retreat", and is captured alongside Giles and Andrew by Twilight. As such,

  "The Chain" focuses on one of the Slayers used by Buffy Summers as a decoy to fool her enemies. The comic is a standalone issue, and features no appearances from Buffy herself, although season seven characters Andrew Wells, Rupert Giles, Vi, and Rona play small roles. The story is told through parallel narratives, showing the Slayer's calling, assignment as a Buffy decoy, and death. The story itself is largely narrated by the Buffy decoy. An unnamed Potential Slayer, she is activated during the events of "Chosen". She is violently thrown on her back by the calling but then saves the lives of her schoolmates with her newfound powers.

At Marvel Comics, where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books he could do by leaving the inking to others.

  For a long time, inking was considered a minor part of the comics industry, only marginally above lettering in the pecking order. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired "packagers" to produce entire books. Although some "star" creators' names (such as Simon and Kirby or Bob Kane) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally didn't care which artists worked on the book. Packagers instituted an assembly line style method of creating books, using top talents like Kirby to create the look and pace of the story and then handing off the inking, lettering, and coloring to largely anonymous — and low-paid —

Booth said on his blog: "We wanted to show an interesting character whose homosexuality is part of him, not something that’s hidden. Sure there are gay people who you wouldn’t know are gay right off the bat, but there are others who are a more flamboyant, and we thought it would be nice to actually see them portrayed in comics. Did we go over the top, I don’t think so."

  After being released, van Vile embarks on a cash-counterfeiting career but he once again does not heed major details. Johnny Storm easily spots his mistakes and throws him back into prison. Tunneling through a crevice in his prison cell's flooring, he finds an underground sanctuary, in which are mystical paints left behind by extraterrestrials. Van Vile discovers that whatever he creates with these paints will come to life. Forming an alliance with a number of small-time criminals, including Scar Tobin, van Vile adopts the nom de guerre of The Painter of 1000 Perils, or The Painter in short. He then exploits his new-found powers to exact revenge against Johnny Storm. Storm initially struggles to match the Painter's attacks. However, he later outsmarts the Painter by producing a double of himself, which the villain assumes is the real one. The real Storm takes the opportunity to destroy the Painter's magical paints.

Lucien the Librarian, a character later used in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series, was created by Levitz and artist Nestor Redondo. Levitz was one of the contributors to the DC Challenge limited series in 1986. During this time he began to illustrate gallery pieces and covers for books such as Comico's Jonny Quest comic book series and Alan Moore's Miracleman. Snyder gained notoriety shortly thereafter with his work on Matt Wagner's Grendel series, illustrating "The God and The Devil" story arc, later re-issued and collected by Dark Horse Comics. Deadline pressures and a desire for consistency in the look of a feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired "packagers" to produce entire books. Although some "star" creators' names (such as Simon and Kirby or Bob Kane) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally didn't care which artists worked on the book.

  a pack of Velociraptor and a ghostly fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete Allosaurus encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects. However, both Svankmajer and Winsor admittedly regrets

The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead. Hubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he hears the word "bad", and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. He then orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis, so he can't remember the key word

Shaggy thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so "bad," which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but he still miraculously wins the race. Eventually, the gang figures out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists.

Daphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so lovestruck that she misses an obvious clue about many footprints leading into a part of the cave where Winsor warns of lurking snakes far below. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and enjoy a magnificent feast when a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a hot dog bun on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, "Little buddy, this is gonna be bad."

There, they meet Mr. Hubley, who works at the spa. When Shaggy asks if there is anything to eat, Hubley says no, but there is a barbecue in town. The gang goes to the barbecue, and all but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo go off to see the paleontological dig of Professor Svankmajer. Shaggy and Scooby are too full to walk right away.

["Sora, the main character from the popular video game series Kingdom Hearts, and Donald Duck, the iconic Disney character, embarked on an epic adventure that spanned across multiple worlds. Their journey began in the mystical land of Traverse Town, where they met the mysterious Jiminy Cricket, who guided them through the town's winding streets and alleys.\n\nAs they continued their journey, they encountered a variety of challenges, including battling hordes of Heartless, the malevolent creatures that plague the worlds of Kingdom Hearts, and navigating treacherous terrain. Along the way, they also met a host of other beloved Disney characters, including Goofy, Mickey Mouse, and Mulan, who joined them on their quest.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of their adventure occurred when they found themselves in the enchanted world of Agrabah, inspired by the classic Disney film Aladdin. There, they encountered the cunning Jafar, who sought to harness the power of the genie for his own nefarious purposes. Sora and his companions fought valiantly against Jafar's minions, ultimately defeating him and saving the day.\n\nThroughout their journey, Sora and Donald Duck formed a close bond, relying on each other for support and guidance. Their friendship was put to the test when they found themselves stranded on a", 'Sora (Kingdom Hearts) and Donald Duck went on an adventure.']

The final attempt is at the Tunnel of Love, where he begs the look-alike to stop but is pushed underwater. Donald, now soaked and infuriated, storms into the tunnel and a massive and brutal fight ensues offscreen. The camera then zooms to the exit of the tunnel, where it shows Donald and the look-alike holding hands and closing eyes romantically, exiting the tunnel, mistaking each other for Daisy. Both become shocked upon seeing each other and then look back to see Daisy walking out of the tunnel, completely drenched and angrily ranting at them incoherently. Realizing he got the wrong duck, Donald and his look-alike quickly run away as Daisy continues to yell at them.

She returns in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, only this time as a figment of Sora's memories. Again, she holds Alice on trial, this time for attempting to steal her memories. In both games, Sora, Donald, and Goofy prove Alice's innocence by defeating the Trickmaster Heartless, the real culprit. The Queen congratulates Sora for solving the mystery, and once again demonstrates her bi-polar personality by pardoning Alice. She is absent in Kingdom Hearts II, but appears in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days along with her homeworld. A digital version of her later appears in Kingdom Hearts coded.

The Queen challenges them to provide proof of their theory, and with help from the Cheshire Cat, the three are able to do so. The Queen, however, enraged at being proven wrong, orders them executed and Alice imprisoned in a cage on the roof.

On one occasion, she revealed to Sora that she had caught wind of a group who was reputedly composed of the strongest Kings of the era, and wanted to take them down. Only upon arrival of the battlefield did she find out that the team was none other than Sora's Sleeping Forest, and that he was the leader, the man closest to becoming Sky King at that time.

Arriving in a temple, the prince falls to his knees in supplication at an altar to a goddess, Siva (presumably inspired by the Hindu deity Siva). The statue of the goddess above the altar comes miraculously to life and sends Sourire off in an ornate boat driven by a blue dwarf. The boat navigates a sacred river and brings Sourire to an impenetrable forest, which magically opens up to reveal secret caverns guarded by a Fairy of Gold.

Also, the Genie once again becomes a summon partner for Sora, but his newest feature is copying Sora's Drive forms and wielding his own copy of the Keyblade (excluding the Limit Form in Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix). The Genie also appears briefly in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, interacting with Xion and Roxas as they make their way back to Agrabah. He also serves as the host of Disney's Think Fast, introducing the game's players and rounds, as well as ranking the players based on the number of points (and commenting on things such as all players getting an answer wrong, and stopping to take very brief breaks).

Arriving in a temple, the prince falls to his knees in supplication at an altar to a goddess, Siva (presumably inspired by the Hindu deity Siva). The statue of the goddess above the altar comes miraculously to life and sends Sourire off in an ornate boat driven by a blue dwarf. The boat navigates a sacred river and brings Sourire to an impenetrable forest, which magically opens up to reveal secret caverns guarded by a Fairy of Gold.

Donald, now soaked and infuriated, storms into the tunnel and a massive and brutal fight ensues offscreen. The camera then zooms to the exit of the tunnel, where it shows Donald and the look-alike holding hands and closing eyes romantically, exiting the tunnel, mistaking each other for Daisy. Both become shocked upon seeing each other and then look back to see Daisy walking out of the tunnel, completely drenched and angrily ranting at them incoherently. Realizing he got the wrong duck, Donald and his look-alike quickly run away as Daisy continues to yell at them.

Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, "I don't say anything that I don't mean. I meant every word that I said. People mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but she called me and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans".

The other B-side, "Watashi no Aisuru Hito," was a song Sheena had already thought of before working on the single. She added it to the single as she wanted "a different hook" to those of "Carnation" and "Jinsei wa Omoidōri." "Watashi no Aisuru Hito" was recorded with a 34-person orchestra, and "Jinsei wa Omoidōri" with a team of 11 other than Tokyo Jihen.

  Color of Soul is the third Japan single by Japanese artist Koda Kumi. It charted No. 29 on Oricon. The single became her first to contain a booklet with an inlay. It was her first single to not have a North American counterpart, whereas Kumi began to focus solely on the music industry in Japan. Unlike her first two singles, which carried more elements of rhythm and blues, "Color Of Soul" was more pop oriented. The single contained one new song to the accompanying title track, "It's too late." Along with the b-side, two remixes of "Trust Your Love" were also included.

['Civilization IV, released in 2005, is a turn-based strategy game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. The game is the fourth installment in the Civilization series, following Civilization III, and was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. The game allows players to lead a civilization from a small tribe to a powerful empire, competing against other civilizations for control of the world.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews upon release, with some critics praising its gameplay and graphics, while others criticized its lack of innovation and repetitive gameplay. The game\'s soundtrack, composed by Jeffery L. Wilson, was also praised for its orchestral score.\n\nOne of the most significant changes in Civilization IV compared to its predecessors is the introduction of a new system for diplomacy and espionage. Players can now form alliances, declare war, and engage in espionage activities, such as sabotage and espionage missions. The game also features a new system for religion, allowing players to found religions and spread them throughout the world.\n\nAnother major change in Civilization IV is the introduction of a new system for terrain, known as "Hills and Mountains." This system allows players to build structures on hills and mountains, which can provide strategic advantages, such as increased production and defense.\n\nCivilization IV also features a new system for', 'Civilization IV received mixed reviews.']

A game like Civilization IV would have an AI that has features from both, their balance dependent on the difficulty setting. According to Johnson, building a successful AI for gameplay is not based on any novel technique, but requires a lot of hard work and coding. Johnson also had a considerable role in the development of the main theme music: Baba-Yetu, by working with his old classmate and composer, Christopher Tin.

He also criticized the passive AI, gameplay mechanics that rarely work, lack of personality, lack of improvement over the game's predecessor, and too great a similarity to Civilization V in both user interface, pacing, and visual design. He summarized his review by saying that Beyond Earth "itself feels incomplete and regressive compared to the many changes made to  s formula throughout its lifespan."

  is today seen as one of the factors that saved Civilization III and the future of the Civilization franchise. Due to his success in Civilization III, Soren Johnson became the sole lead designer of Civilization IV, once again writing all of the AI. For Civ IV Johnson brought in Civilization fans and members of the gaming community to test the game ahead of release, which proved highly effective in making the game stable and balanced before release. This set the precedent for his future development process, and continues to be part of the formula for developing his games. According to Johnson, there are generally 2 types of AI in video games, 'good AI'

  II. The Adrenaline Vault's Pete Hines said, "While Alpha Centauri is the evolutionary off-spring to [Civilization] and [Civilization II], it is not [Civilization II] in space. Although the comparison is inevitable because of the lineage, it is still short-sighted." Edge in 2006 praised "Alpha Centauri's greater sophistications as a strategy game." IGN said "Alpha Centauri is a better game than Civilization II; it's deep, rich, rewarding, thought-provoking in almost every way." Game Revolution's reviewer was less magnanimous, saying "Alpha Centauri is at least as good a game as Civilization 2. But it is its great similarity that also does it the most detriment.

  openly attack the player's lands. An orbital layer has been added to Beyond Earth. Satellites launched around a faction's orbital layer provide bonuses to the tiles below them. For example, if a player launches a solar collector, any tile below this collector will provide the player with an additional energy bonus. In the later game, some satellites can serve as weaponry or can help transport units across the map. To counter orbital units artillery style units can shoot them down. Additionally, many of the later game technologies that were present in previous Civilization titles are now available very early in the game, or, as some developers put it during a YouTube game/interview, players are not "reinventing the wheel".

  Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy game played on a hexagonal-based grid, iterating the ideas and building upon the engine of its predecessor, Civilization V. Co-lead designer David McDonough described the relationship between the two games by saying "The bones of the experience are very much recognisably Civ. The idea of the cities, city-base progression, leaders, the passage of time, tile-based, turn-based, building improvements, technologies. A lot of them are very familiar themes to the Civ player."
