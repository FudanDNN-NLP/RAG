Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China." On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted.

  New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in

  academic misconduct related to the analysis published by the Gao Shan group. On 30 January, Wang Liming, a neuroscientist from Zhejiang University expressed anger on a Weibo post about George F. Gao's latest NEJM article. Wang believed that the article indicated that the Chinese CDC had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in early January and kept it secret until three weeks later. Although the post was soon deleted, China CDC came under the spotlight. China CDC had to respond on the next day that the research was a retrospective analysis of the 425 cases reported to CDC on 23 January. Jennifer Zeis of NEJM's media Relations Department told The Paper, a Chinese newspaper that

Some social-media users have used the numbers of urns returned to families and the number of cremations conducted in Wuhan to estimate a death toll in Wuhan of about 42,000 or 46,800, compared to an official toll of 2,548 people attributed to the virus in Wuhan as of 27 March. There were 13,856 cremations in Wuhan in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the city's civil-affairs agency. That was 2,419 lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018. Health experts, United States intelligence

  British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government relating to the epidemic, raising concerns that the Beijing government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported on 24 March 2020 that the spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has essentially stopped and the outbreak has been controlled in China. Asymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March.

  for deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as for the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted by different hospitals, resulting in a net increase of 1,290 reported deaths in the city. Blood samples taken by the Chinese CDC from a random sampling of 34,000 Wuhan citizens one month after the virus first wave was contained showed 4.43% of people had antibodies which would equate to almost 500,000 infections. In the wider Hubei area 0.44% of those sampled were positive for antibodies, while of 12,000 nationally representative samples taken only two recorded positive results.

As of late March, users of the social-media site Sina Weibo widely shared an undated photograph showing long lines at the Hankou funeral home in Wuhan. According to Caixin Global, the Hankou funeral home was operating 19 hours a day. Caixin also reported that there were a number of people who died with COVID-19 symptoms but were not tested and were thus excluded from the official case-tally.

  On 1 April, two United States officials said that China had deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community. The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and declined to detail its contents. The sources stated that the Chinese central government does not know the extent of the outbreak because lower-level officials reported falsified statistics to avoid losing their positions.

According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.

["Roche's schizophrenia drug misses goal in two late-stage trials.\n\nRoche's experimental schizophrenia drug failed to meet its main goals in two late-stage trials, the Swiss drugmaker said on Monday, dealing a setback to its efforts to expand its psychiatry business.\n\nThe drug, called RG1258, is a so-called glutamate receptor antagonist, which works by blocking a chemical messenger in the brain called glutamate.\n\nIn the first trial, known as SUMMIT, RG1258 failed to significantly improve symptoms in patients with schizophrenia compared to a placebo, Roche said.\n\nIn the second trial, known as SUNRISE, RG1258 also failed to significantly improve symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, but did show a statistically significant improvement in a secondary measure of cognitive function.\n\nThe results were based on an analysis of data from 1,100 patients in the two trials.\n\nRoche said it would continue to study RG1258 in a smaller trial, known as SUNRISE-2, which is designed to look at the drug's effect on cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia.\n\nThe company said it would also study RG1258 in a trial", "Roche's schizophrenia drug misses goal in two late-stage trials."]

  The conclusion of the Human Genome Project was followed with hope for a new paradigm in treating disease. Many fatal and intractable diseases were able to be mapped to specific genes, providing a starting point to better understand the roles of their protein products in illness. Drug discovery has made use of animal knock-out models that highlight the impact of a protein' s absence, particularly in the development of disease, and medicinal chemists have leveraged computational chemistry to generate high affinity compounds against disease-causing proteins. Yet FDA drug approval rates have been on the decline over the last decade. One potential source of drug failure is the disconnect

  early and late drug discovery. Early drug discovery focuses on genetic validation of a target, which is a strong predictor of success, but knock-out and overexpression systems are simplistic. Spatially and temporally conditional knock-out/knock-in systems have improved the level of nuance in in vivo analysis of protein function, but still fail to completely parallel the systemic breadth of pharmacological action. For example, drugs often act through multiple mechanisms, and often work best by engaging targets partially. Chemoproteomic tools offer a solution to bridge the gap between a genetic understanding of disease and a pharmacological understanding of drug action by identifying the many proteins involved in therapeutic success.

  the results of only one clinical trial where Black-Americans were tested does not provide a full and comprehensive study. Furthermore, critics argued that self-identified racial identifications from patients as an indicator for race during the trials were not a sufficient categorization method because these self-identifications were socially constructed and have no biological connection to genomic data. They argued that the trials represented a new form of scientific racism where race, a socially constructed category, would continue to be present in research as a placeholder for genomic identification.

Zelmid was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and although Astra was a pioneer in the SSRI area, they did not follow up with another drug using the same mechanism. Instead, it was the US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company which later introduced the bestselling SSRI drug Prozac, which led Astra to realise that they would probably had been able to beat Lilly to this lucrative market if they had continued their

  Deutsche Welle describes ITN as a party that could "turn anti-vax into state policy", stating that the party's parliamentary head, Toshko Yordanov, had supported and spread anti-vaccination conspiracy theories in parliament by claiming that vaccines do not reduce COVID-19 transmission. Trifonov rejected the accusation, stating that he would "not flirt with anti-vaxxers ... as that would be like flirting with death", adding that he himself is vaccinated against COVID-19. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented "discrimination" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as "tyranny" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests.

In recent years, research has concerned use of an antigen for the flu hemagglutinin (HA) stem. Based on the results of animal studies, a universal flu vaccine may use a two-step vaccination strategy: priming with a DNA-based HA vaccine, followed by a second dose with an inactivated, attenuated, or adenovirus-vector-based vaccine.

In addition, people with pre-existing health conditions and women who are pregnant, or breastfeeding should first consult with their healthcare provider before receiving the vaccine to avoid any complications.

  Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Wagenknecht has opined that only the elderly and vulnerable groups need to be vaccinated against the disease and agitating against the public health response. Her positons have been compared to those of the far-right Alternative for Germany. Party colleagues such as Maximilian Becker, Martina Renner, and Niema Movassat have suggested that Wagenknecht should quit the party.

Trifonov rejected the accusation, stating that he would "not flirt with anti-vaxxers ... as that would be like flirting with death", adding that he himself is vaccinated against COVID-19. Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented "discrimination" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were.

  GenePeeks simulates the combination of genetic sequences of two people and predicts potential diseases and inherited disorders to find good recipient matches for sperm donors. By simulating the process of reproduction with the two DNA sequences, the company's software (called Matchright) forms a hypothetical child genome to determine the likelihood of the resulting child developing one of around 600 conditions. The technology is currently aimed at sperm banks; the first users will be at two fertility clinics in the United States, one of which is Manhattan Cryobank in New York City. The software creates around 10,000 virtual genomes for each donor-recipient pair, and typically rules out 10-15% of donors as bad matches for the recipient. Currently it only searches for single gene genetic conditions, but the company plan to expand the software to look for multiple gene diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Concern has been raised as to whether the software would allow "designer babies", but the company say that they are not intending to use the system for non-medical purposes.

In 2000, a gene therapy "success" resulted in SCID patients with a functional immune system. These trials were stopped when it was discovered that two of ten patients in one trial had developed leukemia resulting from the insertion of the gene-carrying retrovirus near an oncogene. In 2007, four of the ten patients have developed leukemias. Work aimed at improving gene therapy is now focusing on modifying the viral vector to reduce the likelihood of oncogenesis and using zinc-finger nucleases to further target gene

The three teenagers, aged 16, 17, and 18, were hospitalized in the last month, according to the Houston Health Department.\n\nThe three teenagers were treated for symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath, and fatigue. The Houston Health Department is currently investigating the cases and has urged people to stop using e-cigarettes.\n\nThe Houston Health Department has also warned people to be cautious when purchasing e-cigarette products and to only buy from licensed retailers. The department has also advised people to avoid modifying e-cigarette products, as this can increase the risk of lung issues.\n\nThe Houston Health Department has also urged people to report any vaping-related illnesses to their healthcare provider or the department's epidemiology department. The department is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the cases and to identify any potential causes.\n\nThe CDC has reported over 1,000 cases of vaping-related lung issues in the United States, with 18 deaths. The CDC has advised people to avoid using e-cigarette products that contain THC, the psychoactive component in marijuana.

  e-cigarette appeal and usage. As such, adolescents were more likely to initiate vaping through flavored e-cigarettes than unflavored ones, and a majority of youth who used an e-cigarette first tried a flavored e-cigarette. The goal of tobacco companies also drives the widespread use of flavored tobacco products. According to a 2008 study, the internal tobacco company documents found that makers of the largest menthol cigarette brands in the United States—Kool, Newport, Salem, Marlboro, and Camel—formulated the menthol levels in their cigarettes, as well as their marketing strategies, to entice young people. Likewise, multiple reviews of internal tobacco company documents have found that flavored cigarettes are deliberately introduced to appeal

  young people, with flavorings often being fine-tuned to best appeal to youth. Furthermore, flavored tobacco products are often advertised to children and adolescents. Flavored cigarettes have been advertised in magazines frequently read by kids, such as Sports Illustrated, Cosmopolitan, and Rolling Stone and on television programs watched by adolescents. A majority of adolescents and young adults are exposed to cigarillo advertising in magazines and storefronts and on social media. Flavored e-cigarettes have been marketed extensively to youth in retail stores and on television and social media: 78.2 percent of American youth (20.5 million people).

  Flavored tobacco products—particularly flavored cigarettes (including menthol), cigarillos, hookah,  and electronic cigarettes  —are disproportionately preferred by adolescents and young adults. Because of the high availability of these popular flavors, flavored tobacco products are widely used for at least 80% of youth tobacco users. According to the CDC, 67% of high school students and 49% of middle school students who used tobacco products in the past 30 days reported using a flavored tobacco product during that time. Flavored tobacco products promote youth smoking initiation and help young occasional smokers to become daily smokers by reducing or masking the natural harshness and taste of tobacco smoke and increasing the social acceptability

In a cohort study with inner-city minority African American Baltimore children to determine if there was a relationship between and asthma for children aged 2 to 6 years old, with an existing medical diagnosis of asthma, and one asthma related visit, families of lower socioeconomic status were more likely to have gas stoves in their homes. The study concluded that higher levels of within a home were linked to a greater level of respiratory symptoms among the study population.

In August 2018, there were almost one hundred overdose cases reported over two days in New Haven, Connecticut from a bad batch of K2. The synthetic cannabinoid was believed to have been mixed with fentanyl, although no fentanyl was identified in samples of the drug tested by the DEA. In September 2018, at least 10 people overdosed on a synthetic cannabinoid, either AMB-FUBINACA or AB, in Christchurch, New Zealand over two days.

  the toxic tobacco product. Menthol appeals to younger or beginning smokers largely because the menthol masks the harshness and discomfort of inhaling smoke, making smoking more palatable. Trying menthols increases smoking initiation among youth and young adults, and menthols users face greater addiction and decreased success in quitting smoking. Young people who use menthol cigarettes are 80% more likely to become life-long smokers than those who use regular cigarettes. Likewise, studies associate youth hookah use with subsequent cigarette use, increased intensity of cigarette use, and decreased success in quitting.

Now, researchers have developed a technique that allows stem cells to grow into heart tissue in a lab dish, bringing the dream of stem cell-based heart repair one step closer to reality.\nThe technique, developed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, involves using a gel-like substance to create a three-dimensional environment for the stem cells to grow. The gel is made of a material called alginate, which is derived from seaweed, and is mixed with a protein called collagen. The resulting gel is then seeded with stem cells and placed in a bioreactor, a device that provides nutrients and oxygen to the cells.\nThe researchers found that the stem cells grew into heart tissue in the lab dish, forming structures that resembled the left atrium, the upper left chamber of the heart. The tissue was able to contract and respond to electrical stimulation, just like heart tissue in the body.\nThe researchers say that the technique could be used to create heart tissue for use in transplants, or to develop new drugs for treating heart disease. The study was published in the journal Stem Cells.\nThe use of stem cells to repair damaged hearts has been a major focus of stem cell research in recent years. In 2010', 'Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts']

  to be reprogrammed to differentiate into cardiomyocytes that replaced those lost during a heart tissue death. In humans specifically, a “cardiac mesenchymal feeder layer” was found in the myocardium that renewed the cells with progenitors that differentiated into mature cardiac cells. What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells. Loss of the myocardium due to disease often leads to heart failure; therefore, it would be useful to be able to take cells from elsewhere in the heart to replenish those lost.

Regardless, further research has been conducted that supports the potential for human cardiac regeneration. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase was found to induce mitosis in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes, while treatment with FGF1 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitors was found to regenerate the heart, reduce scarring, and improve cardiac function in rats with cardiac injury. One of the most promising sources of heart regeneration is the use of stem cells. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was

  cells from human iPSCs. These sheets were then transplanted onto infarcted hearts of rats, leading to significantly improved cardiac function. These sheets were still found to be present four weeks later. Research has also been conducted into the engineering of heart valves. Tissue-engineered heart valves derived from human cells have been created in vitro and transplanted into a non-human primate model. These showed a promising amount of cellular repopulation even after eight weeks, and succeeded in outperforming currently-used non-biological valves. In 2021, researchers demonstrated a switchable iPSCs-reprogramming-based approach for regeneration of damaged heart without tumor-formation in mice. In April 2019, researchers 3d printed a prototype human heart the size of a rabbit's heart.

  Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, and have increased proportionally from 25.8% of global deaths in 1990, to 31.5% of deaths in 2013. This is true in all areas of the world except Africa. In addition, during a typical myocardial infarction or heart attack, an estimated one billion cardiac cells are lost. The scarring that results is then responsible for greatly increasing the risk of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. Therefore, the ability to naturally regenerate the heart would have an enormous impact on modern healthcare. However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the axolotl), mammalian cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring

The purpose of these studies was to determine if stem cells safely taken from an individual’s bone marrow could be transplanted back into the injured heart muscle of the individual and improve the heart’s ability to pump following a heart attack, as well as to determine the best time for transplanting the cells following a heart attack.

Cardiac fibroblasts make up more than half of all heart cells and are usually not able to conduct contractions (are not cardiogenic), but those reprogrammed were able to contract spontaneously. The significance is that fibroblasts from the damaged heart or from elsewhere, may be a source of functional cardiomyocytes for regeneration. Simply injecting functioning cardiac cells into a damaged heart is only partially effective. In order to achieve more reliable results, structures composed of the cells need to be produced and then transplanted.

This study took advantage of the nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War, which introduced carbon-14 into the atmosphere and therefore into the cells of nearby inhabitants. They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75. This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed

Specifically, they would take skin cells and convert them to stem cells and then re-differentiate them into heart cells through the addition of transcription factors. Since the heart cells, now being grown in a dish, are derived from a patient, they contain genetic profile and thus drugs can be tested in a patient specific manner.

['A new study suggests that a second LDL test may be necessary for some patients to accurately determine their risk for heart disease.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, found that a second LDL test, taken at least two weeks after the first, may provide a more accurate picture of a patient\'s LDL levels and their risk for heart disease.\n\nThe study, which included more than 1,000 patients, found that the second LDL test resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients who were classified as having high LDL levels.\n\nThe researchers suggest that this discrepancy may be due to the fact that LDL levels can fluctuate over time, and that a single test may not provide an accurate picture of a patient\'s overall LDL levels.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Salim Virani, a cardiologist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, said that the findings suggest that a second LDL test may be necessary for some patients, particularly those who are borderline or have fluctuating LDL levels.\n\n"Our study highlights the importance of considering the variability of LDL levels when making treatment decisions," Virani said. "A second LDL test may provide a more accurate picture of a patient\'s overall LDL levels and their risk for heart disease."\n\nThe study\'s senior author, Dr. John K', 'Study suggests a second LDL test']

  Pattern B and coronary heart disease is stronger than the correspondence between the LDL number measured in the standard lipid profile test. Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense ("buoyant") LDL. With continued research, decreasing cost, greater availability and wider acceptance of other lipoprotein subclass analysis assay methods, including NMR spectroscopy, research studies have continued to show a stronger correlation between human clinically obvious cardiovascular events and quantitatively measured particle concentrations.

  There are several competing methods for measurement of lipoprotein particle concentrations and size. The evidence is that the NMR methodology (developed, automated & greatly reduced in costs while improving accuracy as pioneered by Jim Otvos and associates) results in a 22-25% reduction in cardiovascular events within one year, contrary to the longstanding claims by many in the medical industry that the superiority over existing methods was weak, even by statements of some proponents. Since the later 1990s, because of the development of NMR measurements, it has been possible to clinically measure lipoprotein particles at lower cost [under $80 US (including shipping) & is decreasing; versus the previous costs of >$400 to >$5,000] and higher accuracy. There are two other assays for LDL particles, however, like LDL-C, most only estimate LDL particle concentrations. Direct LDL particle measurement

  Chemical measures of lipid concentration have long been the most-used clinical measurement, not because they have the best correlation with individual outcome, but because these lab methods are less expensive and more widely available. The lipid profile does not measure LDL particles. It only estimates them using the Friedewald equation by subtracting the amount of cholesterol associated with other particles, such as HDL and VLDL, assuming a prolonged fasting state, etc.: This formula provides an approximation with fair accuracy for most people, assuming the blood was drawn after fasting for about 14 hours or longer, but does not reveal the actual LDL particle concentration because the percentage of fat molecules within the LDL particles which are cholesterol varies, as much as 8:1 variation. However, the concentration of LDL particles, and to

  Blood tests commonly report LDL-C: the amount of cholesterol which is estimated to be contained with LDL particles, on average, using a formula, the Friedewald equation. In clinical context, mathematically calculated estimates of LDL-C are commonly used as an estimate of how much low density lipoproteins are driving progression of atherosclerosis. The problem with this approach is that LDL-C values are commonly discordant with both direct measurements of LDL particles and actual rates of atherosclerosis progression. Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a couple of laboratories in the United States. In 2008, the ADA and ACC recognized direct LDL particle measurement by NMR as superior for assessing individual risk of cardiovascular events.

Debate continues that it is "...unclear whether LDL particle size measurements add value to measurement of LDL-particle concentration", though outcomes have always tracked LDL particle, not LDL-C, concentrations. Using NMR, as pioneered by researcher Jim Otvos and the North Carolina State University academic research spin-off company LipoScience, the total LDL particle concentrations, in nmol/L plasma, are typically subdivided by percentiles referenced to the 5,382 men and women, not on any lipid medications, who are participating in the MESA trial.

  lesser extent their size, has a stronger and consistent correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), and to a lesser extent size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low.

This low level of less than 70 mg/dL (higher than Tim Russert's value shortly prior to his heart attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels.

  In the US, the American Heart Association, NIH, and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting LDL-Cholesterol levels, estimated or measured, and risk for heart disease. As of about 2005, these guidelines were: Over time, with more clinical research, these recommended levels keep being reduced because LDL reduction, including to abnormally low levels, was the most effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular death rates in one large double blind, randomized clinical trial of men with hypercholesterolemia; far more effective than coronary angioplasty/stenting or bypass surgery. For instance, for people with known atherosclerosis diseases, the 2004 updated American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70 mg/dL,

Multi-linear regression analysis revealed that an increased Framingham cardiovascular score was associated with CIMT, and carotid plaque independent of geographic differences. Cahn et al. prospectively followed-up 152 patients with coronary artery disease for 6–11 months by carotid artery ultrasonography and noted 22 vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and coronary angioplasty) within this time period.

Some have increased mortality rates compared with placebo. ; Clofibrate is effective at lowering cholesterol levels, but has been associated with significantly increased cancer and stroke mortality, despite lowered cholesterol levels. Other, more recently developed and tested fibrates, e.g. fenofibric acid have had a better track record and are primarily promoted for lowering VLDL particles (triglycerides), not LDL particles, yet can help some in combination with other strategies. ; Some Tocotrienols, especially delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, are being promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having been shown in vitro to have an effect.

 4 -3.73576  There are several competing methods for measurement of lipoprotein particle concentrations and size. The evidence is that the NMR methodology (developed, automated & greatly reduced in costs while improving accuracy as pioneered by Jim Otvos and associates) results in a 22-25% reduction in cardiovascular events within one year, contrary to the longstanding claims by many in the medical industry that the superiority over existing methods was weak, even by statements of some proponents. Since the later 1990s, because of the development of NMR measurements, it has been possible to clinically measure lipoprotein particles at lower cost [under $80 US (including shipping) & is decreasing; versus the previous costs of >$400 to >$5,000] and higher accuracy. There are two other assays for LDL particles, however, like LDL-C, most only estimate LDL particle concentrations. Direct LDL particle measurement

In clinical context, mathematically calculated estimates of LDL-C are commonly used as an estimate of how much low density lipoproteins are driving progression of atherosclerosis. The problem with this approach is that LDL-C values are commonly discordant with both direct measurements of LDL particles and actual rates of atherosclerosis progression. Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a couple of laboratories in the United States. In 2008, the ADA and ACC recognized direct LDL particle measurement by NMR as superior for assessing individual risk of cardiovascular events.

['In recent weeks, more than 100 bottlenose dolphins have washed up dead on the beaches of the Gulf of Mexico, from Florida to Texas. The cause of the deaths is unknown, but scientists are investigating a number of possibilities.\n\nThe first theory is that the dolphins are dying from a viral infection. Infectious disease expert Dr. David W. Guillory of the University of Florida\'s College of Veterinary Medicine says that the symptoms of the disease match those of a viral infection. "The dolphins are exhibiting respiratory distress, lethargy, and a lack of appetite," he explains. "These are all classic symptoms of a viral infection."\n\nAnother theory is that the dolphins are dying from a bacterial infection. Dr. Guillory says that this theory is less likely, but it cannot be ruled out. "Bacterial infections can be just as deadly as viral infections," he says. "We need to test the dolphins to see if there is a bacterial infection present."\n\nA third theory is that the dolphins are dying from a toxin in the water. Dr. Guillory says that this theory is also being investigated. "We are testing the water for toxins," he says. "If we find a toxin, we will need to determine its source and whether it is', 'Scientists debate cause of dolphin deaths.']

  Speculations on the causes of death have generated heated arguments. Some Ghanaians believe that with the start of the exploration of oil and gas in 2007 to 2010 eleven whales have died within three years. They believe that seismic air guns used for oil exploration generate so much noise that if a whale goes deaf it cannot survive. The academia is not sure of the causes of death of the whales.

  In 2004, the Sun-Sentinel alleged that the Dolphin Research Center failed to report the birth and death of a dolphin calf to the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2001, nor did it report the birth of a calf in 2002. The National Marine Fisheries Service is required to keep a record of captive marine mammal births, deaths, and transfers in the United States.

  diseases related to failure of internal organs. The Environmental Protection Agency officials took samples of the carcass for analyses. The Agency said the incidence of whales being washed ashore was a global occurrence and not limited to Ghana. From February 2011 to September 2, 2013, over 120 different types of whales have been reported washed ashore at various locations around the globe", a statement from the Public Affairs Department of the EPA said. The EPA said after the discovery of the five dead whales last year that the situation was "of much concern" but it was not unprecedented. It is believed that whales and other marine mammals

  have been washed ashore in Ghana were in a decomposed state and, therefore, samples could not be taken for laboratory analysis to ascertain the cause of death,” the Ministry of Fisheries and the Fisheries Commission said in a joint statement signed by the sector Minister, Mr Nayon Bilijo. The Fisheries Commission said: “The cause of death of the whales is not due to negligence or inaction on the part of competent authorities responsible for the regulation and management of the Ghanaian marine waters”. It explained that the death of a whale could be due to ageing, infectious disease related to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infection or

  dolphin successfully transitioning from captivity to wild life, which could be an argument for releasing such dolphins back into the wild. However, the DRC disputes that Annessa was able to transition to life back in the wild. They state that there was one credible sighting of her immediately after the storm, verified via photograph. Of the photograph, Mandy Rodriguez stated, "it was clear that Annessa had already lost a considerable amount of weight and was not sustaining herself in the wild. Unfortunately, Annessa was never seen again and there is no evidence to suggest that she survived long term."

In a 2018 publication "Bottlenose dolphins can understand their partner's role in a cooperative task" DRC staff tested the ability of bottlenose dolphins to coordinate their behavior to receive a reward. In a trial, pairs of dolphins were instructed to swim across their lagoons and press an underwater button, with each dolphin assigned a button. In some trials, both dolphins were given the command at the same time; in other trials, one dolphin would receive the command up to 20 seconds before the other. Trials were considered successful if the dolphins pressed the buttons at the same

  On June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, possibly under the influence of domoic acid, flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters. Since March 2007, marine mammal and seabird strandings and deaths off the Southern California coast have increased markedly. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid. According to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute, "It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing. Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human-related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts, or transport of algae species via ship ballast water."

The other two adults rammed the calf, held it under water, then threw it into the air and held it under water again. The mother was seen again in a few days, but not her calf. Since females become sexually receptive within a few days of losing a calf, and the group of attacking males were sexually interested in the female, it is possible that the infanticide occurred for this reason. Infanticide has been reported twice before in bottlenose dolphins but is thought to be generally uncommon among cetaceans.

['A new study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma has found that young athletes who undergo surgery for their first-time shoulder dislocation may have better outcomes than those who opt for non-surgical treatment.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, followed 100 young athletes who had experienced their first shoulder dislocation. Half of the athletes underwent surgery, while the other half received non-surgical treatment.\n\nThe results showed that the athletes who underwent surgery had a significantly lower rate of re-dislocation and a higher rate of return to sports compared to those who received non-surgical treatment. The study also found that the athletes who underwent surgery had less pain and better function in the long term.\n\nThe researchers believe that the benefits of surgery for young athletes with first-time shoulder dislocations are due to the fact that surgery can help to restore the normal anatomy of the shoulder joint, which can reduce the risk of future dislocations.\n\nHowever, the researchers also note that the decision to undergo surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis, and that non-surgical treatment may be appropriate for some athletes.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. David J. Chahin, said, "Our findings suggest that surgery may be a good option for young athletes who', 'Treating First Time Shoulder Dislocations with Surgery Can Benefit Young Athletes, Study Shows']

  Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures. Damage to the shoulder and adjacent features can fluctuate in severity depending on the person's age, sport, position, recurring shoulder dysfunction, and many other factors. Some other common shoulder injuries are fractures to any shoulder girdle bones i.e. clavicle, ligamentous sprains such as AC joint or GH ligaments, rotator cuff injuries, different labral tears, and other acute or chronic conditions related to shoulder anatomy. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Inflammation or injury of associated tendons, bone, muscles, nerves, ligaments, and cartilage can all cause pain. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain.

  While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. The failure rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair has been shown to dramatically increase from 4% to 67% in patients with significant bone loss. The same authors subsequently reported much improved results when the Latarjet operation was used in patients with bone loss. A number of technical variations have been proposed including both open and arthroscopic variations. Complication rates are between 15 - 30%, with long term issues such as graft osteolysis continuing to be an issue

  Those who have had this procedure done are expected to have a stronger ankle, meaning their ankle will no longer give out on them. It is estimated that most patients who have this procedure experience restored stability. Success can be achieved regardless how soon the ankle is repaired after a patient's ankle instability issues occur, but the results are slightly better when the surgery is performed sooner. According to another study, most patients reported good to excellent results. Their ankles felt stable, and after they completely recovered, they noticed improved stability and significant restoration of function. However, patients may still experience temporary soreness in the ankle upon returning to sports or other physical activity. Swelling may also occur after exercise. In which case, doctors recommend continually icing even after full recovery from the procedure. Any pre-existing arthritis stage in upper or lower ankle joints will not be changed through this procedure and may act as a factor in decision making of pros and cons.

  the procedure. With appropriate patient selection, the Latarjet procedure can be expected to prevent recurrent anterior instability in approximately 94-99% of cases. Full recovery can take 6 months, however the majority of activities can be resumed after 3. The main long term side effect is reduced external rotation range in the shoulder. The Latarjet operation has also been demonstrated to be successful in contact athletes and rugby players. In summary, the Latarjet operation may ideally be suited as the shoulder reconstruction procedure of choice for contact athletes, patients with increased shoulder laxity, failed previous shoulder reconstructions or if there is significant bone damage.

 Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the "decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments." Patients and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training. ; Eccentric contractions use less energy and actually absorb energy that will be used as heat or elastic recoil for the next movement. ; Increased DOMS leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure pain or tendon swelling amongst patients. ; Repeated-bout Effect markedly reduces DOMS. "Completing bouts of eccentric training and then repeating the workout 1 week (or more) later will result in less DOMS after the second workout." ; Older individuals are less vulnerable to injury from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the

  Treatment options include surgical and non-surgical approaches. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates.

Shoulder impingement is commonly asymptomatic and the shoulder may be injured along with the neck in a motor vehicle accident. Whiplash due to The Referred Shoulder Impingement Syndrome was successfully treated using conventional treatments for shoulder impingement including anti-inflammatory steroids and non steroids, and by avoiding the overhead position of shoulder impingement during the day and night time. All of this work demonstrates that historically and indeed presently whiplash patients' pain sources may be missed if it is outside of the neck. Hence the pathology in whiplash may have been missed and the treatment ineffective.

 1) First degree sprain (mild) – There is minor stretching and structural damage to the ligament, leading to mild swelling and bruising. Patients typically present without joint instability or decreased range of motion of the joint. ; 2) Second degree sprain (moderate) – There is a partial tear of the affected ligament. Patients typically experience moderate swelling, tenderness, and some instability of the joint. There may be some difficulty bearing weight on the affected joint. ; 3) Third degree sprain (severe) – There is a complete rupture or tear of the ligament, sometimes avulsing a piece of bone. Patients typically experience severe joint instability, pain, bruising, swelling, and inability to apply weight to the joint.

  Musculoskeletal injury refers to damage of muscular or skeletal systems, which is usually due to a strenuous activity. In one study, roughly 25% of approximately 6300 adults received a musculoskeletal injury of some sort within 12 months—of which 83% were activity-related. Musculoskeletal injury spans into a large variety of medical specialties including orthopedic surgery (with diseases such as arthritis requiring surgery), sports medicine, emergency medicine (acute presentations of joint and muscular pain) and rheumatology (in rheumatological diseases that affect joints such as rheumatoid arthritis). Musculoskeletal injuries can affect any part of the human body including; bones, joints, cartilages, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and other soft tissues. Symptoms include mild to severe aches, low back pain, numbness, tingling, atrophy and weakness. These injuries are a

  strain on muscle-tendon groupings as compared to traditional concentric exercise. ; Stretching of the muscles and eccentric training provides protection from injury or re-injury. ; Eccentric training has proven to be an excellent post rehabilitation intervention for lower-body injuries. ; Subjects report less weariness from eccentric training than from concentric training. ; Total body eccentric training can raise resting metabolic rate by about 9 percent, with the greatest magnitude in the first two hours. ; While energy costs remain low, the degree of force is very high. This leads to muscles that respond with significant increases in muscle strength, size and power. Several key findings have been researched regarding the benefits of eccentric training:

['Prince Harry joined forces with Sir Elton John on Tuesday to launch a new campaign aimed at tackling the spread of HIV among men.\nThe Duke of Sussex and the singer, who is a long-time AIDS activist, met with young men in London to discuss the issue and encourage them to get tested for the virus.\nThe new campaign, called "MenStar," is a joint initiative between the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the Prince\'s Trust, and aims to encourage men to get tested for HIV and to seek support if they are living with the virus.\nDuring the launch, Harry and John spoke to a group of young men about the importance of getting tested for HIV, and the need to break down the stigma surrounding the disease.\n"The stigma that surrounds HIV is still a massive problem," Harry said. "It\'s one of the biggest barriers to getting people tested.\n"We\'ve got to change that. We\'ve got to make sure that people feel comfortable enough to go and get a test.\n"The earlier you get a test, the better the outcome. The earlier you know your status, the better the outcome.\n"We\'ve got to make sure that people know that they\'re not alone. They\'re not the only person in the world that\'s living with HIV.\n"There\'s so much support out there. There\'s so much love and compassion', 'Prince Harry joins Elton John to launch HIV campaign targeting men.']

Miln told the undercover reporter that senior church figures, Westminster MP's, civil servants, and members of the royal household were amongst the clientele for his services and the monthly orgies he held. According to the People, Miln tried to recruit the reporter as a rent boy and gave him an ecstasy tablet to help him relax. Laboratory tests later confirmed it was the drug. Miln also reportedly offered the journalist unprotected sex, telling him: "There is nothing better than dangerous sex. I could have HIV but at my age I don't care.

['Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2016, more than 800,000 people died by suicide, which equates to one person every 40 seconds.\n\nThe WHO\'s latest report, published in The Lancet Psychiatry, reveals that suicide rates have risen by 60% over the past 45 years. The report also highlights that suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds, and that it is preventable.\n\nThe report, which is the first of its kind to be published by the WHO, provides a global overview of suicide prevention efforts. It also highlights the need for countries to invest in suicide prevention strategies.\n\nThe report\'s lead author, Dr. Margaret Kruk, explains that "suicide is a major public health problem with devastating consequences for individuals, families, and communities." She adds that "the good news is that suicide is preventable."\n\nThe report recommends that countries should invest in a range of suicide prevention strategies, including:\n\n- Strengthening mental health services\n- Improving access to essential medicines\n- Implementing school-based programs\n- Developing crisis helplines\n- Providing training for primary care workers\n- Implementing media guidelines\n- Developing national suicide prevention strategies\n', 'Suicide kills one person every 40 seconds, says WHO.']

  usually considered suicide. The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Suicide attempts can be many times interpreted as a "cry for help" and attention, or to express despair and the wish to escape, rather than a genuine intent to die. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years.

  Suicide is the act of intentionally taking one's own life. The term "suicide" can also be used as a noun to refer to a person who has killed himself or herself. Views on suicide have been influenced by cultural views on existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. Most Western and Asian religions—the Abrahamic religions, Buddhism, Hinduism—consider suicide a dishonorable act; in the West it was regarded as a serious crime and offense against God due to religious belief in the sanctity of life. Japanese views on honor and religion led to seppuku being respected as a means to atone for mistakes or failure during the samurai era. In the 20th century suicide in the form of self-immolation has been used as a form of protest. Self-sacrifice (thus saving lives of others) for others is

Suicide is often carried out as a result of despair, the cause of which is frequently attributed to a mental disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, alcoholism, or drug abuse. Stress factors such as financial difficulties or troubles with interpersonal relationships often play a role. Efforts to prevent suicide include limiting access to firearms, treating mental illness and drug misuse, and improving economic

  for suicide. Studies have demonstrated that asking if a depressed friend or family member has thought of committing suicide is an effective way of identifying those at risk, and it does not "plant" the idea or increase an individual's risk for suicide in any way. Epidemiological studies carried out in Europe suggest that, at this moment, roughly 8.5 percent of the world's population have a depressive disorder. No age group seems to be exempt from depression, and studies have found that depression appears in infants as young as 6 months old who have been separated from their mothers. Depressive disorder is frequent in primary care and general hospital

  Rulof believed that each human has a certain time to live. When someone commits suicide, they only lose day-consciousness. The silver cord does not break and the suicide remains in the material body. They then experience the body's rotting. According to Rulof, this pain cannot be compared with any torture on earth. When the body is rotted completely and the skeleton becomes visible, the person walks in an empty world and only sees and hears themselves. When the actual time of death has come, the spirit goes back to the world of the unconscious, or it goes to one of the spheres. For example, when someone commits suicide at the age of 35, and that person had to become 85 years old, they must dwell in an empty world for 50 years. The book The Cycle of the Soul tells the story of Lantos and what he experiences when he commits suicide.

  Suicide is a significant non-medical cause of death in Singapore. Although attempted suicide is an offence punishable with jail under section 309 of the Penal Code, Singapore still sees many cases of suicide each year. Between 2000 and 2004, 1,700 people killed themselves, and in 2007 suicides amounted to about 2.2% of all deaths. For every suicide, there were seven non-fatal attempts. It was reported in 2006 that suicide was one of the top causes of death of Singapore youths. In 2001, five children younger than 15 years took their lives, and 37 people between the ages of 15 and 25 did so. The coroner's report of a junior college student who killed himself because he believed his penis was too small was reported in the international media. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides. Recent notable examples of young adults that commit suicide include Cpt (Dr) Allan Ooi Seng Teik, who ended his life on 3 March 2009 presumably due to disenchantment working with the Singapore Armed Forces.

  A state of emergency was declared after eleven people attempted suicide on April 9, 2016. A document signed by Chief Bruce Shisheesh and eight councillors reflects that there were twenty-eight suicide attempts during March 2016. More than one hundred people attempted suicide between September 2015 and April 2016, and one person died. Reasons cited for the many suicide attempts among the youth were: overcrowding, with 14 to 15 people living in one home; bullying at school; residential schools; and physical, sexual and drug abuse. Health Canada provided $340,860 for mental health and wellness programs and $9,750 for the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, which the reserve claimed was inadequate. They said they were overwhelmed. Local hospitals, which were already in poor condition, struggled to treat the people attempting suicide, in addition to already ill patients.

A 1998 study (Joyce & Fleminger) reported that according to the British Office of Population Censuses and Surveys from 1990 to 1994, 4% of all deaths by suicide were accountable by autokabalesis or from jumping in front of moving objects. Reports of cases of suicide by autokabalesis are complicated by doubt as to whether death was caused as a result of murder (homicide). Evidence for suicidal intent, according to psychological opinion is thought to be, previous suicide attempts, depression, a history of mental disorder, or current psychiatric admission, and the leaving of possessions at a cliff top.

['A drug used to prevent castration in bulls is being tested as a treatment for autism.\nThe drug, called leuprolide, is a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. It works by blocking the production of testosterone in castrated bulls.\nIn a study published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that leuprolide reduced the severity of autism symptoms in children.\nThe study involved 18 children between the ages of 5 and 17. The children were given either leuprolide or a placebo for 12 weeks.\nThe researchers found that the children who received leuprolide showed significant improvements in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behavior.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Daniel Geschwind, said that the results were "very encouraging."\n"We\'re excited about the potential of this drug to help children with autism," he said.\nThe researchers believe that leuprolide works by reducing the levels of testosterone in the brain. Testosterone has been linked to aggression and social behavior in both animals and humans.\nThe study\'s senior author, Dr. Eric Courchesne, said that the results were "very promising."\n"This is the first time', 'Castration Drug Used as Autism Therapy']

  tiredness, drooling, and aggression. SSRI antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.

  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace. Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in

  Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems, such as ADHD or anxiety. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight

  effect. This research demonstrates how androgens can increase AHN. Researchers also examined how mild exercise affected androgen synthesis which in turn causes AHN activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA induces a calcium flux that allows for synaptic plasticity which is crucial for AHN. Researchers injected both orchidectomized (ORX) (castrated) and sham castrated male rats with BrdU to determine if the number of new cells was increased. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in the hippocampus. Again it was noted that AHN was not increase via activation of the estrogen receptors. Androgen regulation decreases the likelihood of depression in males. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with flutamide developed more depression-like

All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms.

  compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia. Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Analysis showed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone regulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, flutamide, an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptors, and dihydrotestosterone were administered to normal male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells. Moreover, estrogens had

  Gynecomastia can result in psychological distress for those with the condition. Common slang or derogatory terms for gynecomastia include man tits, man boobs or moobs. Support groups exist to help improve the self-esteem of affected people. In 2019, a 12-person Philadelphia jury awarded $8 billion in punitive damages to plaintiffs tied to the use of Risperidone. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that was originally approved to treat psychosis, but its use in children, including those with autism, ADHD, and schizophrenic diagnoses, has grown over the last two decades. In Murray v. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Murray was a Risperidone user who was prescribed the medication at age 9 and developed male breasts. A jury decided in Murray's

However in recent years, orchiectomy is not commonly used since medical castration is a viable option. Medical castration means that drugs or medications are used to suppress the production of androgens such as testosterone. Some examples of medications used in medical castration include, euprolide, goserelin (Zoladex), buserelin, and triptorelin (Trelstar). Some of the side effects of these medications include but are not limited to "Reduced sexual desire and libido, Impotence, reduced size of testes and penis, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue (gynaecomastia) and pain across the breasts, thinning of the bones or osteoporosis and risk of fracture, anemia, loss of muscle mass, weight gain, fatigue and memory problems, and depression."

  Testosterone therapy (TTh), which aims to restore testosterone levels to mid-normal ranges in men diagnosed with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), is an approved treatment. Treatment for oligospermia is centered around underlying causes, such as endocrine and systematic disorders that can cause hypogonadism. Typically, other assisted reproductive technologies are used. Although there is no FDA indication for use of aromatase inhibitors improving spermatogenesis, testolactone has been shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Though there is no FDA indication for the use of clomiphene in male infertility, it has been prescribed since the 1960s. As of 2013, there is not substantial evidence to suggest that clomiphene can treat male infertility. Combinations of vitamins and minerals, including selenium, co-enzyme Q10, L-carnitine, folic acid, zinc, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to improve male infertility, but due to

  Testosterone (T) is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. Women

['Suzanne Somers, the actress and author, has become a leading advocate for a "natural" approach to treating menopause. She has written several books on the subject, including "Ageless: The Naked Truth About Beauty, Sex, and Success, Being Over 40" and "Sexy Forever: How to Fight Fat After Forty."\n\nSomers\' approach involves using bioidentical hormones, which are chemically identical to the hormones produced by the body. She believes that these hormones are safer and more effective than traditional hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and other health problems.\n\nSomers has also been a vocal critic of the medical establishment\'s approach to menopause, which she believes is too focused on pharmaceutical solutions and not enough on natural remedies. She has called for more research into the benefits of bioidentical hormones and has been a leading voice in the movement to promote alternative approaches to menopause.\n\nIn addition to her advocacy work, Somers has also been a successful businesswoman, launching a line of beauty and wellness products under the name "Suzanne Somers Collection." She has also appeared in numerous television shows and movies, including "Three\'s Company" and "The Diary of Anne Frank."\n\nSomers\' approach to menopause has been met with both', 'Suzanne Somers advocates ‘natural’ approach when treating menopause']

  Janine O'Leary Cobb is a women's health activist and educator, and the author of one of the first popular books on menopause intended for a mainstream audience, Understanding Menopause (first published in 1988, now in its 6th edition, published 2005). Cobb is recognized widely as a pioneer in the women's health movement in North America and has won critical recognition for her work in the field. In 1984 she founded the popular health newsletter, A Friend Indeed, dedicated to highlighting the increasing medicalization of menopause, and to breaking the taboo of silence that still hung over many important women's health issues, such as menstruation, menopause and breast cancer. The publication continued to be released bi-monthly under the stewardship of other editors until 2006. Cobb was previously a professor with Vanier College, Montreal and is currently a Board member with Breast Cancer Action Montreal. She is also a contributor to Our Bodies, Ourselves, the groundbreaking women's health collective. She lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Further studies in support of the theory have shown that suppressing the HPG axis, such as when organisms experience either caloric restriction, cold, or exercise stress, increases lifespan. This is thought to be an evolutionary conserved mechanism that allows organisms to suppress HPG axis signaling and reproduction, thereby conserving reproductive resources (germ cells) for a later time when the environment is better suited to raising offspring.

In an article titled "I'm healing myself from cancer naturally" written by Ainscough for the teen magazine she once edited, Ainscough wrote: "I am ecstatic to report that it has worked for me. I have had no cancer spread, no more lumps pop up (they were popping up rapidly before) and I can actually see some of my tumors coming out through my skin and disappearing'" It was reported that Ainscough earned a "six figures" income from the "Wellness Warrior" brand.

['A new experimental drug has shown promise in raising good cholesterol levels in a small, early-stage trial, according to results presented at the American College of Cardiology\'s 64th Annual Scientific Session.\nThe drug, called PCSK9 inhibitor, is designed to lower levels of LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, by targeting a protein that prevents the liver from removing LDL from the bloodstream.\nThe study, which included 245 patients, found that those who received the highest dose of the drug had an average 55 percent reduction in LDL levels.\nThe results are particularly significant because they come on the heels of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed a similar drug, called evolocumab, reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and death by 15 percent in patients with a history of heart attack or stroke.\nThe new study, which was funded by Amgen, the maker of the drug, included patients with high cholesterol levels who were already taking statins, the most commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs.\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one of three doses of the drug.\nThe results showed that the drug was well-tolerated, with no serious side effects reported.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Marc Sabatine, a', 'Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial']

As with statins, this decrease in intra-hepatic (liver) LDL levels may induce hepatic LDL receptor up-regulation, also decreasing plasma LDL levels. As always, a key issue is how benefits and complications of such agents compare with statins—molecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s. ; Phytosterols are widely recognized as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy, although no scientifically proven beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or overall mortality exists. Current supplemental guidelines for reducing LDL recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0 grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15 gram per day.

Some have increased mortality rates compared with placebo. ; Clofibrate is effective at lowering cholesterol levels, but has been associated with significantly increased cancer and stroke mortality, despite lowered cholesterol levels. Other, more recently developed and tested fibrates, e.g. fenofibric acid have had a better track record and are primarily promoted for lowering VLDL particles (triglycerides), not LDL particles, yet can help some in combination with other strategies. ; Some Tocotrienols, especially delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, are being promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having been shown in vitro to have an effect. In particular, gamma-tocotrienol appears to be another

  how much lower. This low level of less than 70 mg/dL (higher than Tim Russert's value shortly prior to his heart attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels. It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of

  There were two clinical trials that evaluated the benefits and side effects of bempedoic acid. The trial designs were similar. All enrolled subjects were on a lipid-lowering diet and taking the highest dose of a statin (drug commonly used to lower cholesterol) for high cholesterol. In both trials, subjects were randomly assigned to receive bempedoic acid or placebo tablets every day for 52-weeks. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given. The trials measured percent change in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) blood levels from baseline to week twelve and compared bempedoic acid to placebo. In one clinical trial, bempedoic acid reduced

  In the US, the American Heart Association, NIH, and NCEP provide a set of guidelines for fasting LDL-Cholesterol levels, estimated or measured, and risk for heart disease. As of about 2005, these guidelines were: Over time, with more clinical research, these recommended levels keep being reduced because LDL reduction, including to abnormally low levels, was the most effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular death rates in one large double blind, randomized clinical trial of men with hypercholesterolemia; far more effective than coronary angioplasty/stenting or bypass surgery. For instance, for people with known atherosclerosis diseases, the 2004 updated American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70 mg/dL,

['In a recent case, a 28-year-old man presented to the emergency department with severe diarrhea. The patient reported that he had ingested a few drops of Visine brand eye drops in an attempt to alleviate a headache. The patient had no history of gastrointestinal disease or recent changes in diet.\n\nUpon examination, the patient was found to have watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and dehydration. Laboratory tests revealed no significant abnormalities, except for a mildly elevated white blood cell count.\n\nThe patient was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes, and was discharged after 24 hours with instructions to follow up with a primary care physician. The patient was advised to avoid ingesting eye drops in the future, and to seek medical attention if symptoms persisted or worsened.\n\nThe mechanism of action for this adverse effect is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to the presence of tetrahydrozoline, a vasoconstrictor commonly found in eye drops. Tetrahydrozoline can cause gastrointestinal symptoms when ingested, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of proper labeling and instructions for over-the-counter medications, as well as the potential for unintended', 'A few drops of Visine brand eye drops taken internally will induce uncontrollable diarrhea.']

["The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Kyleena, a new intrauterine system (IUS) for the prevention of pregnancy for up to five years. Kyleena is a small, plastic device that is placed in the uterus by a healthcare professional. It releases a progestin hormone, levonorgestrel, continuously for up to five years.\nKyleena is the fourth IUS approved by the FDA. The other three are Mirena, which is approved for use for up to three years, and two newer devices, Liletta and Skyla, which are approved for use for up to three and four years, respectively.\nThe safety and effectiveness of Kyleena were evaluated in a clinical trial of 1,001 women who were followed for up to two years. The most commonly reported adverse events in the clinical trial were menstrual changes, acne, headache, and ovarian cyst.\nKyleena is manufactured by Bayer AG, based in Leverkusen, Germany.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplement", "FDA Approves Bayer's Kyleena™ (Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System) 19.5 mg for Prevention of Pregnancy for up to Five Years"]

  There are many types of contraceptive methods available. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. In 2006–2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%), male sterilization (8.8%), intrauterine device (4.9%), withdrawal (4.6%). Depo-Provera is used by 2.9%, primarily younger women (7.5% of those 15-19 and about 4.5%

The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a "black box" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods.

  Contraception has many benefits beyond preventing pregnancy. Combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives can successfully treat dysmenorrhea (painful periods), provide symptom relief from endometriosis, reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and improve anemia related to menstrual blood loss, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, reduce ovarian and colon cancer risk, reduce moderate acne, prevent of menstrual migraines, and reduce hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). The progestin-containing intrauterine device can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and protect against pre-cancerous changes or cancer in the uterus. Condoms (male or female) are the only contraceptive method which protects against acquisition of sexually transmitted infections. According to the New York Times of 6 October 2017, the Trump administration at that time moved to expand the rights of employers to not purchase insurance plans that covered contraception for women employees. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, "two rules rolling back a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The rules offer an exemption to any employer that objects to covering contraception services on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions".

  In 1953, Bayer brought the first neuroleptic (chlorpromazine) onto the German market. In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, Primodos, that consisted of two pills that contained norethisterone (as acetate) and ethinylestradiol. It detected pregnancy by inducing menstruation in women who were not pregnant; the presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for birth defects, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date and found the

  In 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the previous federal requirement for employers to cover birth control in the health insurance plans for their employees. Under this new rule, hundreds of thousands of women would lose their ability to have their birth control costs covered for them. The new rule would let insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions". However, later in 2017 federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of this new rule. Push for possible over the counter policies Some doctors and researchers, including the American Medical Association (AMA), would like the availability of the birth control pills to be extended to over the counter instead of prescription only status. They state that providing over the counter contraceptives could increase overall contraceptive accessibility for young

  The combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring is self-administered once a month. Leaving the ring in for three weeks slowly releases hormones into the body, mainly vaginally administered estrogens and/or progestogens (a group of hormones including progesterone) - the same hormones used in birth control pills. These hormones work mostly by stopping ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus, creating a barrier preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. They could theoretically affect implantation but no evidence shows that they do. Worn continuously for three weeks followed by a week off, each vaginal ring provides anywhere from one month (NuvaRing) to one year (Annovera and Progering) of birth control. For continuous-use contraception, users

  Progesterone is a medication often used to prevent threatened miscarriage. A threatened miscarriage is signs or symptoms of miscarriage, most often including bleeding that occurs in the first 20-weeks of a pregnancy. Research has shown that supplementation of progesterone can lower the rate of miscarriage, however, it did not have an effect on lowering the rate of pre-term births and live births. In reference to micronized vaginal progesterone, these results were more prominent for people who were at high risk of miscarriage, including people who have had three or more miscarriages and are currently experiencing bleeding. The use of low dose aspirin may be linked to increased rates of live births

In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions.

It was later reported he suffered a back injury and would miss 4–6 weeks to recover. At the time of his injury, he led the team in goals, points, shots on goal, and power-play points. Despite missing the final 16 games of the season, Boeser was named a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy which is awarded to the league's best rookie of the year. The award was ultimately won by New York Islanders centre Mathew Barzal. Boeser recovered from his injury enough to join the Canucks

The NHL suspended Ritchie for two games (one regular season and one playoff game) on the basis that Ritchie's punch was unexpected and Rozsíval was not prepared to fight or defend himself. Rozsíval missed the Blackhawks 2016–17 finale and the entire 2017 playoffs due to the injury.

He lasted just 26 games with the Bruins before the team suspended him indefinitely for "screaming profanities at coach Pat Burns." Murphy made few friends in the Bruins locker room and was said to have questioned his teammates' work ethic and was known to tell off both teammates and the coaching staff. "This has been going on for a while," Burns said at the time of the suspension. "The players have had enough and I have had enough."

Shore visited several doctors who wanted to amputate the ear, but finally found one who sewed it back on. After refusing anaesthetic, Shore used a mirror to watch the doctor sew the ear back on. Shore claimed Coutu used his hockey stick to cut off the ear, and Coutu was fined $50; Shore later recanted and Coutu's money was refunded. At the end of

In his second game of the season playing for Iowa, Harding suffered from dehydration, which was related to his multiple sclerosis, and had to be hospitalized.

["The Zika virus has been linked to a birth defect called microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads. The virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes, but it can also be sexually transmitted.\n\nIn Brazil, where the outbreak began, the number of cases of microcephaly has skyrocketed. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, there were 1,300 reported cases of microcephaly in 2015, compared to just 147 in 2014.\n\nThe most likely triggering cause of microcephaly, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 4,100 pregnant women in Brazil, found that women who received the DTaP shot during their first trimester were more likely to give birth to babies with microcephaly.\n\nThe DTaP shot is a combination vaccine that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough). The vaccine has been in use for decades and is considered safe.\n\nHowever, the study's authors caution that the vaccine may be linked to microcephaly in certain circumstances. They suggest", 'The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly)" is the "DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women.']

The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus. Outside of Brazil, Zika virus was transmitted at an alarming rate and by March 2016 the virus had affected at least 33 countries and territories in America.

  many fronts, with much effort devoted to developing anti-Zika virus vaccines and therapeutics. According to The WHO, 18 companies were working on the vaccines, as of March 2016. The WHO's priority was to develop a vaccine that was safe for use by pregnant women. With that in mind, the research institutions aimed to create inactivated vaccines, which were produced by treating infectious viruses with chemicals that destroy infectivity but maintain the capacity of the virus to induce a protective immune response. In 2016, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted

Later research and evidence bore out these concerns; in April, the WHO stated that "there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome." This was the first time a PHEIC was declared for a mosquito‐borne disease. This declaration was lifted on 18 November 2016.

  Zika virus has been shown to have teratogenic effects, causing defects in fetal neurological development. Cerebral organoids have been used in studies in order to understand the process by which Zika virus affects the fetal brain and, in some cases, causes microcephaly. Cerebral organoids infected with the Zika virus have been found to be smaller in size than their uninfected counterparts, which is reflective of fetal microcephaly. Increased apoptosis was also found in cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus. Another study found that neural progenitor cell (NPC) populations were greatly reduced in these samples. The two methods by which NPC populations were reduced were increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation. TLR3 receptor upregulation was identified in these infected organoids. Inhibition of this TLR3 receptor was shown to partially halt some of the Zika induced effects. Additionally, lumen size was found to be increased in organoids infected with Zika virus. The results found from studying cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus at different stages of maturation suggest that early exposure in developing fetuses can cause greater likelihood of Zika virus-associated neurological birth defects.

  In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths each year. With 100% immunization, and 100% efficacy of the vaccines, one out of seven deaths among young children could be prevented, mostly in developing countries, making this an important global health issue. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus. The Immunization Surveillance, Assessment and Monitoring program of the WHO monitors and assesses the safety and effectiveness of programs and vaccines at reducing illness and deaths from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines. Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine.

  The Meningitis Vaccine Project is an effort to eliminate the meningitis epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa by developing a new meningococcal vaccine. The meningitis problem in that area is caused by a strain of meningitis called "meningitis A", which is present only in the African meningitis belt. In June 2010 various sources announced that they had developed MenAfriVac, which is an inexpensive, safe, and highly effective vaccine which is likely to stop the epidemic as quickly as anyone had ever hoped that it would. The project marked the first time that medical research had developed a vaccine to combat a disease which is endemic to and only a problem for Africa. The project began in 2001 when the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded the World Health Organization and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) a US $70 million seed grant to begin research.

The initial outbreak of Zika in Brazil occurred during the winter months, but in Northeastern states near the equator, where there is no winter season throughout the year. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that "there is no public health reason to cancel or delay the Olympics".

  prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine "overload", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

["CVI: The impairment affecting children whose eyes are fine.\n\nCortical Visual Impairment (CVI) is a condition that affects the brain's ability to process visual information. It is not an issue with the eyes themselves, but rather a problem with how the brain interprets and understands visual information. CVI can result from a variety of factors, including prematurity, stroke, trauma, infections, and genetic disorders.\n\nChildren with CVI may have difficulty with visual tasks that involve memory, attention, and spatial reasoning. They may struggle with tasks such as copying from a chalkboard, reading, and recognizing faces. They may also have difficulty with visual-motor tasks, such as cutting with scissors or copying shapes.\n\nHowever, children with CVI are not necessarily visually impaired in all areas. They may have strengths in certain areas, such as visual memory or visual attention. These strengths can be used to help them compensate for their weaknesses.\n\nTo support children with CVI, educators and parents can work together to create a learning environment that is tailored to the child's needs. This may involve using visual aids, such as large print or pictures, to help the child understand concepts. It may also involve using strategies to help the child remember information, such as repetition or visual cues.\n\nIn addition, educators and parents can work with", 'CVI: The impairment affecting children whose eyes are fine.']

  The Children's Nonverbal Learning Disabilities Scale (C-NLD) is an assessment that screens for the symptoms for nonverbal learning disabilities in children, which can affect a child's visual spatial organization, motor abilities, and social interactions. All questions in the assessment are categorized in three headings: motor skills, visual-spatial skills, and interpersonal skills. The C-NLD is a 15 question measure intended to be filled out by the parent or guardian of the child. Each of the 15 questions are answered based on a four-option Likert scale, containing "Never/Rarely", "Sometimes", "Often/Always", and "I don't know" answer choices. The scale contains three sections; the first section is designed to assess motor skills consists of 4 questions, the second section is designed to assess visual-spatial skills consists of 7 questions, and the last section assesses interpersonal skills and consists of 4 questions.

  The Riddoch syndrome is a term coined by Zeki and Ffytche (1998) in a paper published in Brain. The term acknowledges the work of George Riddoch who was the first to describe a condition in which a form of visual impairment, caused by lesions in the occipital lobe, leaves the sufferer blind but able to distinguish visual stimuli with specific characteristics when these appear in the patient's blind field.

  addition, writing may take longer and require greater effort on the student's part. Factors linked to handwriting include postural stability, sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand, and writing tool pressure. Speech impairments may be seen in children with CP depending on the severity of brain damage. Communication in a school setting is important because communicating with peers and teachers is very much a part of the "school experience" and enhances social interaction. Problems with language or motor dysfunction can lead to underestimating a student's intelligence. In summary, children with CP may experience difficulties in school, such as difficulty with handwriting, carrying out school activities, communicating verbally, and interacting socially.

  Visual acuity is the eyes ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance. The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a "person of normal vision" at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is used in countries using the metric system, and that represents the distance in metres. This is often measured with a Snellen chart or LogMAR chart

  There is no general consensus on the definition of CBS. Predominant factors correlated with CBS are a decrease of visual acuity, visual field loss, and elderly age. While characteristic features of visual hallucinations are not specifically linked to the anatomical site of the ocular injury, they usually match to the location of visual loss. The most commonly accepted theory for Charles Bonnet Syndrome proposes that extreme visual impairment promotes sensory deafferentation, leading to disinhibition, thus resulting in sudden neural firings of the visual cortical regions. A few studies record that visual hallucinations are likely to be concentrated in the blind regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging

  Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary among people and over time. Often, symptoms include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, and speaking. Often, babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl or walk as early as other children of their age. Other symptoms include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning, which each occur in about one-third of people with CP. While symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life, underlying problems do not worsen over time. Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of

For many years a primary focus of the foundation was to get sensory processing disorder added to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Sensory Processing Disorder was defined as "a complex disorder of the brain that affects developing children and adults". Currently Sensory Processing Disorder or SPD is defined as "differences in sensory integration and processing that prevent function and participation in day-to-day life". SPD remains poorly recognized.

  Some common tests that measure visual health include visual acuity tests, refraction tests, visual field tests and colour vision tests. Visual acuity tests are the most common tests and they measure the ability to bring details into focus at different distances. Usually this test is conducted by having participants read a map of letters or symbols while one eye is covered. Refraction tests measure the eye's need for glasses or corrective lenses. This test is able to detect whether a person may be nearsighted or farsighted. These conditions occur when the light rays entering the eye are unable to converge on a single spot on the retina.

['In recent years, there has been a significant increase in reported cases of a rare and potentially deadly bacterial infection known as necrotizing fasciitis, commonly referred to as "flesh-eating bacteria." This bacterial infection is caused by a group of bacteria, including group A streptococcus, group B streptococcus, and Vibrio vulnificus, which can rapidly spread through the body and cause severe tissue damage and death.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were approximately 700 reported cases of necrotizing fasciitis in the United States in 2019, resulting in 117 deaths. This represents a 20% increase in reported cases compared to 2018, and a 50% increase in deaths.\n\nThe majority of reported cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur in individuals over the age of 65, with the highest incidence rates reported in individuals over the age of 85. However, the infection can occur in individuals of all ages, and can be particularly dangerous in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nThe symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis can be difficult to distinguish from other, less serious infections, and can include fever, chills, and pain,', 'An image shows reported cases of "flesh eating bacteria" in 2019.']

  F. necrophorum is responsible for 10% of acute sore throats, 21% of recurrent sore throats and 23% of peritonsillar abscesses with the remainder being caused by Group A streptococci or viruses. Other complications from F. necrophorum include meningitis, complicated by thrombosis of the internal jugular vein, thrombosis of the cerebral veins, and infection of the urogenital and the gastrointestinal tracts. Although this infection is rare, researchers agree that this diagnosis should be considered in a septicaemic patient with thrombosis in an unusual site, and underlying malignancy should be excluded in cases of confirmed F. necrophorum occurring at sites caudal to the head. The above statistical analysis is dated, necessarily. A 2015 study of young adult students presenting to a single clinic in Alabama had F. necrophorum as the predominate causative organism for pharyngitis 21% of the time (and found in 9% of asymptomatic students). In the same study, Group A Streptococcus was found in 10% of pharyngitis patients (1% of asymptomatic students).

Active surveillance through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) indicates that about 20 cases are diagnosed each year for each 100,000 people in the US, while many more cases are undiagnosed or unreported; the CDC estimates a total of 1.5 million infections every year.

Infections which are in the deep tissues ( necrotizing cellulitis, fasciitis and myositis) often include Clostridium spp., S. pyogenes or polymicrobic combinations of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Gas in the tissues and putrid-like pus with a gray thin quality are often found in these infections, and they are frequently associated with a bacteremia and high mortality rate. Treatment of deep-seated soft-tissue infections includes: vigorous surgical management that includes surgical debridement and drainage. Even though there are no controlled studies that support this approach improvement of the involved tissues oxygenation by enhancement of blood supply and administration of hyperbaric oxygen, especially in clostridial infection, may be helpful.

  typically based on symptoms. Treatment includes intravenous fluids, antibiotics, incision and drainage of any abscesses, and possibly intravenous immunoglobulin. The need for rapid removal of infected tissue via surgery in those with a streptococcal cause, while commonly recommended, is poorly supported by the evidence. Some recommend delaying surgical debridement. The overall risk of death is about 50% in streptococcal disease, and 5% in staphylococcal disease. Death may occur within 2 days. In the United States, streptococcal TSS occurs in about 3 per 100,000 per year, and staphylococcal TSS in about 0.5 per 100,000 per year. The condition is more common in the developing world. It was first described in 1927. Due to the association with very absorbent tampons, these products were removed from sale.

  Romero's original Night of the Living Dead explains that an unknown phenomenon causes re-animation of the brain. Instead of being spread from person to person, the phenomenon presents itself in any human that has recently died from any cause (except those that destroy the physical structure of the brain). The first animated corpses appear in many locations simultaneously, quickly reaching pandemic levels. Characters speculate about the cause of the phenomenon; suggestions at various times include a spaceborne virus, divine punishment, radiation from a satellite returning from Venus, or that "there's no more room in Hell".

  In 2006, Willis et al. published a time series measuring ocean heat content, which concluded that the ocean had cooled from 2003 to 2005. A similar conclusion was reached by scientists at NASA's Langley Research Center (LRC). While Willis cautioned against drawing conclusions based on such a short time period, the study was widely covered in the media, with climate change skeptics citing it as evidence that global warming was no longer occurring. Willis also noted that some model simulations show periods of four to five years during which the upper ocean does not warm. Willis suspected something was awry when the researchers at LRC concluded that Earth's energy imbalance had remained the same over that period of time, which led to a researcher at LRC named Takmeng Wong becoming "surprised, even a little alarmed" at Willis's results. The original 2006 paper has since been corrected, with Willis et al. stating, "Most of the rapid decrease in globally integrated upper (0–750 m) ocean heat content anomalies (OHCA) between 2003 and 2005 reported by Lyman et al. [2006] appears to be an artifact resulting from the combination of two different instrument biases recently discovered in the in situ profile data."

   In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain. Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat which warms the planet. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. She concluded that "An atmosphere of that gas would

  Public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. The actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists. Like the tobacco industry before, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results. Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as "climate change skeptics", which several

  isotope and Mg/Ca of carbonate shells precipitated in surface waters of the ocean are commonly used measurements for reconstructing past temperature; however, both paleotemperature proxies can be compromised at low latitude locations, because re-crystallization of carbonate on the seafloor renders lower values than when formed. On the other hand, these and other temperature proxies (e.g., TEX86) are impacted at high latitudes because of seasonality; that is, the “temperature recorder” is biased toward summer, and therefore higher values, when the production of carbonate and organic carbon occurred. Certainly, the central Arctic Ocean was ice-free before, during, and after the PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) at 87°N on Lomonosov Ridge. Moreover, temperatures increased during the PETM,

A similar conclusion was reached by scientists at NASA's Langley Research Center (LRC). While Willis cautioned against drawing conclusions based on such a short time period, the study was widely covered in the media, with climate change skeptics citing it as evidence that global warming was no longer occurring. Willis also noted that some model simulations show periods of four to five years during which the upper ocean does not warm. Willis suspected something was awry when the researchers at LRC concluded that Earth's energy imbalance had remained the same over that period of time, which led to a researcher at LRC named Takmeng Wong becoming "surprised, even a little alarmed" at Willis's results. The original 2006 paper has since been corrected, with Willis et al. stating, "Most of the rapid decrease in globally integrated upper (0–750 m) ocean heat content anomalies (OHCA) between 2003 and 2005 reported by Lyman et al. [2006] appears to be an artifact resulting from the combination of two different instrument biases recently discovered in the in situ profile data."

  In 2008, the U.S. FDA added black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones, advising of the increased risk of tendon damage. In 2016, the FDA found that systemic use (by mouth or injection) of fluoroquinolones was associated with "disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects" involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, concluding that these side effects generally outweigh the benefits for people with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections when other treatment options are available. Concerns regarding low blood sugar and mental health problems were added in 2018.

  overwhelmingly recommended stronger label warnings on the containers because of rare but sometimes devastating side effects. On 12 May 2016, the FDA issued a drug safety communication advising that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for these conditions only when no other options are available due to potentially permanent, disabling side effects occurring together. The drug safety communication also announced the required labeling updates to reflect this new safety information. The FDA put out another label change in July 2017, strengthening the warnings about potentially disabling adverse effects and limiting use of these drugs to second-line treatments for acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs.

  memory impairment, sleep disorders, and impaired hearing, vision, taste and smell. Tendon damage (especially to Achilles tendon but also other tendons) can occur within 48 hours of starting fluoroquinolone treatment but the damage may be delayed several months after stopping treatment. The overall rate of adverse events in people treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in people treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found people treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides,

In November 2015, an FDA Advisory Committee discussed the risks and benefits of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs based on new safety information. The new information focused on two or more side effects occurring at the same time and causing the potential for irreversible impairment. The advisory committee concluded that the serious risks associated with the use of fluoroquinolones for these types of uncomplicated infections generally outweighed the benefits for patients with other treatment options.

  More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate. Common side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of "black box" warnings in the United States. A 2018 EU-wide review of fluoroquinolones concluded that they are associated with serious side effects including tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression,

  such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. They proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Reports of serious adverse events began emerging, and the FDA first added a black-box warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. In February 2011, the risk of worsening symptoms for those with myasthenia gravis was added to the warning. In August 2013, the agency required updates

  Quinolones are associated with a small risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture; a 2013 review found the incidence of tendon injury among those taking fluoroquinolones to be between 0.08 and 0.20%. The risk appears to be higher among people older than 60 and those also taking corticosteroids; the risk also may be higher among people who are male, have a pre-existing joint or tendon issue, have kidney disease, or are highly active. Some experts have advised avoidance of fluoroquinolones in athletes. If tendonitis occurs, it generally appears within one month, and the most common tendon injured appears to be the Achilles tendon. The cause is not well understood.

  the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the U.S. FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 U.S. FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee included musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period. Meta-analyses conclude that fluoroquinolones pose little or no additional risk to children compared to other antibiotic classes. Fluoroquinolines use in children may be appropriate when the infection is caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, or when alternative treatment options require parenteral administration and oral therapy is preferred.

  Quinolones are not recommended in people with epilepsy, Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, or CNS inflammation, or who have had a stroke. They are best avoided in the athlete population. Safety concerns exist for fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy, so they are contraindicated unless no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. However, one meta-analysis looking at the outcome of pregnancies involving quinolone use in the first trimester found no increased risk of malformations. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system. Their use in children is not absolutely contraindicated, however. For certain severe infections where other antibiotics are not an option, their use can be justified. Quinolones should also not be given to people with a known hypersensitivity to the drug class. The basic pharmacophore, or active structure, of the fluoroquinolone class is based upon the quinoline ring system. The addition of the fluorine atom at C6 distinguishes the successive-generation fluoroquinolones from the first-generation of quinolones. The addition of the C6 fluorine atom has since been demonstrated not to be required for the antibacterial activity of this class (circa 1997).

  In most countries, fluoroquinolones are approved for use in children only under narrowly defined circumstances, owing in part to the observation of high rates of musculoskeletal adverse events in fluoroquinolone-treated juvenile animals. In the UK, the prescribing indications for fluoroquinolones for children are severely restricted. Only inhalant anthrax and pseudomonal infections in cystic fibrosis infections are licensed indications in the UK due to ongoing safety concerns. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, serious adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these were considered by the treating physician to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the study drug. Two deaths were observed

On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result.

The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing" On 7September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".

  New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in

["In recent years, states have passed laws requiring women to undergo mandatory ultrasounds before abortions. These laws, which have been challenged in court, have been met with controversy and debate.\n\nThe purpose of mandatory ultrasounds is to provide women with more information about their pregnancy and to give them the opportunity to reconsider their decision to have an abortion. Proponents of these laws argue that they are necessary to protect women's health and to ensure that they are making an informed decision.\n\nHowever, opponents of mandatory ultrasounds argue that they are an unnecessary and invasive procedure that can cause emotional distress and trauma. They argue that women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and their pregnancies without government interference.\n\nIn terms of the legal challenges to these laws, they have been struck down in some states, while others have upheld them. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case challenging a Texas law that requires women to undergo a sonogram and receive information about their pregnancy before an abortion.\n\nThe controversy surrounding mandatory ultrasounds before abortions is likely to continue as states continue to pass laws requiring them. It is a complex and emotionally charged issue that involves questions of women's rights, reproductive health, and government regulation.\n\nIn terms of the potential impact of mandatory ultrasounds on women's decision-making, studies have shown that they", 'On mandatory ultrasounds before abortions.']

  Obstetric ultrasonography, or prenatal ultrasound, is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or fetus in the uterus (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy,

  jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including "risks" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations. China, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy.

  Current evidence indicates that diagnostic ultrasound is safe for the unborn child, unlike radiographs, which employ ionizing radiation. Randomized controlled trials have followed children up to ages 8–9, with no significant differences in vision, hearing, school performance, dyslexia, or speech and neurologic development by exposure to ultrasound. In one randomized trial, the children with greater exposure to ultrasound had a reduction in perinatal mortality, and was attributed to the increased detection of anomalies in the ultrasound group. The 1985 maximum power allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 180 milliwatts per square cm is well under the levels used in therapeutic ultrasound, but still higher than the 30-80 milliwatts per square cm range of the Statison V veterinary LIPUS device.

  In most countries, routine pregnancy sonographic scans are performed to detect developmental defects before birth. This includes checking the status of the limbs and vital organs, as well as (sometimes) specific tests for abnormalities. Some abnormalities detected by ultrasound can be addressed by medical treatment in utero or by perinatal care, though indications of other abnormalities can lead to a decision regarding abortion. Perhaps the most common such test uses a measurement of the nuchal translucency thickness ("NT-test", or "Nuchal Scan"). Although 91% of fetuses affected by Down syndrome exhibit this defect, 5% of fetuses flagged by the test do not have Down syndrome. Ultrasound may also detect fetal organ anomaly.

  Subsequently, 25 states have examined similar legislation related to fetal pain and/or fetal anesthesia, and in 2010 Nebraska banned abortions after 20 weeks on the basis of fetal pain. Eight states – Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Alaska, South Dakota, and Texas – have passed laws which introduced information on fetal pain in their state-issued abortion-counseling literature, which one opponent of these laws, the Guttmacher Institute founded by Planned Parenthood, has called "generally irrelevant" and not in line "with the current medical literature". Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said laws such as these "reduce... the process of informed consent to the reading of a fixed script created and mandated by politicians not doctors."

 5 -2.05145  Obstetric ultrasonography, or prenatal ultrasound, is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or fetus in the uterus (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy,

['A Facebook post that has been circulating in recent days claims that there is no COVID-19 virus. The post, which has been shared thousands of times, features a photo of a microscope slide with a few cells and the text: "This is what the COVID-19 virus looks like. There is no such thing."\n\nHowever, this claim is false. The COVID-19 virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has been extensively studied and identified by scientists around the world. The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the coronavirus family. It is highly contagious and can cause severe respiratory illness, particularly in older adults and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nThe photo in the Facebook post is not a picture of the COVID-19 virus. Instead, it appears to be a photo of a cell culture infected with a different virus, likely the human papillomavirus (HPV). The photo was taken by a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and was shared on Twitter in 2018 as part of a project to develop a vaccine for HPV.\n\nThe Facebook post also claims that the COVID-19 virus is a "manufactured" virus. This is not true. The COVID-19 virus is a natural virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is', 'Facebook post Says "there is no" COVID-19 virus.']

  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most

  the country with the most deaths on 19 March 2020. By 26 March the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country. Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019, and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6February 2020. RT-PCR testing of untreated wastewater samples from Brazil and Italy have suggested detection of SARS-CoV-2 as early as November and

On February 26, 2020, a case of unknown origin was confirmed in a resident of Solano County. The UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento said that, when the person was transferred there on February 19, the medical team suspected it was COVID-19 and asked the CDC to test for SARS-CoV-2. The CDC initially refused since the person, who had no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual, did not

  The virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection. There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing. Phylogenetics estimates that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019. A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan. Evidence suggests that it descends from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host. The possibility that the virus was accidentally released from a laboratory is also under increasingly active consideration. The first confirmed human infections were in

  Polypropylene breast implants, also known as string breast implants, are a form of breast implant using polypropylene developed by Gerald W. Johnson. Due to a number of medical complications, the device has not been approved in the European Union or the United States. Polypropylene implants absorb water very slowly, about <0.01% in 24 hours. The polypropylene, which is yarn-like, causes irritation to the implant pocket which causes the production of serum which fills the implant pocket on a continual basis. This causes continuous expansion of the breast after surgery. Growth can only be alleviated by removal of serum by syringe. Problems can also

All the charges were dismissed. Van Voast filed a federal lawsuit on May 15 against the city and the police department. In February 2013, the New York City Police Department issued a command to all its officers through their daily roll call. It reminded officers that they are not to cite or arrest a woman for public lewdness, indecent exposure or any other section of the Penal Law for "simply exposing their breasts in public."

  if the breasts enlarge at different rates. This can be corrected by removal of serum or introduction of sterile saline. Continual breast growth will eventually result in "extreme, almost cartoonish breast sizes." String implants were only available for a very short time in the US before being removed from the market by the FDA around 2001. Polypropylene implant have created the largest recorded increases in breast size due to surgical augmentation. They are rarely seen outside the adult entertainment industry.

He claimed £3.8m in lost earnings and damage to reputation, arguing that if the procedure were proper, by having a lawyer and someone from his department on the panel, the allegations would not have been established against him, and his career would not have been wrecked. The GMC, however, did not prevent him continuing to work.

  On 25 June 2008 a moulding company in Leicester was fined £5,300 and ordered to pay £2,134.10 after an employee suffered serious burns after he removed a mould plug during a routine operation at Harrison Castings Ltd. The burns required several skin grafts and five days in hospital for the employee. Inspector Munera Sidat said that the accident could have been prevented had the company provided the right type of gloves saying "Instead of foundry gloves which provide heat resistance, he was wearing rigger gloves which offered him very little protection. Not only did the molten metal permeate straight through the material, but the gloves were also so short that the liquid went up his jacket sleeves, making his burns worse." The company was charged under regulation 6 of the regulations which states that an assessment of the PPE provided should be made to ensure that it is suitable for the task".

  In the US in the 2000s, companies and figures in the popular media have heavily marketed notions of "andropause" as something parallel to menopause; these notions have been rejected by the medical community. Additionally, advertising from drug companies selling testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as dietary supplement companies selling all kinds of "boosters" for aging men, have emphasized the "need" of middle-aged or ageing men for testosterone. There is a medical condition called late-onset hypogonadism; according to Thomas Perls and David J. Handelsman, writing in a 2015 editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, it appears that this condition is overdiagnosed and overtreated. Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, "sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales."

  Testosterone (T) is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. Women

  Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. It may accelerate pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before starting therapy, and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy. Ethnic groups have different rates of prostate cancer. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer.

  Adverse effects of testosterone supplementation may include increased cardiovascular events (including strokes and heart attacks) and deaths based on three peer-reviewed studies involving men taking testosterone replacement. In addition, an increase of 30% in deaths and heart attacks in older men has been reported. Due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial (a National Institute of Aging randomized trial) was halted early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee.

However, the changes were small in magnitude, and the long-term significance in relation to cardiovascular outcomes is uncertain. The changes were more pronounced with oral testosterone undecanoate than with parenteral routes, such as transdermal testosterone. Testosterone showed no significant effect on depressed mood anxiety, bone mineral density (BMD), or anthropomorphic measures like body weight or body mass index. Conversely, it was associated with a significant incidence of androgenic side effects, including acne and hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth). Other androgenic side effects, such

Although testosterone has been found to be effective at improving sexual function in postmenopausal women, the doses employed have been supraphysiological. In contrast to these high doses, there is little support for the notion that testosterone is a critical hormone for sexual desire and function in women under normal physiological circumstances. Low doses of testosterone resulting in physiological levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) have

  that "Evidence is lacking for many compounds believed to enhance athletic performance. Its use has a sort of urban legend element and there is not much out there that it is clearly that effective. I would be shocked if this stuff [meldonium] had an effect greater than caffeine or creatine (a natural substance that, when taken as a supplement, is thought to enhance muscle mass)." Ford Vox, a U.S.-based physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist reported "there's not much scientific support for its use as an athletic enhancer". Don Catlin, a long-time anti-doping expert and the scientific director of the Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG) said "There's really no evidence that there's any performance enhancement from meldonium – Zero percent".

  been found to significantly increase sexual desire or function in women in most studies. Similarly, there appears to be little or no relationship between total or free testosterone levels in the normal physiological range and sexual desire in premenopausal women. Only high doses of testosterone resulting in supraphysiological levels of testosterone (>50 ng/dL) significantly increase sexual desire in women, with levels of testosterone of 80 to 150 ng/dL "slightly" increasing sex drive. In accordance, men experience sexual dysfunction at testosterone levels of below 300 ng/dL, and men that have levels of testosterone of approximately 200 ng/dL frequently experience such problems.

A diagnosis consistent with PMIS was also reported in a UK-born, 21-year-old man of Somali origin. A case report published in The Lancet regarding a 45-year-old Hispanic man who presented in New York with features strongly resembling MIS-C called for awareness of "a potential MIS-C-like condition in adults." Further reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome linked to COVID-19 exposure emerged in adults. In October, the CDC reported on the condition and named it 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults' (MIS-A). Questions have

Clusters of cases of the newly described condition have been recorded 3–4 weeks after peaks in SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission through various local communities. Such observations have been seen to support the concept that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be capable of triggering a severe form of a Kawasaki-like disease. Frequent presentation without prominent respiratory symptoms in children who do not appear to have ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection but who have already developed antibodies suggests that the disease may be driven by a delayed, post-infectious mechanism.

['A blood test may predict whether a person will develop rheumatoid arthritis, according to a study published in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatology.\nThe test, which measures the levels of a protein called serum amyloid A (SAA), could help doctors identify people at risk for the disease, which affects 1.3 million Americans, and intervene earlier to prevent or slow its progression.\n"This is a very exciting finding," said lead author Dr. John Davis, a rheumatologist at the University of Manchester in England. "We\'ve known for some time that SAA is a marker of inflammation, but this is the first time we\'ve been able to show that it can predict who will develop rheumatoid arthritis."\nThe study involved 1,000 people in the general population who were followed for 10 years. At the beginning of the study, researchers measured the levels of SAA in their blood. Over the course of the study, 100 people developed rheumatoid arthritis.\nThe researchers found that people with the highest levels of SAA were more than 10 times as likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis as those with the lowest levels.\nThe study also found that people with the highest levels of SAA were more likely to develop other autoimm', 'Blood Test May Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis']

  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disorder in which the body's own immune system starts to attack body tissues. The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, most damage occurs to the joint lining and cartilage which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones. RA often affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows, is symmetrical (appears on both sides of the body), and can lead to severe deformity in a few years if not treated. RA occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin rash, fever, pain, disability, and limitations in daily activities. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better

  of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset. The risk factors with the strongest association for developing rheumatoid arthritis are the female sex, a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, age, obesity, previous joint damage from an injury, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing osteoclasts and bone forming osteoblasts. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. Osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the RANK/RANKL mechanism.

  Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. All arthritides potentially feature pain. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. Rheumatoid arthritis is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness lasting over 30 minutes. However, in the early stages, patients may have no symptoms after a warm shower. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, tends to be associated with morning stiffness which eases relatively quickly with movement and exercise. In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient

Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity. Blood tests and X-rays of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor (ANF), extractable nuclear antigen, and specific antibodies.

  Certain autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) are significantly more likely to occur in women. Some populations of women are also more likely to be affected than others. For example, SLE is two to four times more prevalent in black women when compared to white women. Studies have shown that women with SLE are at least nine times more likely to experience a myocardial infarction when compared to the general population, with some estimates showing a 50-fold increase in risk. Similarly, RA increases the risk of death from CVD by 50%.

Arthritis is more common in women than men at all ages and affects all races, ethnic groups and cultures. In the United States a CDC survey based on data from 2013 to 2015 showed 54.4 million (22.7%) adults had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 23.7 million (43.5% of those with arthritis) had arthritis-attributable activity limitation (AAAL). With an aging population, this number is expected to increase. Adults with co-morbid conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, were seen to have a

  and exercise may also be useful. Recommended medications may depend on the form of arthritis. These may include pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen). In some circumstances, a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people, while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1–2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected by arthritis, while in the United States more than 20% have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is derived from arthr- (meaning 'joint') and -itis (meaning 'inflammation').

  Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types of arthritis, other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat.

RA often affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows, is symmetrical (appears on both sides of the body), and can lead to severe deformity in a few years if not treated. RA occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin rash, fever, pain, disability, and limitations in daily activities. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better

Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity. Blood tests and X-rays of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor (ANF), extractable nuclear antigen, and specific antibodies. Rheumatoid factor and ANA tests are generally negative in systemic JIA. Lab findings: anemia of chronic disease (can also appear in non-systemic types ), neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin). Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis.

  =  As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public. It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour. Some stores hoarded supplies, driving up prices, so the market regulator cracked down on such acts. The shortage will not be relieved until late February, when most workers return from the New Year vacation, according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry. On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group, said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. Special subsidies

Chinese-Americans also marshalled networks in China to obtain medical supplies. On 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff. While the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca said these medical supplies were donated by the Chinese Red Cross, there were other sources that said that these were paid products and services.

Press reported that the China Poly Group, together with other Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises, had an important role in scouring markets abroad to procure essential medical supplies and equipment for China. Risland (formerly Country Garden) sourced 82 tonnes of supplies, which were subsequently airlifted to Wuhan. By March, China has been producing 100 million masks per day to meet the demand of medical staff and general public.

A customs spokesperson said the mask exports were equivalent to "nearly 40 masks for everyone in the world outside China". Officials in Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected Chinese-made equipment for being defective. The Dutch Ministry of Health announced it had recalled 600,000 face masks which were made in China. The Spanish government said they bought thousands of test kits to combat the virus, but later revealed that almost 60,000 did not produce accurate results. The Chinese embassy in Spain said that the company that made the kits was unlicensed, and that these kits were separate from the ones donated by the Chinese government. The government of the United Kingdom paid two companies in China at least $20 million for test kits later found to be faulty.

['Humira, a drug commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has been found to be an effective treatment for non-infectious uveitis, a type of eye inflammation. The study, published in the journal Ophthalmology, found that Humira, also known as adalimumab, was more effective than the current standard treatment, corticosteroids.\n\nThe study, led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, followed 120 patients with non-infectious uveitis for 12 months. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either Humira or corticosteroids. The researchers found that 75% of patients who received Humira had a significant reduction in inflammation, compared to 55% of patients who received corticosteroids.\n\nThe study also found that Humira was associated with fewer side effects than corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can cause a range of side effects, including cataracts, glaucoma, and increased risk of infection. Humira, on the other hand, has been shown to have a lower risk of side effects.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Mark A. Blumenfeld, said that the findings could have significant implications for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. "Humira is a non-steroid alternative that can provide', 'Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation']

  Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Long-term use of such medications must be closely monitored, however, due to the discomforting and potentially debilitating and life-threatening side-effects. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported

  the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients. Loss of visual acuity unrelated to the inflammation caused by the disorder, however, often remains unchanged despite usage of the drug. This is reflected by the lack of difference in visual acuity and the vision-related quality of life among various treatment categories in birdshot patients. Contraindications and adverse side-effects are always a factor, as well. A corticosteroid implant surgically placed within the eye can be used for patients who are not able to achieve remission on or tolerate immunodulatory therapy, or in cases where this option presents less of a burden on life than long-term medical therapy.

  Small extramacular lesions (lesions not threatening vision) may be observed without treatment. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4–6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. During treatment with pyrimethamine, leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Folinic acid protects against the decrease in platelets and white blood cells induced by pyrimethamine. Prednisone may be used for 3–6 weeks to reduce macular or optic nerve inflammation and can be started on day 3 of antibiotic therapy. Corticosteroids should not be used without concurrent antibiotic treatment or in immunocompromised patients due to the risk of exacerbation of the disease. Currently, there is no published evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that corticosteroids would be an effective adjunct for treating ocular toxoplasmosis. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be equivalent to triple therapy in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis and may be better tolerated. Clindamycin and azithromycin can also be considered as alternative therapies. Spiramycin may be used safely without undue risk of teratogenicity and may reduce the rate of transmission to the fetus. AIDS patients require chronic maintenance treatment.

  Although in the early stages of research, there are indications that anti-inflammatories can reduce symptoms in those with depression and mood disorders. While depression symptoms tend to be sensitive to placebo responses, clinical trials have shown that these benefits often outperform placebos when used on their own or in conjunction with anti-depressants, with NSAIDs and cytokine inhibitors each being shown effective by multiple trials. In addition, statins, poly-unsaturated fatty acids, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatories aimed at specific illnesses all have been shown to has positive effects on depression but in a lesser number of studies. However, despite initial evidence for the ability of anti-inflammatories to lessen depression symptoms, the diverse nature of methods used in these studies and the risks of side effects have been suggested to warrant caution when considering their potential as depression treatments. The use of NSAIDs in particular, has been cautioned due to concerns over potential side-effects and their potential the limit the effectiveness of certain antidepressants.

  cardiac inflammation; and c) treating the underlying disorder. In all cases of Loeffler endocarditis that have no specific treatment regimens for the underlying disorder, available studies recommend treating the inflammatory component of this disorder with non-specific immunosuppressive drugs, principally high-dosage followed by slowly-tapering to low-dosage maintenance corticosteroid regimens. Afflicted individuals who fail this regimen or present with cardiogenic shock may benefit from treatment with other non-specific immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, as adjuncts to, or replacements for, corticosteroids. However, individuals with an underlying therapeutically accessible disease should be treated for this disease; in seriously symptomatic cases, such individuals may be treated concurrently with a corticosteroid regimen. Examples of diseases underlying Loefflers myocarditis that are recommended for treatments directed at the underlying disease include:

  deposits is also reduced. It is believed that the action of corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agents is bound to inhibitive proteins of phospholipase A2, collectively called lipocortins. The lipocortins, in turn, control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, inhibiting the liberation of the molecular precursors of arachidonic acid. Intranasal mometasone alleviates symptoms such as rhinorrhea aquosa, nasal congestion, nasal drip, sneezing, and pharyngeal itching. Topical administration applied to skin reduces the inflammation associated with chronic or acute dermatosis. Although mometasone furoate does not have significant systemic immunomodulatory effects, it can be considered a local immunosuppressive drug because clinical studies have shown reductions (vs. baseline ) in neutrophils (a white blood cell) in the nasal mucosa. It could be also considered an antihistamine along with its glucocorticoid effects because it significantly reduces histamine and eosinophil cationic protein levels.

  Hypromellose solutions were patented as a semisynthetic substitute for tear-film. Its molecular structure is predicated upon a base celluloid compound that is highly water-soluble. Post-application, celluloid attributes of good water solubility reportedly aid in visual clarity. When applied, a hypromellose solution acts to swell and absorb water, thereby expanding the thickness of the tear-film. Hypromellose augmentation therefore results in extended lubricant time presence on the cornea, which theoretically results in decreased eye irritation, especially in dry climates, home, or work environments. On a molecular level, this polymer contains beta-linked D-glucose units that remain metabolically intact for days to weeks. On a manufacturing note, since hypromellose is a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, it is slightly more expensive to produce due to semisynthetic manufacturing processes. Aside from its widespread commercial and retail availability over the counter in a variety of products, Hypromellose 2% solution has been documented to be used during surgery to aid in corneal protection and during orbital surgery.

['In a bid to quell rumors and skepticism surrounding the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, President Felix Tshisekedi has taken to the airwaves to assure the population that the disease is real and that the government is doing everything in its power to contain it.\n\nThe outbreak, which was declared on May 8, has so far killed 25 people and infected 42 others, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nBut in a country where rumors and misinformation have long been a problem, some people are still skeptical that the outbreak is real.\n\nIn a televised address on Sunday, Tshisekedi said that the government was working to dispel these rumors and that it was committed to transparency in its response to the outbreak.\n\n"We are not hiding anything," he said. "We are working with our partners to ensure that the population is informed and that we are doing everything possible to contain the outbreak."\n\nThe president also addressed concerns about the safety of the vaccine being used to combat the outbreak.\n\n"The vaccine is safe and has been tested in other countries," he said. "We are working to ensure that it is available to as many people as possible."\n\nThe vaccine, which was developed by Merck, has been shown to be highly effective in preventing Ebola.\n\nIn a statement, the WHO said that', 'Ebola is real, Congo president tells skeptical population.']

  The Western African Ebola virus epidemic took more than 11,000 lives. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding causing organ failure, lack of oxygen to the body, and it can lead to death. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then it has spread to other countries. It affected mostly West African countries.

  In December 2013, the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa that began in Guinea spread to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as with health workers and visitors who returned to their respective countries. At the time of the elections the worst of the epidemic was over, although there were still a lesser number of prevalent cases. The seven opposition parties called for a postponement, citing alleged irregularities in the electoral roll, but their pleas were rejected by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI). Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG) also petitioned the Supreme Court of Guinea to have the election postponed, but it was rejected.

During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak.

The decision was controversial, with Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) responding with disappointment and describing the situation as "an Ebola gas can sitting in DRC that's just waiting for a match to hit it", while the WHO panel were unanimous in their decision that declaring it a PHEIC would not give any added benefit.

  On December 21, 2010, Bishop Thomas Olmsted of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix declared that a Catholic Healthcare West hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center, could no longer call itself a Catholic institution after a procedure was performed in 2009 to end a pregnancy to save a woman’s life. In a public statement, Bishop Olmsted called the procedure a direct abortion, which is in direct violation of The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. In a statement, St. Joseph’s President Linda Hunt said the hospital would comply with Olmsted’s decision, but she defended the actions of the hospital staff, stating, "If we are presented with a situation in which a pregnancy threatens a woman’s life,

The bill was passed under the procedures of the Congressional Review Act. In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. This will be an issue at the end of the first 100 days as Congress tries to avoid a government shutdown. In Fiscal Year 2014, Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the Title X Family Planning grant program. The proposed American Health Care Act, announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood "ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants".

  Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the Philippine Medical Association also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer". Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines. "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."

In 2007, he voted against a bill requiring hospitals to inform survivors of a sexual assault of the availability of emergency contraception. In 2012, Gardner co-sponsored the controversial so-called "personhood" legislation titled the Life Begins at Conception Act. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. According to The Denver Post, "Gardner conceded that with

['A recent study published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology found that an abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed data from over 1.2 million patients who underwent either an abortion or a vasectomy between 2000 and 2010.\n\nThe results showed that the risk of complications was significantly lower for women who underwent an abortion compared to men who underwent a vasectomy. Specifically, the risk of major complications was 0.05% for women who underwent an abortion, compared to 0.15% for men who underwent a vasectomy.\n\nThe study also found that the risk of minor complications was lower for women who underwent an abortion compared to men who underwent a vasectomy. The risk of minor complications was 1.3% for women who underwent an abortion, compared to 2.5% for men who underwent a vasectomy.\n\nThe researchers attributed the lower risk of complications for women who undergo an abortion to the fact that the procedure is typically performed in a clinical setting by trained medical professionals, whereas vasectomies are often performed by general practitioners or urologists.\n\nThe study also found that the cost of an abortion is', 'An "abortion procedure is actually safer than a vasectomy.']

  the United States. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. The drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. The most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using a suction device. Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year.

  14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical

  Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion" and occurs in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. When properly done, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death, especially in the developing world, while making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. It is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death

  risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy; from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more (as measured from the last menstrual period). It appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation (whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage) correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies. The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been

  lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time. In 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology Frederick J. Taussig wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the U.S. was that "With each decade of the past fifty years the actual and proportionate frequency of this accident [perforation of the uterus] has increased, due, first, to the increase in the number of instrumentally induced abortions; second, to the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives; and, third, to the prevailing tendency to use instruments instead of the finger in emptying the uterus."

  an intact fetus improves surgical safety or for other reasons. Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy. Gravid hysterectomy refers to removal of the whole uterus while still containing the pregnancy. Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&E or induction abortion. First-trimester procedures can generally be performed using local anesthesia, while second-trimester methods may require deep sedation or general anesthesia.

  although multiple possibilities have been suggested. Some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion groups, but lack scientific support. For example, the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively. Major medical and scientific bodies (including the WHO, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Royal College of OBGYN and American Congress of OBGYN) have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer. Position statements of major medical bodies on abortion and breast cancer include: In the past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe.

  Murkowski is pro-abortion rights or 'pro-choice.' She supports non-federally funded embryonic stem cell research, although she has cast significant anti-abortion votes, including ones to ban late-term abortions. She does not want to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and by July 2018, Murkowski was one of three Republican senators, along with Shelley Capito and Susan Collins, who publicly supported keeping the Roe v. Wade decision. Murkowski opposes defunding Planned Parenthood. In 2017, she was one of seven Republicans, including Capito and Collins, who voted against a bill to repeal the ACA without a replacement that also would have defunded Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Murkowski joined Collins, voting with a

  Ojeda self-identifies as pro-life but also stated he supports abortion rights and that he would only nominate judges who likewise shared his support for abortion. In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, "I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life." He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, "a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist’s child". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as "pro-life, with exceptions". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”

  Coleman has campaigned as an anti-abortion candidate since at least 1993. He attributes this position to the death of two of his four children in infancy from a rare genetic disease. He supports limiting stem cell research to adult stem cells and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and in July 2006 voted against lifting restrictions on federal research dollars for new embryonic stem cell lines. Coleman is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports embryonic stem cell research. He voted in favor of legislative intervention to prolong the life of severely brain-damaged Floridian Terri Schiavo. Coleman opposes recognition of same-sex marriages by either the federal or state governments. In his 2002 Senate campaign he pledged support for an amendment to the United States Constitution that

  Harry Reid was anti-abortion and former President Jimmy Carter has expressed his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more pro-life, while former President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi favor abortion rights. Groups such as Democrats for Life of America represent the anti-abortion faction of the party while groups such as EMILY's List represent the abortion rights faction. A Newsweek poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were anti-abortion while a 69% majority was in favor of abortion rights. According to the 2020 Democratic Party platform, "Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion."

  Gardner has said that he is pro-life and that abortion laws should be left up to the states. In 2006, Gardner opposed legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception and proposed an amendment to the Colorado state budget to prohibit the state Medicaid plan from purchasing Plan B emergency contraception. In 2007, he voted against a bill requiring hospitals to inform survivors of a sexual assault of the availability of emergency contraception. In 2012, Gardner co-sponsored the controversial so-called "personhood" legislation titled the Life Begins at Conception Act. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. According to The Denver Post, "Gardner conceded that with

  new position on personhood, he might be accused of flip-flopping simply to make himself more palatable to statewide voters." The nonpartisan Factcheck.org said "It would be clearer to say that Gardner supports efforts to ban abortion that could also ban some forms of birth control. As for his change of position, voters in Colorado should know Gardner still supports a federal bill that would prompt the same concerns over birth control as the state measure he says he rejects on the same grounds." In 2014, Gardner called for over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives and said the birth control pill would be safer and cheaper if it was available over the counter.

  process but by the oppressive conditions of slavery. Most of these women, no doubt, would have expressed their deepest resentment had someone hailed their abortions as a stepping stone toward freedom." This traumatic past has influenced the community to believe that abortions continue to serve as acts of desperation rather than an assertion of a woman's freedom and right to her body. Shirley Chisholm spoke to the debate from a political perspective in 1970. Chisholm described the decriminalization of abortions as a necessary step toward the safety of women. "Experience shows that pregnant women who feel that they have compelling reasons for not having a baby, or another baby, will break the law and even worse, risk injury or death if they must get one. Abortions will not be stopped."

  Democrats opposing the legislation. The Democratic Party opposes attempts to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which declared abortion covered by the constitutionally protected individual right to privacy under the Ninth Amendment; and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which lays out the legal framework in which government action alleged to violate that right is assessed by courts. As a matter of the right to privacy and of gender equality, many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference. They believe that each woman, conferring with her conscience, has the right to choose for herself whether abortion is morally correct. Former Senate Minority

['In a heartfelt monologue on his show Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel opened up about his newborn son, Billy, who underwent emergency open-heart surgery just three hours after he was born.\nKimmel, who has been open about his son\'s health issues since Billy was born, revealed that the surgery was necessary because of a heart defect that doctors discovered while his wife, Molly McNearney, was 31 weeks pregnant.\n"The first couple of days were touch and go," Kimmel said. "They were monitoring his heart, and they found he had a congenital heart disease, which is where the pulmonary valve is partially blocked, which is common, and they open the valve, but by the time they operated on him, the valve was so severely compromised that the chance of fixing it with surgery was less than 50 percent."\nKimmel said that Billy\'s surgery was performed by Dr. Vaughn Starnes, a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon at Children\'s Hospital Los Angeles, and that the surgery was a success.\n"He\'s doing great," Kimmel said. "He\'s eating, he\'s sleeping, he\'s peeing, he\'s pooping, he\'s doing all the things that he\'s supposed to do. He\'s gaining weight, and he\'', 'Regarding the surgery that saved Jimmy Kimmel\'s son, "Medicaid has stopped providing this kind of service.']

Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the "Jimmy Kimmel test" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system. Kimmel plays the bass clarinet, and was a guest performer at a concert in Costa Mesa, California, on July 20, 2008, featuring The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, performing with the group on the song "The Impression That I Get".

  Jimmy Kimmel is a practicing Catholic. Kimmel married Gina Maddy in 1988; they divorced in 2002. Their daughter Katherine was born in 1991 and their son Kevin was born in 1993. He had a relationship with comedian Sarah Silverman from 2002 to March 2009. Kimmel started dating Molly McNearney, a co-head writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live, in October 2009. They were engaged in August 2012 and married in July 2013. Their daughter Jane was born in July 2014. Their second child, William ("Billy") John, was born on April 21, 2017. He was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age.

Hours later, ABC officials pulled that night's show from the entire network. Kimmel later apologized. Kimmel usually ends his show with "My apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of time." When Matt Damon did actually appear on the show to be interviewed, he walked in and sat down only to be told just a few seconds later by Kimmel, "Unfortunately, we are totally out of time," followed by "my apologies to Matt Damon." Damon appeared angry but both performers have since indicated that

Later, videos surfaced of Kimmel using racial slurs in a music video. Also, during an interview in 2009 with Megan Fox, Kimmel made a joke in response to Fox speaking out about being sexualized at age 15 by Michael Bay. Kimmel later issued an apology for his actions and for taking a long time to address the criticism. He said, "There is nothing more important to me than your respect, and I apologize to those who were genuinely hurt or offended by the makeup I wore or the

  I spoke." Kimmel explained the blackface was part of a recurring impression of basketball player Karl Malone that continued on The Man Show: "We hired makeup artists to make me look as much like Karl Malone as possible. I never considered that this might be seen as anything other than an imitation of a fellow human being, one that had no more to do with Karl's skin color than it did his bulging muscles and bald head." He also denied that his going on vacation was due to the blackface controversy, saying the vacation had been planned for over a year. He did not address the interview with Megan Fox.

When one of the children suggested "killing all the people in China" as a way of resolving the U.S. debt, Kimmel responded that that was "an interesting idea" and soon jokingly asked a followup: "Should we allow the Chinese to live?" The incident triggered discussions and protests on Internet, even from Mainland China. In an October 25 letter to a group called the 80-20 Initiative, which identifies itself as a pan-Asian-American political organization, ABC apologized for the segment, saying "We would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the Chinese community, Asian community, anyone of Chinese descent or any community at large."

   In January 2003, Kimmel permanently left The Man Show to host his own late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, on ABC. In the April 2007 issue of Stuffmagazine.com, Kimmel was named the "biggest badass on TV". Kimmel said it was an honor but clearly a mistake. Despite its name, the show has not actually aired live since 2004, when censors were unable to properly bleep censor a barrage of swearing from actor Thomas Jane. During the 2004 NBA Finals in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC's halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show.

  to the streets in San Francisco on October 28 to protest the show and demand "a more elaborate apology" and that Kimmel be fired. On that day's broadcast, Kimmel addressed the controversy personally, saying: "I thought it was obvious that I didn't agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn't ... So I just wanted to say, I'm sorry, I apologize." Despite the apologies from ABC and Kimmel, protests continued. A White House petition was created to investigate the incident and reached the 100,000 signatures needed to require a response from the White House. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus denounced the incident and demanded a formal apology from ABC.

['Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica\n\nA new study published in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine has found that pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) can provide significant pain relief for patients with acute back pain and sciatica.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, involved 100 patients with acute back pain and sciatica. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either PRF or conventional radiofrequency (CRF) treatment.\n\nThe results showed that the PRF group experienced significantly greater pain relief than the CRF group. The PRF group also had fewer complications and required fewer follow-up procedures.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. David Hanscom, explained that PRF works by heating up the nerve tissue in the affected area, which can help to reduce pain and inflammation.\n\n"Pulsed radiofrequency is a relatively new technique that has shown promising results in clinical trials," said Dr. Hanscom.

  Immediate though temporary relief of piriformis syndrome can usually be brought about by injection of a local anaesthetic into the piriformis muscle. Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though the use of such medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities such as running, bicycling, rowing, heavy lifting, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal physical therapy, including soft tissue mobilization, hip joint mobilization, teaching stretching techniques, and strengthening of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and biceps femoris to reduce strain on the piriformis.

The same review also found that acupuncture is not more effective than conventional therapy and other alternative medicine treatments. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that, for neck pain, acupuncture was comparable in effectiveness to conventional treatment, while electroacupuncture was even more effective in reducing pain than was conventional acupuncture. The same review noted that "It is difficult to draw conclusion [sic] because the included studies have a high risk of bias and imprecision."

  Treatment can vary based on the nature and severity of the disease. A compressed nerve root can cause radicular pain with or without radiculopathy. Most of the time, symptoms from a compressed nerve will start to feel better within 6 to 12 weeks of nonsurgical treatment. To unlock the nerve root in the acute phase, it is recommended to apply traction and isometric muscle relaxation, and should be the first procedure to be performed in cases of severe pain. In cases where manipulation is undesirable or impossible to carry out, the infiltration may be root. Anti-inflammatory medications may be used to alleviate symptoms. In the acute setting, the main goal is to restore proper mobility by reducing pain. Surgery is used when other methods do not produce results, except when paralysis is observed; in those cases, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to avoid irreversible paralysis of muscles.

Acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single-use needles. When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. Accidents and infections do occur, though, and are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner, particularly in the application of sterile techniques. A review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade. The

Physical Therapists may suggest stretching exercises that will target the piriformis, but may also include the hamstrings and hip muscles in order to adequately reduce pain and increase range of motion. Patients with piriformis syndrome may also find relief from applications of ice which will help reduce inflammation and so may help limit pressure on the sciatic nerve. This treatment can be helpful when pain starts or immediately after an activity that is likely to cause pain. As the length of time progresses, heat may provide temporary relief from many types of muscle pain and will temporarily increase muscle flexibility.

Tendons and ligaments play an active role in maintain joint stability and controls the limits of joint movements, once injured tendons and ligaments detrimentally impact motor functions. Continuous exercise or movement of a musculoskeletal injury can result in chronic inflammation with progression to permanent damage or disability. In many cases, during the healing period after a musculoskeletal injury, a period in which the healing area will be completely immobile, a cast-induced muscle atrophy can occur. Routine sessions of physiotherapy after the cast is removed can help return strength in limp muscles or tendons. Alternately, there exist different methods of electrical stimulation of

  The Meningitis Vaccine Project is an effort to eliminate the meningitis epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa by developing a new meningococcal vaccine. The meningitis problem in that area is caused by a strain of meningitis called "meningitis A", which is present only in the African meningitis belt. In June 2010 various sources announced that they had developed MenAfriVac, which is an inexpensive, safe, and highly effective vaccine which is likely to stop the epidemic as quickly as anyone had ever hoped that it would. The project marked the first time that medical research had developed a vaccine to combat a disease which is endemic to and only a problem for Africa. The project began in 2001 when the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded the World Health Organization and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) a US $70 million seed grant to begin research.

  In 1973, one particular case brought attention to the issue of forced sterilization. Twelve-year-old Minnie Lee Relf was sterilized without her consent or consent of a parent in a federally funded Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) health clinic—the Montgomery Family Planning Clinic—in Montgomery, Alabama. The official plaintiff was Katie Relf, the sister of Minnie Lee, and the defendant was Caspar Weinberger, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The crux of the case challenged a state eugenics statute that authorized the procedure for "mentally incompetent" individuals without requiring the girl's consent or that of a guardian. Caseworkers had diagnosed Minnie Lee as mentally retarded and thus were able to apply the statute, although the basis for their diagnosis was extremely questionable. As a result both Minnie Lee and

Claim: The government "knowingly" injected a birth defect-inducing vaccine into epidurals between 2010 and 2014 to hurt Black women
Answer: 
2024-06-11 10:07:52 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:This was seen as a major defeat for the black militant notion that government-funded birth control was black genocide. In the US in the 21st century, black people are most likely to be at risk of unintended pregnancy: 84% of black women of reproductive age use birth control, in contrast 

 In 2018, ICAN filed Freedom of information lawsuits to force the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to release administrative reports on childhood vaccine injury HHS is required to file with Congress.

['Japan\'s cautious approach to testing for the new coronavirus has been criticized by some experts, but the government is defending its strategy, saying it is prioritizing testing for those who are most likely to be infected.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Japan had conducted 10,000 tests, according to the health ministry. That\'s a fraction of the number in other countries, such as Germany, which has tested more than 1.5 million people, and the United States, which has tested more than 1.5 million people.\n\nThe government\'s strategy is to focus on testing those who have been in close contact with confirmed cases, as well as medical staff and those who have returned from overseas.\n\n"We are testing those who are most likely to be infected," said Dr. Shigeru Omi, a former vice minister of health, in an interview with NHK. "We are not testing the general population."\n\nThe government\'s approach is based on the fact that Japan has a relatively low number of confirmed cases, with just over 3,000 as of Tuesday.\n\n"We are not seeing a large number of cases in Japan," said Dr. Yoshihiro Kawada, director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. "So we are not testing the general population."\n\nHowever, some experts say Japan\'s testing strategy is too narrow.', 'Japan defends cautious approach on coronavirus testing amid concerns.']

 On 9 June 2021, Japan's public health experts warned that the Tokyo Olympics could help the coronavirus to spread more rapidly. Epidemiologist Hiroshi Nishiura expressed concern that the games could help spread more contagious COVID-19 variants, given the fact that a large numbers of athletes, coaches, officials, media, local volunteers, and domestic spectators would participate in the games. Nishiura said the Japanese health authorities had not assessed the public health impact of holding the games. The majority of the experts were in favour of the cancellation of the Tokyo Games.

The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that "a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing" On 7September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results".

  New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in

  system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment. However, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people

As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak.

A Chinese woman, who was the target of the outburst, immediately left the restaurant.

['Britain has given the go-ahead for a scientist to create the world\'s first genetically modified human embryos, in a move that has been hailed as a "landmark" for medical research.\nThe decision, announced by the UK\'s fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), will allow Professor Kathy Niandi, of the Francis Crick Institute in London, to create embryos with DNA that has been edited using the CRISPR gene-editing tool.\nThe HFEA\'s decision follows a public consultation, which found that 82% of respondents were in favour of the research.\nThe embryos will be created using donated eggs and sperm, and will be destroyed after 14 days.\nThe HFEA\'s decision is a landmark for medical research, as it will allow scientists to study the early stages of human development, and to better understand the genetic basis of disease.\nHowever, it has also been met with controversy, with some critics warning that the technology could be used to create "designer babies" with specific traits, such as height or intelligence.\nProfessor Niandi has previously stated that she has no intention of using the technology to create genetically modified babies, and that her research will be focused on understanding the basic biology of early human development.\nThe', 'Britain gives scientist go-ahead to genetically modify human embryos.']

   Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made

  In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited the willful destruction of human embryos but directed that human embryos could be destroyed if they were more than five years old. The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France. The law prohibited researchers from creating embryos for research but allowed researchers to experiment with embryos that were superfluous after in vitro fertilization.

  Agar has written extensively on the debate about human enhancement and eugenics. His first significant contribution was the 2004 book Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement. In the state-sponsored eugenics defended by the followers of Francis Galton individuals would defer to the state and its experts empowered to impose on all a centrally-determined conception of the good life. Agar argued that a vigorous defense of procreative freedom could turn the morally misguided authoritarian eugenics into a morally defensible liberal eugenics. Agar would encourage prospective parents to consult their own conceptions of the good life to choose some of their children's characteristics. A liberal state should ban choices judged injurious to children's well-being. It would exercise the same kinds of

  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is a species of pathogenic bacteria in the family Mycobacteriaceae and the causative agent of tuberculosis. First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, M. tuberculosis can appear weakly Gram-positive. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope. The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. The M. tuberculosis genome was sequenced in 1998.

The riot exacerbated matters, as ambulances could not get through the crowd to assist. Eventually, the students were able to get a car to the area and took Guihard to Oxford Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The hospital determined that he had

  M. tuberculosis, then known as the "tubercle bacillus", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as "Koch's bacillus". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. This airborne disease is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide, affecting nearly 2 billion people throughout the world currently. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. A contaminated droplet can infect any person and they can become contaminated with M. tuberculosis. They thus become part of the 1.8 billion people worldwide who are currently struggling with this disease.

  Humans are the only known reservoirs of M. tuberculosis. A misconception is that M. tuberculosis can be spread by shaking hands, making contact with toilet seats, sharing food or drink, or sharing toothbrushes. Kissing could be a possible route of transmission if the person is excreting many mycobacteria through the sputum. However, major spread is through air droplets originating from a person who has the disease either coughing, sneezing, speaking, or singing. When in the lungs, M. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, but they are unable to kill and digest the bacterium. Its cell wall prevents the fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome, which contains a host of antibacterial factors.

Guihard and Schulman visited the governor's office, where the Citizens' Council had organized a segregationist rally. They then visited the local Citizens' Council headquarters to interview executive director Louis Hollis. The meeting was friendly and Guihard received Hollis' permission to file a story from the office; this 198-word piece, Guihard's last, called the situation "the gravest Constitutional crisis that the United States has known since the War of Secession" and asserted that the "Civil War never came to an end".

   The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is generally spread when an infected person coughs and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the lungs, but can spread to any part of the body. Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria. But, TB can remain dormant in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. If and when the disease does become active in the body, it can multiply rapidly, causing the person to develop many symptoms including cough (sometimes with blood), night sweats, fever, chest pains, loss of appetite and loss of weight.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of history's greatest killers, taking the lives of over 3 million people annually. It has been called the "white plague". According to the WHO, approximately fifty percent of people infected with TB today live in Asia. It is the most prevalent, life-threatening infection among AIDS patients. It has increased in areas where HIV seroprevalence is high. Air travel and the other methods of travel which have made global interaction easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the BCG vaccine was

  Other bacteria are commonly identified with a microscope by staining them with Gram stain. However, the mycolic acid in the cell wall of M. tuberculosis does not absorb the stain. Instead, acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen stain, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used. Cells are curved rod-shaped and are often seen wrapped together, due to the presence of fatty acids in the cell wall that stick together. This appearance is referred to as cording, like strands of cord that make up a rope. M. tuberculosis is characterized in tissue by caseating granulomas containing Langhans giant cells, which have a "horseshoe" pattern of nuclei.

  M. tuberculosis blocks the bridging molecule, early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1); however, this blockade does not prevent fusion of vesicles filled with nutrients. Consequently, the bacteria multiply unchecked within the macrophage. The bacteria also carry the UreC gene, which prevents acidification of the phagosome. In addition, production of the diterpene isotuberculosinol prevents maturation of the phagosome. The bacteria also evades macrophage-killing by neutralizing reactive nitrogen intermediates. More recently, M. tuberculosis  has been shown to secrete and cover itself in 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), a special nucleoside that acts as an antacid, allowing it to neutralize pH and induce swelling in lysosomes. 1-TbAd is encoded by the gene Rv3378c.

  San Luis Obispo, California, became the first city in the world to restrict indoor smoking in bars as well as in restaurants. The ban did not include workplaces, but covered all other indoor public spaces and its enforcement was somewhat limited. In the United States, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. California's ban included a controversial restriction upon smoking in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban. Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place

The spaces most commonly affected by smoking bans are indoor workplaces and buildings open to the public such as restaurants, bars, office buildings, schools, retail stores, hospitals, libraries, transport facilities, and government buildings, in addition to public transport vehicles such as aircraft, buses, watercraft, and trains. However, laws may also prohibit smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, pedestrian plazas, college and hospital campuses, and within a certain distance from the entrance to a building. The most common rationale cited for restrictions on smoking is the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoke (SHS), or the inhalation of tobacco smoke by persons who are not smoking.

  as cigars to avoid the ban. A 2016 analysis of data from the 1999–2013 National Youth Tobacco Surveys suggests that the ban reduced adolescent cigarette use—both probability of smoking a cigarette and number of cigarettes used by smokers—although there was an increase in adolescent use of menthols, smokeless tobacco, flavored cigars, and pipes, suggesting substitution towards the remaining legal flavored tobacco products. That said, the ban was associated with a reduction in overall tobacco product use by youth of 6.1 percent. Canada banned flavored additives in combustible tobacco products—cigarettes, little cigars, and rolling papers—in 2009, excluding menthol. Canada banned menthol cigarettes

The Pacific island of Niue hopes to become the next country to prohibit the sale of tobacco. A proposal in Iceland would ban tobacco sales from shops, making it prescription-only and therefore dispensable only in pharmacies on doctor's orders. New Zealand hopes to achieve being tobacco-free by 2025 and Finland by 2040. In 2012, anti-smoking groups proposed a 'smoking licence' – if a smoker managed to quit and hand back their licence, they would get back any money

September 4, 2019, Michigan became the first state in the nation to ban flavored e-cigarettes. In November 2018 the FDA announced its intention to outlaw menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, and to limit sales of e-cigarettes with flavors other than mint, tobacco, and menthol to qualified adults-only stores and online.

  In the US, smokers and hospitality businesses initially argued that businesses would suffer from no-smoking laws. However, a 2006 review by the U.S. Surgeon General found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars might see increased business. In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law to include virtually all restaurants and bars, including those in private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, one of the toughest in the United States. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the

  in that year. In June 2018, San Francisco residents voted to outlaw the sale of flavored tobacco products, including e-liquids and menthol cigarettes, in the city. The measure, Proposition E, passed with 68.5 percent of the vote, in spite of Big Tobacco company R.J. Reynolds spending more than $12 million on ads against the measure. The ban was supported by groups including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, African American American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, and Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund. Similar bans have passed in California in the cities of Oakland and Sonoma as well

  residential homes. More than 20 cities in California enacted park- and beach-smoking restrictions. In May 2011, New York City expanded its previously implemented smoking ban by banning smoking in parks, beaches and boardwalks, public golf courses and other areas controlled by the New York City Parks Department. In recent years New York City has passed administrative codes §17-502 and §17-508 forcing landlords of privately owned buildings, cooperatives, and condominiums to adopt a smoking policy into all leases. These codes oblige landlords to enact provisions telling tenants the exact locations where they can or can not smoke. In January 2010, the mayor of Boston, Massachusetts,

  The study also found the city's restaurants and bars prospered despite the smoke-free law, with increases in jobs, liquor licenses, and business tax payments. The president of the New York Nightlife Association remarked that the study was not wholly representative, as by not differentiating between restaurants and nightclubs, the reform may have caused businesses like nightclubs and bars to suffer instead. A 2006 study by the New York State Department of Health found that "the CIAA has not had any significant negative financial effect on restaurants and bars in either the short or the long term". In Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, three restaurants received short-term exemptions from a local smoke-free ordinance in restaurants when they managed to demonstrate financial suffering because of it.

We don't want that,” says Dr. Ashley Bloomfield, director-general of health.\n\nThe country's health ministry reported 1,250 new cases on Tuesday, the highest number since the pandemic began. The country's seven-day rolling average of new cases is now 1,000, up from 500 a week ago.\n\nThe surge is being driven by the highly infectious Delta variant, which now makes up 99% of all new cases.\n\nThe majority of the new cases are in Auckland, the country's largest city, which has been in lockdown since August 17. The lockdown was initially set to end on September 3, but has been extended until at least September 26.\n\nThe government has also announced that the country's border will remain closed to most non-citizens and non-residents until at least November.\n\nThe surge in cases has led to a shortage of hospital beds and staff, with some hospitals reporting that they are at or near capacity.\n\nThe government has announced that it will be deploying additional medical staff to the hardest-hit areas, and that it will be building field hospitals to help alleviate the pressure on hospitals.\n\nThe surge in cases has also led to a back", "The coronavirus has seen a “big surge in New Zealand.

['A new study has found that breast-feeding may help protect premature babies from developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a potentially blinding eye disease.\nResearchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that babies who were breast-fed for at least two months had a 40 percent lower risk of developing ROP, compared to those who were fed formula or breast-milk for less than two months.\nROP is a complication of prematurity that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It can cause scarring and abnormal blood vessel growth, which can lead to vision loss or blindness.\nThe study, which was published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology, included 1,200 infants born before 32 weeks of gestation at UCSF between 2006 and 2011. The researchers followed the infants for up to three years and assessed their risk of developing ROP.\nThe study found that 22 percent of the infants who were breast-fed for less than two months developed ROP, compared to 14 percent of those who were breast-fed for at least two months.\nThe researchers also found that the longer the infants were breast-fed, the lower their risk of developing ROP. Infants who were breast-fed for at least four months had a ', 'Breast-Feeding Linked to Reduced Risk of Preemie Eye Problem']

Since breastfeeding studies are, for ethical reasons, never conducted as randomized controlled trials, critics have repeatedly suspected that studies may have produced the superiority of breastfeeding as an artifact. Both the physical, emotional and mental development of children and the preferences of women for a feeding method are strongly determined by socioeconomical factors such as the mother's ethnicity, social class, and education.

  Adequate nutrition during infancy is crucial for child survival, optimal growth and development throughout life. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS,

  William Sears argues that breastfeeding greatly accommodates mother-child-attachment because it triggers the release of oxytocin in the mother which supports her emotional bonding with the child, notably in the first ten days after childbirth. In opposition to bottle feeding which tends to being done in three to four hour intervals, breastfeeding enables the mother, too, to perceive the child's moods and needs exactly. Since the half-life period of the hormones prolactin and oxytocin (which promote bonding) are very short, Sears recommends to breastfeed very frequently, newborns in particular (8 to 12 times a day). He claims that the hours between 1 am and 6 am are the most beneficial for breastfeeding. In general, Sears argues

  effects of socioeconomical factors. A loophole from this problem was first presented by Cynthia G. Colen (Ohio State University), who successfully factored out socioeconomical determinants by comparing siblings only; her study demonstrated that formula fed children showed only minimal differences to their breastfed siblings, insofar as their physical, emotional and mental thriving was concerned. William Sears' assumptions about the benefit of breastfeeding for the attachment have been studied. In 2006, John R. Britton and a research team (Kaiser Permanente) found that highly sensitive mothers are more likely than less sensitive mothers to breastfeed and to breastfeed over a long time period. However, the study showed no effect of the feeding method on the attachment quality.

Due to their relative ease of production, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are a subject of particular interest in supplementation and intervention. A Cochrane review in 2020 found low- to moderate-quality evidence that supplementation of probiotics enterally "prevents severe NEC, as well as all-cause mortality in preterm infants" and that further high-quality trials are needed to inform policy and practice. Advancing enteral feed volumes at lower rates does not appear to reduce the risk of NEC or death in very preterm infants and seems to increase the risk of invasive infection.

2024-06-11 10:10:05 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Prevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding "significant short- and long-term beneficial effects," including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Since breastfeeding studies are, for ethical reasons, never conducted as randomized controlled trials, critics have repeatedly suspected that studies may have produced the superiority of breastfeeding as an artifact. Both the physical, emotional and mental development of children and the preferences of women for a feeding method are strongly determined by socioeconomical factors such as the mother's ethnicity, social class, and education. Not beginning feeding an infant by mouth for more than 4 days does not appear to have protective benefits.

['A new study has found that robotic surgeries are more expensive than traditional surgeries, but they are also safer.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, compared the costs and outcomes of robotic-assisted surgeries and traditional surgeries for 1,000 patients who underwent surgery for early-stage prostate cancer.\n\nThe researchers found that the robotic surgeries cost an average of $14,000 more than traditional surgeries, but they were associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stays.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. David Penson, a professor of urology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that the higher costs of robotic surgeries are due to the cost of the robotic equipment and the longer operating times.\n\nHowever, he said that the benefits of robotic surgeries, such as fewer complications and shorter hospital stays, can result in lower overall costs for patients and the healthcare system.\n\nThe study\'s senior author, Dr. Christine H. Lee, a professor of surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, said that the results of the study suggest that robotic surgeries should be considered a viable option for patients with early-stage prostate cancer.\n\n"Our study shows that robotic-assisted surgery is associated with fewer complications and', 'Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study']

  Major advances aided by surgical robots have been remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification help to result in improved ergonomics. Due to these techniques, there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions, and use of pain medication. The existing open surgery technique has many flaws such as limited access to the surgical area, long recovery time, long hours of operation, blood loss, surgical scars, and marks. The robot's costs range from $1 million to $2.5 million for

The memory storage solutions can perform multiple functions based on the patient’s physical record. They can also indicate specific information to measure calibration offsets indicating misalignment of the storage drive system, life of the data, and so on. Robotic surgery has been criticized for its expense, with the average costs in 2007 ranging from $5,607 to $45,914 per patient. This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear.

  unit, and while its disposable supply cost is normally $1,500 per procedure, the cost of the procedure is higher. Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system. Numerous feasibility studies have been done to determine whether the purchase of such systems are worthwhile. As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must perform 150 to 250 procedures to become adept in their use. During the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie-ups and surgical staffs keeping patients

Articles in the newly created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon's experience. Complications related to robotic surgeries range from converting the surgery to open, re-operation, permanent injury, damage to viscera and nerve damage.

  are also current methods of robotic surgery being marketed and advertised online. Removal of a cancerous prostate has been a popular treatment through internet marketing. Internet marketing of medical devices are more loosely regulated than pharmaceutical promotions. Many sites that claim the benefits of this type of procedure had failed to mention risks and also provided unsupported evidence. There is an issue with government and medical societies promotion a production of balanced educational material. In the US alone, many websites promotion robotic surgery fail to mention any risks associated with these types of procedures, and hospitals providing materials largely ignore risks, overestimate benefits and are strongly influenced by the manufacturer.

  anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they chose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved outcomes, reduced blood loss and less pain. Higher expectations may explain higher rates of dissatisfaction and regret. Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. In addition, surgeons no longer have to stand throughout the surgery and do not get tired as quickly. Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams. Laparoscopic camera positioning is also significantly steadier with

  Robotic surgery in the field of urology has become common, especially in the United States. There is inconsistent evidence of benefits compared to standard surgery to justify the increased costs. Some have found tentative evidence of more complete removal of cancer and fewer side effects from surgery for prostatectomy. In 2000, the first robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed. Robotic surgery has also been utilized in radical cystectomies. A 2013 review found less complications and better short term outcomes when compared to open technique.

  The first report of robotic surgery in gynecology was published in 1999 from the Cleveland Clinic The adoption of robotic surgery has contributed to the increase in minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic disease. Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery and the rate of complications may be higher, but there are not enough high-quality studies to know at the present time. In the United States, robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions was shown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy in 2015, with no difference in overall rates of complications. This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic oncology. Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids, abnormal periods, endometriosis, ovarian tumors, uterine prolapse, and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies. The Memic robotic system is aimed to provide a robotic platform for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for myomectomy through the vagina. A 2017 review of surgical removal of the uterus and cervix for early cervical cancer robotic and laparoscopic surgery resulted in similar outcomes with respect to the cancer.

  injury, nerve damage and visceral damage as well. Very minimal surgeries in a variety of specialties had to actually be converted to open or be re-operated on, but most did suffer some kind of damage and/or injury. For example, out of seven coronary artery bypass grafting, one patient had to go under re-operation. It is important that complications are captured, reported and evaluated to ensure the medical community is better educated on the safety of this new technology. If something was to go wrong in a robot-assisted surgery, it is difficult to identify culpability, and the safety of the practice will influence how quickly and widespread these practices are used.

  Robotic surgery are types of surgical procedures that are done using robotic systems. Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to try to overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally-invasive surgical procedures and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery. In the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to administer the instruments. These include using a direct telemanipulator or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery. The robotic arms carry out those movements using end-effectors and manipulators to perform the actual surgery. In computer-controlled systems, the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these

  Adverse effects of testosterone supplementation may include increased cardiovascular events (including strokes and heart attacks) and deaths based on three peer-reviewed studies involving men taking testosterone replacement. In addition, an increase of 30% in deaths and heart attacks in older men has been reported. Due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial (a National Institute of Aging randomized trial) was halted early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. On January 31, 2014, reports of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths in men taking FDA-approved testosterone-replacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating the issue. Later, in September 2014, the FDA announced, as a result

  Testosterone (T) is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. Women

The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported "the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes."

Over the 3 to 6-month course of the studies reviewed, testosterone therapy appeared safe and generally effective, and (ruling out prostate cancer) the authors found no justification to absolutely restrict its use in men with CHF. A similar 2012 review also found increased exercise capacity and reasoned the benefits generlizable to women. However, both reviews advocate larger, longer term, randomized controlled trials.

  In the US in the 2000s, companies and figures in the popular media have heavily marketed notions of "andropause" as something parallel to menopause; these notions have been rejected by the medical community. Additionally, advertising from drug companies selling testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as dietary supplement companies selling all kinds of "boosters" for aging men, have emphasized the "need" of middle-aged or ageing men for testosterone. There is a medical condition called late-onset hypogonadism; according to Thomas Perls and David J. Handelsman, writing in a 2015 editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, it appears that this condition is overdiagnosed and overtreated. Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, "sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales."

Although testosterone has been found to be effective at improving sexual function in postmenopausal women, the doses employed have been supraphysiological. In contrast to these high doses, there is little support for the notion that testosterone is a critical hormone for sexual desire and function in women under normal physiological circumstances. Low doses of testosterone resulting in physiological levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) have

  testosterone required to increase sexual desire in women may have a significant risk of masculinization with long-term therapy. For this reason, and due to the unknown health effects and safety of testosterone therapy, its use may be inappropriate. In 2003, the FDA rejected Intrinsa, a 300 µg/day testosterone patch for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. The reasons cited were limited efficacy (about one additional sexually satisfying event per month), concerns about safety and potential adverse effects with long-term therapy, and concerns about inappropriate off-label use. It appears that in women, rather than testosterone, estradiol may be the most important hormone

  all ticks are infected. In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease). Other pathogens are much more rare. Ticks can be tested for infection using a highly specific and sensitive qPCR procedure. Several commercial labs provide this service to individuals for a fee. The Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ), a nonprofit lab at the University of Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive TickReport for a variety of human pathogens and makes the data available to the public. Those wishing to know the incidence of tick-borne diseases in their town or state can search the LMZ surveillance database.

  Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). STARI exhibits a rash similar to that caused by Lyme disease, but is generally considered to be less severe. Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. Some evidence indicates A. americanum saliva inactivates B. burgdorferi more quickly than the saliva of Ixodes scapularis. Recently the bacteria Borrelia andersonii and Borrelia americana have been linked to A. americanum. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Six more cases were identified in 2012–2013 in Missouri and Tennessee.

  Ticks tend to be more active during warmer months, though this varies by geographic region and climate. Areas with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Those bitten commonly experience symptoms such as body aches, fever, fatigue, joint pain, or rashes. People can limit their exposure to tick bites by wearing light-colored clothing (including pants and long sleeves), using insect repellent with 20%–30% N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), tucking their pants legs into their socks, checking for ticks frequently, and washing and drying their clothing (in a hot dryer). According to the World Health Organization, tick-to-animal transmission is difficult to prevent because animals do not show visible symptoms; the only effective prevention relies on killing ticks on the livestock production facility.

  Another issue that exists with high deer density is the spreading of infectious diseases. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the country and is found in twelve states in Eastern America. In 2009, it affected more than 38,000 people. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain

  Tick-borne diseases, which afflict humans and other animals, are caused by infectious agents transmitted by tick bites. They are caused by infection with a variety of pathogens, including rickettsia and other types of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Because individual ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent, patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time, compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. 16 tick-borne diseases of humans are known, of which four have been discovered since 2013. As the incidence of tick-borne illnesses increases and the geographic areas in which they are found expand, health workers increasingly must be able to distinguish the diverse, and often overlapping, clinical presentations of these diseases. Several high-profile deaths have been caused by the tick–human transmission of disease, including the death of former Senator Kay Hagan in the United States in 2019 at the age of 66.

  For a person or pet to acquire a tick-borne disease requires that the individual gets bitten by a tick and that the tick feeds for a sufficient period of time. The feeding time required to transmit pathogens differs for different ticks and different pathogens. Transmission of the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is well understood to require a substantial feeding period. In general, soft ticks (Argasidae) transmit pathogens within minutes of attachment because they feed more frequently, whereas hard ticks (Ixodidae) take hours or days, but the latter are more common and harder to remove. For an individual to acquire infection, the feeding tick must also be infected.

  First signs or symptoms can occur about three to six days after the initial tick bite, although it can have incubation periods of up to 20 days. Patients usually experience a two-staged fever and illness which can continue for three days, diminish, and then return for another episode of one to three days. The virus has the ability to live in the bloodstream for up to 120 days; therefore, coming in contact without proper precautions and the donation of blood are prohibited. Initial symptoms include fever, chills, headaches, pain behind the eyes, light sensitivity, muscle pain, generalized malaise, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly,

The Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ), a nonprofit lab at the University of Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive TickReport for a variety of human pathogens and makes the data available to the public.

["Missouri is facing a growing number of measles cases, with 10 confirmed cases and 10 suspected cases reported as of March 22, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.\nThe state's first confirmed case was reported on March 11, and the department has since confirmed nine more cases. The suspected cases are pending confirmation.\nThe department is urging Missourians to get vaccinated against measles, which is highly contagious and can cause serious complications, including hospitalization and death.\nThe department is also working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed to measles, and is providing guidance to health care providers and schools.\nMissouri's measles outbreak is part of a larger national trend. As of March 22, there have been 159 confirmed cases of measles in 10 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe outbreaks are largely linked to travelers who brought the virus back to the United States from other countries, where measles is still common.\nMissouri's vaccination rates are below the national average, which can contribute to outbreaks. According to the department, 94.5 percent of kindergarten students in Missouri received at least one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine in the 2017-2018 school year.\nThe national average", 'Missouri faces vaccination hesitancy amid measles case.']

May 2017 saw a return of measles to the US after an outbreak in Minnesota among unvaccinated children. Another outbreak occurred in the state of New York between 2018 and 2019, causing over 200 confirmed measles cases in mostly ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in New Jersey and Washington state with over 30 cases reported in the Pacific Northwest. The WHO European region missed its elimination target of 2010

  Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus spread by contact with infected oral and nasal fluids. When a person with measles coughs or sneezes, he releases microscopic particles into the air. During the 4- to 12-day incubation period, an infected individual shows no symptoms, but as the disease progresses, the following symptoms appear: runny nose, cough, red eyes, extremely high fever and a rash. Measles is an endemic disease, meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance. In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox. Two years later measles was responsible for

In 2005, a global target was agreed for a 90% reduction in measles deaths by 2010 from the 757,000 deaths in 2000 (later updated to 95% by 2015). Estimates in 2008 showed a 78% decline to 164,000 deaths, further declining to 145,700 in 2013. however, progress has since stalled since and both the 2010 and 2015 target were missed: in 2018, still over 140,000 deaths were reported.

In 2018, 84,000 cases were reported in the European region (an increase from 25,000 in 2017); with the majority of cases originating from Ukraine. As of 2018, 35 countries out of 53 European countries have eliminated endemic measles and two additional ones that have interrupted transmission; with four countries re-establishing transmission in 2018.

Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. According to the National Immunization Program, 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15, acquiring immunity to further outbreaks. Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox. Vaccination reduced the number of reported occurrences by 98%. Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite Hispanic and African American children under 5 years old. In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States. The majority of cases that occur are among immigrants from other countries.

Europe had set a goal to eliminate measles transmission by 2010, which was missed due to the MMR vaccine controversy and by low uptake in certain groups, and despite achieving low levels by 2008, European countries have since experienced a small resurgence in cases. The Eastern Mediterranean also had goals to eliminate measles by 2010 (later revised to 2015), the Western Pacific aims to eliminate the disease by 2012, and in 2009 the regional committee for Africa agreed a goal of measles elimination by 2020.

  As of 2018, all six WHO regions have goals to eliminate measles, and at the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010, delegates agreed to move towards eventual eradication, although no specific global target date has yet been agreed. The Americas set a goal in 1994 to eliminate measles and rubella transmission by 2000, and successfully achieved to reduce cases from over 250,000 in 1990 to only 105 cases in 2003. However, while eradication in the Americas was certified in 2015, the certification was lost in 2018 due to endemic measle transmission in Venezuela and subsequent spread to Brazil and Colombia; while additional limited

  World Immunization Week is a global public health campaign to raise awareness and increase rates of immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases around the world. It takes place each year during the last week of April. Immunization can protect against 25 different infectious agents or diseases, from infancy to old age, including diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio, tetanus and COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates active immunization currently averts 2 to 3 million deaths every year. However 22.6 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines, mostly in developing countries. Inadequate immunization coverage rates often result from limited resources, competing health priorities, poor management of health systems

  President Obama's office released a statement that said that the Administration "supports enhancing, simplifying, and making permanent the Research and Experimentation Credit... and offsetting the cost by closing tax loopholes," but that it "strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4438, which would permanently extend and expand the R&D credit without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits." The National Taxpayers Union (NTU) "urged" Representatives to vote in favor of the bill because it "would simplify and make permanent the 20 percent tax credit for research and development expenses." The NTU argued that making this tax credit permanent was "an important step toward creating a healthier business climate, providing broad-based relief, and promoting economic growth." The NTU also argued that it was important for

  The Heroes Act includes about $1.13 trillion of emergency supplemental appropriations to federal agencies, as well as economic assistance to governments at the state, local, tribal, and territorial levels. There would be about $485 billion in safety net spending, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, increased funding utilities payments and job training for low-income individuals, and a 25% increase in aid to disabled veterans. There would be about $435 billion for additional rebates, which would include an additional $1200 stimulus check per individual. There would be about $382 billion for health care, which would include reimbursing health care providers for lost revenue, covering the COBRA premium costs

  Jones article suggests many of these unaccompanied children are attempting to escape abusive situations. Analysis of Border Patrol statistics shows a correlation between gang-related killing of children in Central America, particularly San Pedro Sula in Honduras, and the surge in migration. The bill would provide $2.7 billion in supplemental funding, about $1 billion less than the $3.7 billion requested by President Obama. President Obama supported the bill anyway, despite the lower funding amount. According to the administration, "this bill responsibly addresses the humanitarian situation without injecting partisan provisions that are unworkable and would increase costs without solving the problem." The Administration compared this bill favorably with the House bill "Making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014 (H.R. 5230; 113th Congress)".

  The Council for Exceptional Children, the National Center for Learning Disabilities, and the Higher Education Consortium for Special Education praised the bill because it "values the critical role of research in developing effective practices to support positive outcomes for children and youth with disabilities." However, according to the organizations, "actual funding amounts listed in the legislation remain inadequate to sufficiently address the nation’s special education research needs. This limited investment, coming as the result of rules adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives intended to rein in spending, is not enough to restore funding and increase the impact of future NCSER and special education research." The Data Quality Campaign (DQC) was in favor of the bill, because it would "permit states to use federal funds to turn their attention to the important task of transforming the data they now collect into useful information and ensuring that key stakeholders have access to this tailored, timely, contextual information." DQC says that it "sees immense value in the ability to link data across early childhood education, K-12, postsecondary, and workforce systems," because it allows researchers to answer more complex questions that require data from multiple sources.

She indicated House Democrats were willing to negotiate reducing the House bill's cost to $2.2 trillion." The White House Coronavirus Task Force was led by Vice President Mike Pence, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Congress appropriated $8.3billion in emergency funding, which Trump signed into law on March 6. In April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate passed $484 billion in relief with most funding going to refill the coffers of the Paycheck Protection Program. Murkowski stated that lawmakers knew they would be underestimating certain areas when passing the Families First Act and CARES Act and that they were aware they "have directed a lot of federal resources and it will require us getting back to work in order to deal with this",

["According to a recent report by the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion research organization, the number of abortions in the United States has dropped to its lowest level since 1973. In 2011, there were 1,056,000 abortions, down from 1,212,000 in 2008.\n\nThis is good news, but it's not all good news. The report also reveals that the abortion rate has increased among women aged 40-44, and that the abortion rate among black women is more than four times higher than the rate among white women.\n\nThe report also reveals that the number of abortions has decreased among women aged 15-19, and that the abortion rate among women aged 20-24 has decreased by 18 percent since 2008.\n\nHowever, the report also reveals that the abortion rate among women aged 25-29 has increased by 10 percent since 2008, and that the abortion rate among women aged 30-34 has increased by 12 percent since 2008.\n\nThe report also reveals that the abortion rate among women aged 35-39 has decreased by 10 percent since 2008, and that the abortion rate among women", 'Abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973.']

  whose statistics were deemed incomplete. An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the birth control pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that "most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women" because minority women "have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR).

  "access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health". Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. , 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it.

  43.8 million having been performed in 2008. The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly

  to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide. The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women per year (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women per year (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and

  As the abortion debate has continued, there has been a surge of Black anti-abortion groups. These organizations believe that the womb is the "most dangerous place for an African-American child." Similar to the views of Marcus Garvey, Black anti-abortionists view the abortion movement as an attack on the African American community as a form of genocide and a push for eugenics. Planned Parenthood and the actions of founder Margaret Sanger have become a focal point for these movements, believing their efforts continue to serve to harm Black women. Black women account for over 28% of abortions yearly, more than any other racial demographic. This statistic accounts for the reality that African American women also experience high unintended pregnancy rates, largely due to lack of access to comprehensive reproductive care, including birth control. African American anti-abortionist ideals threaten the access that Black women have gained to reproductive care, something that is harmful given the high rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs, including HIV, in the Black community. Planned Parenthood services over 360,000 Black women a year with not only safe abortion care, but also affordable contraceptives, breast cancer screenings, and STI detection and treatment.

Abortion providers who were black were prosecuted much more often than white ones were. During this time the Black Panthers printed pamphlets which described abortion as black genocide, expanding on their earlier stance with regard to family planning. However, most minority groups stood in favor of the decriminalization of abortion; The New York Times reported in 1970 that more non-white women than white women died as a result of "crude, illegal abortions".

  14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days.

The revolutionary idea that a black woman might enjoy a full life without ever being a mother was presented in Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin's magazine The Woman's Era. Knowledge was secretly shared among clubwomen regarding how to find practitioners offering illegal medical or traditional abortion services. Working-class black women, who were more often forced into having sex with white men, continued to have a need for birth control and abortions.

Criticisms include the assumption in the Donohue-Levitt study that abortion rates increased substantially since 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v.

Other critics state that the correlations between births and crime found by Donohue–Levitt do not adequately account for confounding factors such as reduced drug use, changes in demographics and population densities, or other contemporary cultural changes.

Planned Parenthood services over 360,000 Black women a year with not only safe abortion care, but also affordable contraceptives, breast cancer screenings, and STI detection and treatment. are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven. Criticisms include the assumption in the Donohue-Levitt study that abortion rates increased substantially since 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade eliminated many restrictions in the United States; critics use census data to show that the changes in the overall abortion rate could not account for the decrease in crime claimed by the study's methodology (legal abortions had been permitted under limited circumstances in many states prior). During this time the Black Panthers printed pamphlets which described abortion as black genocide, expanding on their earlier stance with regard to family planning. A poll in Buffalo, 

 York, conducted by the National Organization for Women (NOW), found that 75% of blacks supported the decriminalization of abortion. Johnson cast the issue as one which polarized the black community along gender lines: black women generally viewed abortion as a "blessing in disguise" but black men such as Reverend Jesse Jackson viewed it as black genocide.

['A new blood test could help predict if a pregnancy is at risk for premature labor, according to a new study.\nThe test, which measures the levels of 10 proteins in the blood, could help doctors identify women who are at risk for preterm labor, which can lead to serious health problems for babies.\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, followed 100 women who were at risk for preterm labor. The researchers found that the blood test was able to accurately predict which women would go into labor early.\nThe test is still in the experimental stage, but the researchers hope that it will eventually become a routine part of prenatal care.\nPreterm labor is a major health problem, affecting about 10 percent of all pregnancies. Babies born too early are at risk for a number of health problems, including respiratory distress, brain damage, and cerebral palsy.\nThe new blood test could help doctors identify women who are at risk for preterm labor early on in their pregnancy, allowing for earlier intervention and potentially better outcomes for the babies.\nThe researchers say that the test could also help doctors identify women who may benefit from preventative measures, such as bed rest or medication, to help prevent preterm labor.\nThe study is just the latest in a series of recent breakthroughs in the field of prenatal care. In recent years, researchers have developed new tests that', 'This Blood Test Could Help Predict If A Pregnancy Is At Risk For Premature Labor']

  Medical testing and care can be performed in order to prevent intrauterine hypoxia, though can be difficult. These tests don't directly detect hypoxia, but instead detects the general well-being of the baby and ensures that the baby is healthy since hypoxia causes a wide range of responses. These tests can include prenatal testing, such as fetal movement and amniotic fluid levels, Doppler examination, or fetal heart rate. Another risk factor is premature birth in which medical intervention, such as premature birth prevention or C-section delivery, can be used as prevention for intrauterine hypoxia. Studies have shown a connection between tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency and hypoxia-ischemia brain injury, though further studies need to be done. Measuring fetal BH4 levels can be another way to look out for intrauterine hypoxia. During birth, birth asphyxia can occur in which cardiotocograph can be used to monitor the baby's health during labor.

  Antepartum bleeding (APH), also prepartum hemorrhage, is bleeding during pregnancy from the 24th week (sometimes defined as from the 20th week ) gestational age up to the birth of the baby. The primary consideration is the presence of a placenta previa which is a low lying placenta at or very near to the internal cervical os. This condition occurs in roughly 4 out of 1000 pregnancies and usually needs to be resolved by delivering the baby via cesarean section. Also a placental abruption (in which there is premature separation of the placenta) can lead to obstetrical hemorrhage, sometimes concealed. This pathology is of important consideration after maternal trauma such as a motor vehicle accident or fall. Other considerations to include when assessing antepartum bleeding are: sterile vaginal exams that are performed in order to assess dilation of the patient when the 40th week is approaching. As well as cervical insufficiency defined as a midtrimester (14th-26th week) dilation of the cervix which may need medical intervention to assist in keeping the pregnancy sustainable.

  doing some activities. In dogs, this pain can significantly affect quality of life and may include difficulty going up and down stairs, struggling to get up after lying down, trouble walking on slick floors, being unable to hop in and out of vehicles, difficulty jumping on and off furniture, and behavioral changes (e.g., aggression, difficulty squatting to toilet). Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, knee and hip. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. The strongest predictor of osteoarthritis is increased age, likely due to the declining ability of chondrocytes to maintain the structural integrity of cartilage. More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65. Other risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.

  Further research is required to determine if transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain. Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Evidence of benefit is tentative. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. The FDA has not approved PEMFT for the treatment of arthritis. In Canada, PEMF devices are legally licensed by Health Canada for the treatment of pain associated with arthritic conditions.

  Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It affects humans and other animals, notably dogs, but also occurs in cats and horses. It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body. In humans, this includes the hands, wrists, feet, back, hip, and knee. In dogs, this includes the elbow, hip, stifle (knee), shoulder, and back. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint; however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one

  Musculoskeletal injury refers to damage of muscular or skeletal systems, which is usually due to a strenuous activity. In one study, roughly 25% of approximately 6300 adults received a musculoskeletal injury of some sort within 12 months—of which 83% were activity-related. Musculoskeletal injury spans into a large variety of medical specialties including orthopedic surgery (with diseases such as arthritis requiring surgery), sports medicine, emergency medicine (acute presentations of joint and muscular pain) and rheumatology (in rheumatological diseases that affect joints such as rheumatoid arthritis). Musculoskeletal injuries can affect any part of the human body including; bones, joints, cartilages, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and other soft tissues. Symptoms include mild to severe aches, low back pain, numbness, tingling, atrophy and weakness. These injuries are a

  Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. All arthritides potentially feature pain. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. Rheumatoid arthritis is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness lasting over 30 minutes. However, in the early stages, patients may have no symptoms after a warm shower. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, tends to be associated with morning stiffness which eases relatively quickly with movement and exercise. In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient

['A new study has found that partial knee replacements are better than full knee replacements for many patients.\nThe study, published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, found that partial knee replacements were associated with less pain, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays than full knee replacements.\nPartial knee replacements are typically used for patients with osteoarthritis in only one or two compartments of the knee, while full knee replacements are used for patients with osteoarthritis in all three compartments of the knee.\nThe study analyzed data from over 1,000 patients who underwent either a partial or full knee replacement. The patients were followed for up to 10 years after their surgery.\nThe researchers found that patients who underwent partial knee replacements had less pain and less blood loss than those who underwent full knee replacements. They also had shorter hospital stays and were less likely to require blood transfusions.\nHowever, the study also found that patients who underwent full knee replacements had better outcomes in terms of function and quality of life.\nThe researchers suggest that the decision to undergo a partial or full knee replacement should be based on the patient\'s individual needs and preferences.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. David J.

If the prosthetic foot is rotating at heel strike, the cause is likely a poor socket fit or rotation. This is fixed by adjusting the socket. Lower limb amputations effect a person's energy cost for being mobile. To keep their oxygen consumption rate similar to people without lower limb amputations, they need to walk slower. People in this class use around 87% more oxygen to walk or run the same distance as some one without a lower limb amputation. Because of the potential for balance issues related to having an amputation, during weight training, amputees are encouraged to use a spotter when lifting more than 15 lb.

  Amotivational syndrome is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by signs that are linked to cognitive and emotional states such as detachment, blunted emotion and drives, executive functions like memory and attention, disinterest, passivity, apathy, and a general lack of motivation. This syndrome can be branched into two subtypes - marijuana amotivational syndrome, interchangeably known as cannabis induced amotivational syndrome which is caused by usage and/or dependency of the substance and is primarily associated with long-term effects of cannabis use, and SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome or SSRI-induced apathy caused by the intake of SSRI medication dosage. According to the Handbook of Clinical Psychopharmacology for Therapists, amotivational syndrome is listed as a possible side effect of SSRIs in the treatment of clinical depression.

It is one of the major complications of chronic exposure to cannabis as it includes the effects and elements of cognitive deficit or cognitive impairment that are similar to what appears in schizophrenia and depression. It is characterized by a gradual detachment and disconnect from the outer world due to a loss of emotional reactivity, drives, and aims. Responsiveness to any stimuli is limited, and those affected are unable to experience or anticipate any pleasure except through the use of cannabis.

  The term amotivational syndrome was first devised to understand and explain the diminished drive and desire to work or compete among the population of youth who are frequent consumers of cannabis and has since been researched through various methodological studies with this focus on cannabis, or marijuana. Cannabis amotivational syndrome is often used interchangeably with marijuana amotivational syndrome and marijuana or cannabis induced or related amotivational syndrome. Cannabis related amotivational syndrome is closely tied with cannabis use disorder which is recognized in the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and has similar conditions such as withdrawing and giving up from daily activities

  On October 20, 2011, the Louisiana State University football program announced that it had suspended three players, including star cornerback Tyrann Mathieu, who tested positive for synthetic cannabinoids. In the autumn of 2014, more than two-thousand Spice consumers in Russia sought medical attention, one-thousand were admitted to hospitals, and 40 people died. On July 12, 2016, 33 people were intoxicated by an herbal "incense" product called "AK-47 24 Karat Gold," and dozens overdosed, in Brooklyn. 18 people were transported to local hospitals. The herbal "incense" product was determined to be a synthetic cannabinoid called AMB-FUBINACA.

  On May 24, 2007 the DEA along with the Federal Government and federal prosecutor James Hagerty filed a subpoena for the medical records of 17 individuals, 14 of which were patients who had received medical marijuana permits from a THCF clinic. Eleven of the patients who were named in the subpoena were legally registered patients with the State of Oregon's Department of Human Services medical marijuana program. The subpoena demanded that the State of Oregon turn over the THCF patients’ private medical records to the government. Eventually a federal judge sided with THCF and the State of Oregon and granted a motion to quash both subpoenas. "Absent a further showing of necessity and relevance, compliance with the subpoena would impact significant State and medical privacy interests and is unreasonable," wrote Judge Robert H. Whaley of the U.S. Court Eastern District of Washington.

  Because they activate the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, many of the effects of synthetic cannabinoids are similar to those of THC. These are achieved at lower doses, because many synthetic cannabinoids are more potent than marijuana, and users are often unaware of exactly what they are getting and how potent it is. For example, Δ<sup href="CNS depression">9 -THC has an EC50 of 250 nM at CB<sub href="Tetrahydrocannabinol">1 and 1157 nM at CB 2, whereas PB-22 has an EC<sub href="epileptic seizure">50  of 5.1 nM at CB1 and 37 nM at CB<sub href="full agonists">2.

["Kenya's Ministry of Health has issued a warning to the public about a new outbreak of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can cause cancer. The ministry has warned that the virus, which is spread through kissing, is deadlier than HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe outbreak has been reported in several counties, including Nairobi, Kisumu, and Nakuru. According to the ministry, the number of cases has increased by 50% in the last year.\n\nHPV is a common virus that affects both men and women. It is usually spread through sexual contact, but it can also be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. The virus can cause genital warts and, in some cases, can lead to cancer.\n\nThe ministry has urged the public to take precautions to prevent the spread of HPV. This includes using condoms during sexual activity, getting vaccinated against HPV, and avoiding close contact with people who have the virus.\n\nThe ministry has also called on healthcare workers to increase their awareness of HPV and to provide education and screening services to the public.\n\nThe warning comes at a time when Kenya is grappling with a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. According to the ministry, there are currently over 1.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the country.\n\nThe ministry has urged the public to take the HPV", 'Authorities in Kenya warned of a new outbreak of HPV that spreads through kissing and is deadlier than HIV/Aids.']

  The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) claimed in 2006 that more than 16 percent of adults in Kenya are HIV-infected. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) cites the much lower figure of 6.7 percent. Despite politically charged disputes over the numbers, however, the Kenyan government recently declared HIV/AIDS a national disaster. In 2004 the Kenyan Ministry of Health announced that HIV/AIDS had surpassed malaria and tuberculosis as the leading disease killer in the country. Due largely to AIDS, life expectancy in Kenya has dropped by about a decade. Since 1984 more than 1.5 million Kenyans have died because of HIV/AIDS. In 2017, the number

Estimates of the incidence of infection differ widely. The life expectancy in Kenya in 2016 was 69.0 for females and 64.7 for males. This has been an increment from the year 1990 when the life expectancy was 62.6 and 59.0 respectively. The leading cause of mortality in Kenya in the year 2016 included diarrhoea diseases 18.5%, HIV/AIDs 15.56%, lower respiratory infections 8.62%, tuberculosis 3.69%, ischemic heart disease 3.99%, road injuries 1.47%, interpersonal violence 1.36%. The leading causes of DALYs in Kenya in 2016 included HIV/AIDs 14.65%, diarrhoea diseases 12.45%, lower back and neck pain 2.05%, skin and subcutaneous diseases 2.47%, depression 1.33%, interpersonal violence 1.32%, road injuries 1.3%. The burden of disease in Kenya has mainly been from communicable diseases but it is now shifting to also include the noncommunicable diseases and injuries. As of 2016, the 3 leading causes of death globally were ischemic heart disease 17.33%, stroke 10.11% and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 5.36%.

  Malaria remains a major public health problem in Kenya and accounts for an estimated 16 percent of outpatient consultations. Malaria transmission and infection risk in Kenya are determined largely by altitude, rainfall patterns, and temperature, which leads to considerable variation in malaria prevalence by season and across geographic regions. Approximately 70 percent of the population is at risk for malaria, with 14 million people in endemic areas, and another 17 million in areas of epidemic and seasonal malaria. All four species of Plasmodium parasites that infect humans occur in Kenya. The parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which causes the most severe form of the disease, accounts for more than 99 percent of infections. Kenya has made significant progress in the fight against malaria. The Government of Kenya places a

  A variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can result from sexual activity. A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women." Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Worldwide, an estimated 5–10% of HIV infections are the result of men having sex with men. However, in most of the Western world, more HIV infections are transmitted by men having sex with men than by any other transmission route. In the United States, gay and bisexual men accounted for 70% of 38,739 new HIV diagnoses in 2017. Of the 5,164 people diagnosed

  this is more likely to happen with anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction. Unprotected receptive anal sex (with an HIV positive partner) is the sex act most likely to result in HIV transmission. Other infections that can be transmitted by unprotected anal sex are human papillomavirus (HPV) (which can increase risk of anal cancer ); typhoid fever; amoebiasis; chlamydia; cryptosporidiosis; E. coli infections; giardiasis; gonorrhea; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; herpes simplex; Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8); lymphogranuloma venereum; Mycoplasma hominis; Mycoplasma genitalium; pubic lice; salmonellosis; shigella; syphilis; tuberculosis; and Ureaplasma urealyticum.

  Furthermore, sex workers are also afraid to seek out health services for problems because of structural barriers that prevent them from knowing about and utilizing services that could teach them better prevention methods. A particular example of the disease threats sex workers are faced with can be demonstrated via a study conducted in Cambodia where the rate of HIV has increased. This report studied the prevalence of HIV among a group of indirect sex workers in Cambodia called "beer promotion girls", women employed by distributors to promote and sell beers. The study found that they have the highest rate of HIV because they often sell sex as a means of supplementing their salary. This report also found that among indirect sex

  somewhat increase because there is penetration (either of the vagina, anus or mouth) and there is the potential for bodily fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva) to be exchanged. In addition to the aforementioned STIs, the following can be transmitted through non-exclusive non-penetrative sex acts:  Many individuals are concerned about the risk of HIV/AIDS. Generally, a person must either have unprotected sexual intercourse (vaginal or anal), use an infected syringe or have the virus passed from mother to child to be infected. A person cannot be infected from casual contact, such as hugging; however, there is some risk if HIV-infected

  concluding, "while everyone wants to help prevent deaths from prostate cancer, current methods of PSA screening and treatment of screen-detected cancer are not the answer." More recently, Fenton's 2018 review (conducted for the USPSTF) focused on the two highest quality randomized control studies of the costs and benefits of PSA screening, and the findings illustrate the complex issues associated with cancer screening. Fenton reports that the screening of 1,000 men every four years for 13 years reduces mortality from prostate cancer by just one. More specifically, of those 1,000 men: 243 received an indication of cancer during PSA screening (most of whom then had a biopsy); of those, 3 had to be hospitalized

  Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. It may accelerate pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before starting therapy, and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy. Ethnic groups have different rates of prostate cancer. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer.

 PCSK9 inhibitors, in clinical trials, by several companies, are more effective for LDL reduction than the statins, including statins alone at high dose (though not necessarily the combination of statins plus ezetimibe). ; Statins reduce high levels of LDL particles by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in cells, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. ; Several

  reductase inhibitor, and can reduce cholesterol production. As with statins, this decrease in intra-hepatic (liver) LDL levels may induce hepatic LDL receptor up-regulation, also decreasing plasma LDL levels. As always, a key issue is how benefits and complications of such agents compare with statins—molecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s. ; Phytosterols are widely recognized as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy, although no scientifically proven beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or overall mortality exists. Current supplemental guidelines for reducing LDL recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0 grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15 gram per day.

Evidence suggests that aspirin as a chemoprotective agent may reduce overall cancer incidence and mortality in colorectal, esophageal, and gastric cancers, with smaller effects on prostate, breast, and lung cancer.

  Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC)  but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. Nine years later however, the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 100mg/day)

  The study followed over 35,000 men in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada, who were assigned randomly to receive either both a selenium and vitamin E supplement, selenium and placebo, vitamin E and placebo, or two placebos. It was one of the largest cancer prevention trials ever conducted, and was described by the NCI as "the largest-ever prostate cancer prevention study." Selenium and Vitamin E were chosen because they are well known antioxidants and had other mechanisms by which they were thought to prevent cancer, and preclinical and smaller clinical studies had yielded very promising results. The study was originally planned to last for twelve years after enrollment began. However, it was stopped early in 2008 because no protective effect of supplementation on prostate cancer risk was found, and because the results suggested that vitamin E might increase the risk. About 17,000 participants from the original SELECT completed an additional four years of a Centralized Follow-Up from 2010 until May 31, 2014, when SELECT closed. The follow-up involved sending questionnaires to participants annually, which they could also fill out online.

 1 -0.64467  Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. It may accelerate pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before starting therapy, and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy. Ethnic groups have different rates of prostate cancer. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer.
 2 -1.20038  Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC)  but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. Nine years later however, the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 100mg/day)

More recently, Fenton's 2018 review (conducted for the USPSTF) focused on the two highest quality randomized control studies of the costs and benefits of PSA screening, and the findings illustrate the complex issues associated with cancer screening. Fenton reports that the screening of 1,000 men every four years for 13 years reduces mortality from prostate cancer by just one. More specifically, of those 1,000 men: 243 received an indication of cancer during PSA screening (most of whom then had a biopsy); of those, 3 had to be hospitalized

Evidence suggests that aspirin as a chemoprotective agent may reduce overall cancer incidence and mortality in colorectal, esophageal, and gastric cancers, with smaller effects on prostate, breast, and lung cancer. A review of randomised control trials showed that doses between 75 and 300 mg daily reduced overall cancer incidence by 12% after three years and also demonstrated a 33% reduction in

  CP-122,288 is a drug which acts as a potent and selective agonist for the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F serotonin receptor subtypes. It is a derivative of the migraine medication sumatriptan, but while CP-122,288 is 40,000 times more potent than sumatriptan as an inhibitor of neurogenic inflammation and plasma protein extravasation, it is only twice as potent as a constrictor of blood vessels. In human trials, CP-122,288 was not found to be effective as a treatment for migraine, but its selectivity for neurogenic anti-inflammatory action over vasoconstriction has made it useful for research into the underlying causes of migraine.

  Since migralepsy is, for all intents and purposes, a combination of migraines and epilepsy, the medication for the conditions supplied individually can be combined jointly in order to lessen the effects of both. It is also helpful that many antiepileptic drugs also work as antimigraines, lessening the number of medications that must be taken. Thus, while neither can be cured, they can be treated so that they occur less frequently and allow a patient to live a relatively normal life.

Among primary headaches, the International Classification of Headache Disorders distinguishes between tension headache (the most common), migraine, and cluster headache. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache. Aspirin, especially as a component of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.

  The pharmacokinetic data was collected from animal studies performed in mice and rats. The CMax was obtained 15 minutes after oral ingestion of Osemozotan, the area under the curve was 2,943 ng x hr/mL and the half-life was 1.3 hours. The pharmacokinetic testing has been able to help explain the longer acting pharmacologic effects of Osemozotan, and the increased potency. Osemozotan was shown to have increased duration of pharmacologic effects compared to azapirones and requires a substantially lower dose to produce its pharmacologic effects. This may be attractive to populations that will have to take this medication in that they may not have to take the medication as often throughout the day. In these studies there was a difference in dosage amount necessary for the indication it is used. Osemozotan has not been found to be metabolized to 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine, a common metabolite found with the azapirone class of medications. 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine has affinity for receptors other than 5-HT1A, decreasing its specificity and increasing the risk of unwanted effects. Since Osemozotan does not express this metabolite, it has greater specificity to 5-HT1A compared to other anxiolytic medications.

It is a derivative of the migraine medication sumatriptan, but while CP-122,288 is 40,000 times more potent than sumatriptan as an inhibitor of neurogenic inflammation and plasma protein extravasation, it is only twice as potent as a constrictor of blood vessels. In human trials, CP-122,288 was not found to be effective as a treatment for migraine, but its selectivity for neurogenic anti-inflammatory action over vasoconstriction has made it useful for research into the underlying causes of migraine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine determined that carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/day, but it failed to demonstrate that the drug was sufficiently more effective than placebo in migraine prophylaxis.

['The world must prepare for the next flu pandemic, which could be caused by a virus that has never before infected humans, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday.\n\nThe warning comes as the UN health agency\'s emergency committee on Monday decided that the H7N9 outbreak in China, which has so far infected 131 people and killed 43, does not currently constitute a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nBut the committee, which is made up of experts from around the world, said it would reconvene in a week\'s time to assess whether the situation had changed.\n\nThe H7N9 virus, which is a subtype of bird flu, has been circulating in China since February, and has so far infected mostly people who have had close contact with infected birds or poultry.\n\nBut the WHO said that the virus has the potential to cause a pandemic, and that the world must prepare for the inevitable next flu pandemic, which could be caused by a virus that has never before infected humans.\n\n"The world is not prepared for a pandemic," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the WHO\'s assistant director-general for health security and environment. "We have to be prepared for the worst."\n\nThe WHO\'s pandemic alert system, which is based on a six-point scale, currently has the H7N9 outbreak at level 3', 'World must prepare for inevitable next flu pandemic, WHO says.']

  On May 22, 2009, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan said the virus must be closely monitored in the southern hemisphere, as it could mix with ordinary seasonal influenza and change in unpredictable ways. Experts writing in the July issue of The New England Journal of Medicine noted that historically, pandemic viruses have evolved between seasons, and the current strain may become more severe or transmissible in the coming months. They therefore stressed the importance of international cooperation to engage in proper surveillance to help monitor changes in the virus's behavior, which will aid in both "vaccine targeting" and interpreting illness patterns

  also known to have been infected by humans. Humans have been affected since early 2009. The November 27, 2009 worldwide update by the U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) states that "more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 7,820 deaths". The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, "opening a new chapter in the global epidemic". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They

  system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment. However, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people

  mammalian hosts, which is why the disease it causes is called a bird flu. No pandemic strain of H5N1 has yet been found. The precise nature and extent of the genetic alterations that might change one of the currently circulating avian influenza strains into a human flu strain cannot be known in advance. While many of the current H5N1 strains circulating in birds can generate a dangerous cytokine storm in healthy adult humans, the ultimate pandemic strain might arise from a less-lethal strain, or its current level of lethality might be lost in the adaptation to a human host. If H5N1 mutates so that it can jump from human to human, while maintaining

Indeed, if there is sufficient immunity to stop it at the source, it will not become pandemic. As long as the likelihood of protecting the population continues to rise with the passage of time, that likelihood becomes an increasingly important factor in predicting the loss of lives and the amount of economic dislocation that will ultimately occur.

On June 23, 2009, The New York Times reported that U.S. federal agriculture officials believed that, "contrary to the popular assumption that the new swine flu pandemic arose on factory farms in Mexico", now believe it "most likely emerged in pigs in Asia, but then traveled to North America in a human".

  that reassortment was unlikely at that time due to its ease in replication and transmission. However, Federal health officials in the U.S. noted that the horrific 1918 flu epidemic, which killed hundreds of thousands in the United States alone, was preceded by a mild "herald" wave of cases in the spring, followed by devastating waves of illness in the autumn. As of late July 2009, U.S. health officials said the swine flu wasn't yet mutating to become more dangerous, but they were closely tracking that as the virus continued to circle the globe. As of October 2009, research done by Taubenberger showed that

  The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and a pandemic on March 11. Hundreds of millions of people contracted the disease, a percentage of whom died from it. As a result, travel restrictions, social distancing measures, and many other precautions have been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while many vaccines are undergoing phased distribution in most countries. As with many medical topics, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic emerged and were spread both by private citizens and politicians. The misinformation focuses on

  located in the nose and throat but H1N1/09 can also infect cells with receptor type a2-3. This may explain why some patients experience severe respiratory symptoms. (The H5N1 virus is also able to infect cells deep in the lungs with receptor type a2-3 but cannot infect cells with receptor type a2-6 making it less contagious than H1N1/09.) , most people infected by this flu suffered a mild illness, but the small minority hospitalized were often severely ill. Arand Kumar, an intensive care expert at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, said "this pandemic is like two diseases; either you're off work for a few days or you go to hospital, often to the intensive-care unit (ICU). There's no middle ground." In the southern hemisphere 15 to 33% of

"Indeed, it is just as likely that the illnesses sustained by the rural Vietnamese were caused by some other virus, not a bird-type flu at all — or that if their ailments were due to bird contact, that the cause was any number of bird flu variants, rather than the lethal H5N1 strain being studied intensively now. ...

['A new study has found that heart scans are being used to justify "evidence-free" treatments for heart disease, according to a report published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\nThe study, which was led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that heart scans were being used to justify treatments that were not supported by scientific evidence.\nThe researchers analyzed data from 1,000 patients who had undergone heart scans at a major medical center. They found that 40 percent of the patients received treatments that were not supported by scientific evidence.\nThe most common treatment that was not supported by scientific evidence was the use of statins to lower cholesterol levels. The researchers found that 20 percent of the patients who received statins did not have high cholesterol levels, and that the statins did not provide any significant benefit for these patients.\nThe researchers also found that 10 percent of the patients who received heart scans received treatments that were not recommended by the American Heart Association or the American College of Cardiology.\nThe study highlights the need for greater oversight of heart scans and the treatments that are being recommended based on these scans. The researchers suggest that heart scans should only be used to guide treatment decisions when there is scientific evidence to support the use of these scans.\nThe study also highlights the need for greater education for patients and healthcare', 'Heart scans tied to “evidence-free” treatment: study']

 Coronary CT angiography (CCTA): the use of CT to assess the coronary arteries of the heart. The subject receives an intravenous injection of radiocontrast, and then the heart is scanned using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing radiologists to assess the extent of occlusion in the coronary arteries, usually to diagnose coronary artery disease. ; Coronary CT calcium scan: also used for the assessment of severity of coronary artery disease. Specifically, it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack. A typical coronary CT calcium scan is done without the use of radiocontrast, but it can possibly be done from contrast-enhanced images as well. A

  When ultrasound is used to image the heart it is referred to as an echocardiogram. Echocardiography allows detailed structures of the heart, including chamber size, heart function, the valves of the heart, as well as the pericardium (the sac around the heart) to be seen. Echocardiography uses 2D, 3D, and Doppler imaging to create pictures of the heart and visualize the blood flowing through each of the four heart valves. Echocardiography is widely used in an array of patients ranging from those experiencing symptoms, such as shortness of breath or chest pain, to those undergoing cancer treatments. Transthoracic ultrasound has been proven to be safe for patients of all ages, from infants to the elderly, without risk of harmful side effects or radiation, differentiating it from other imaging modalities. Echocardiography is one of the most commonly used imaging modalities in the world due to its portability and use in a variety of applications. In emergency situations, echocardiography is quick, easily accessible, and able to be performed at the bedside, making it the modality of choice for many physicians.

Some experts note that CT scans are known to be "overused," and "there is distressingly little evidence of better health outcomes associated with the current high rate of scans." On the other hand, a recent paper analyzing the data of patients who received high cumulative doses showed a high degree of appropriate use. This creates an important issue of cancer risk to these patients. Moreover, a highly significant finding that was previously unreported is that some patients received

  scan of the heart is performed to gain knowledge about cardiac or coronary anatomy. Traditionally, cardiac CT scans are used to detect, diagnose, or follow up coronary artery disease. More recently CT has played a key role in the fast-evolving field of transcatheter structural heart interventions, more specifically in the transcatheter repair and replacement of heart valves. The main forms of cardiac CT scanning are: To better visualize the anatomy, post-processing of the images is common. Most common are multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) and volume rendering. For more complex anatomies and procedures, such as heart valve interventions, a true 3D reconstruction or a 3D print is created based on these CT images to gain a deeper understanding.

Multi-linear regression analysis revealed that an increased Framingham cardiovascular score was associated with CIMT, and carotid plaque independent of geographic differences. Cahn et al. prospectively followed-up 152 patients with coronary artery disease for 6–11 months by carotid artery ultrasonography and noted 22 vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and coronary angioplasty) within this time period. They concluded that carotid atherosclerosis measured by this non-interventional method has prognostic significance in coronary artery patients.

  artery flow-disrupting events occur at locations with less than 50% lumenal narrowing. Cardiac stress testing, traditionally the most commonly performed noninvasive testing method for blood flow limitations, generally only detects lumen narrowing of ~75% or greater, although some physicians advocate nuclear stress methods that can sometimes detect as little as 50%. The sudden nature of the complications of pre-existing atheroma, vulnerable plaque (non-occlusive or soft plaque), have led, since the 1950s, to the development of intensive care units and complex medical and surgical interventions. Angiography and later cardiac stress testing was begun to either visualize or indirectly detect stenosis. Next came bypass surgery, to plumb

 In such cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans because research shows that the risk of getting such procedures outweighs the possible benefits. Some of the problems associated with overtesting include patients receiving invasive procedures, overutilizing medical services, getting unnecessary radiation exposure, and experiencing misdiagnosis.

Some of the problems associated with overtesting include patients receiving invasive procedures, overutilizing medical services, getting unnecessary radiation exposure, and experiencing misdiagnosis. Correct staging is critical because treatment (particularly the need for pre-operative therapy and/or for adjuvant treatment, the extent of surgery) is generally based on this parameter. Thus, incorrect staging would lead to improper treatment. For some common cancers the staging process is well-defined. For example, in the cases of breast cancer and prostate cancer, doctors routinely can identify that the cancer is early and that it has low risk of metastasis.<ref name="ASCOfive">, citing

['The marijuana that people smoke today is much more potent than the pot of yesteryear. According to a new study, the THC content in marijuana has increased dramatically over the past few decades.\n\nThe study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the average THC content in marijuana has increased from 3.9 percent in 1995 to 12.2 percent in 2014. This represents a 300 percent increase in potency over the past 20 years.\n\nThe researchers also found that the THC content in marijuana has increased even more dramatically in some states. In Colorado, for example, the average THC content in marijuana has increased from 10.2 percent in 2006 to 18.9 percent in 2014. This represents an 800 percent increase in potency over the past 8 years.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Marcus A. Bachhuber, said that the increase in THC content is a major concern. "The increase in THC content is a major concern because it\'s not clear what the long-term effects of such high levels of THC are," he said.\n\nThe study\'s findings are consistent with previous research. A study published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence found that the average THC content in marijuana has increased', 'Today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear.']

 Isbell et al. (1967) reported that pure THC (which had only recently been chemically isolated with its chemical structure identified) had marijuana-like effects (e.g., increased pulse rate (tachycardia) and altered time sense), whether smoked or taken orally. A number of other isolated compounds present in marijuana (cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene) did not show these effects. ; Isbell and Jasinski (1969) compared LSD (1.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, injected intramuscularly) and smoked THC (225 or 250 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, added to a tobacco cigarette). Physical symptoms were quite different (e.g., tachycardia with THC, dilated pupils with LSD), and tolerance to LSD did not cause

  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as of 2015–2016, 19.5% of Washington adults aged 18 or older have used cannabis within the past year, relative to the national average, which was estimated at 13.9% by the same survey. A 2016 survey by the Washington State Department of Health found that adolescent usage in the state has remained stable over the past decade despite the introduction of retail stores in 2014. According to Monitoring the Future, between 2010–2012 and 2014–2016, marijuana usage by eighth and 10th graders increased by 2.0% and 4.1% respectively.

Under the 2018 United States farm bill, commodity hemp production was federally legalized. It removed hemp, defined as cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low concentrations of the psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (no more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis), from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).

   In the U.S. state of Maine, marijuana (cannabis) is legal for recreational use. It was originally prohibited in 1913. Possession of small amounts of the drug was decriminalized in 1976 under state legislation passed the previous year. The state's first medical cannabis law was passed in 1999, allowing patients to grow their own plants. The cities of Portland and South Portland decriminalized the possession and recreational use of marijuana in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, a ballot initiative, Question 1, proposed the statewide legalization of marijuana use and sale. With all precincts reporting, the results showed a "Yes" vote passing by less than 1 percentage point. However, opponents of the measure sought a recount. Opponents of the measure conceded their effort on December 17, after the recount showed no change in the outcome and that the legalization of cannabis in Maine would go forward.

They have been designed to be similar to THC, the natural cannabinoid with the strongest binding affinity to the CB<sub href="Tetrahydrocannabinol">1 receptor, which is linked to the psychoactive effects or "high" of marijuana. These synthetic analogs often have greater binding affinity and greater potency to the CB<sub href="Cannabis (drug)">1 receptors. There are several synthetic cannabinoid families (e.g. AM-xxx,, HU-xx, JWH-xxx) which are classified by the creator of the substance (eg. JWH stands for John W. Huffman), which can include several substances with different base structures such as classical cannabinoids and unrelated Naphthoylindoles. Synthetic marijuana compounds began to be manufactured and sold in the early 2000s. From 2008 to

  Jean-Baptiste Bagaza was appointed president of Burundi following a military coup in 1976, that deposed Michel Micombero. As president of the Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party, he was the sole candidate in the 1984 presidential election and was re-elected with 99.6% of the votes. During Bagaza's presidency, there were long-standing tensions over the repression of the Roman Catholic Church, in a country where 65% of citizens are practising Catholics. This was later described by diplomats as a key factor in the coup.

  On 29 April 1972 Hutu rebels launched attacks in Bujumbura and southern Burundi. As it suppressed the rebellion, the Burundian government embarked on a programme of ethnic repression, targeting the country's remaining Hutu elites, including those who had served in government and the military. Ndayahoze disappeared after being summoned to a crisis meeting early in the morning on 30 April. It was later revealed that he had been arrested and executed, making him one of the first Hutu officials to be murdered by the regime during its repression. Burundian officials alleged that under interrogation he admitted to plotting the rebellion against the government with other Hutus. In 1987 the widow of Ndayahoze sought compensation for the murder of her husband and on behalf of other families with members who were victims of the 1972 repression. At the request of the Burundian ambassador, she was barred from the UN headquarters building in New York. She later compiled his writings and published them in a book, Le commandant Martin Ndayahoze, un visionnaire.

  In September 1987, Bagaza travelled to Quebec, Canada, to attend a francophone summit. The army took over, led by Bagaza's cousin, Major Pierre Buyoya. Hearing of the coup, Bagaza immediately returned to Africa but Bujumbura Airport was closed, and in Nairobi, he was refused entrance to Kenya. Following the coup, Bagaza fled to Uganda, and then in 1989, Libya, where he was granted political asylum. Buyoya formed the Military Committee for National Salvation to take control, suspended the country's constitution and was inaugurated as president on 2 October 1987. Buyoya, a Roman Catholic, said that he would lift measures imposed on the Catholic Church by Bagaza's government. He was succeeded by Melchior Ndadaye following the 1993 presidential election, and came to power in Burundi for a second time following a military coup in 1996, that ousted Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.

Instead of assisting them, Ndayahoze warned Micombero and as a result 70 people were arrested. Thereafter, Micombero heavily relied on him to calm Hutus in Burundi and prevent ethnic revolt. His tenure as Minister of Information ended in December. In May 1970 Ndayahoze was appointed Minister of Economy. On 3 March 1971 he was dismissed from his ministerial office and attached to the Army General Staff as Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of logistics. Throughout 1971 and 1972 he wrote frequently in his reports to the presidency of the dangers of worsening ethnic relations in Burundi.

  During the 1993 Burundian coup d'état attempt launched by Tutsi army officers early in the morning on 21 October, Bimazubute was collected by soldiers from his residence. Though a Tutsi, he was a proponent of majority rule and was thus regarded as a traitor by the putschists. Bimazubute insisted on dressing in a full suit and tie before the soldiers took him away. The putschists soon thereafter killed him and buried him and the other victims of their coup attempt in a mass grave in the centre of Camp Muha. After several hours the soldiers realised that international opinion would strongly disapprove of such treatment of the bodies, so they exhumed them and allowed family members to collect them. He was the only Tutsi killed during the coup attempt. He and the other coup victims were reburied on 6 December in Bujumbura. The deaths of President Melchior Ndadaye, President of the National Assembly Pontien Karibwami, and Bimazubute eliminated the constitutionally-delineated presidential line of succession. Christian Sendegaya succeeded Bimazubute as Vice-President of the National Assembly on 23 December.

Within three days the police had arrested the Greek, Ioannis Kageorgis, and three Burundian accomplices: Antoine Nahimana, Henri Ntakiyica, and Jean-Baptiste Ntakiyica. The latter three were all members of the PDC. The group quickly admitted responsibility for the murder and incriminated three other persons in their plot: Michel Iatrou, Ntidendereza, and Biroli. The investigators concluded that Ntidendereza and Biroli planned the assassination. Iatrou denied this, while Ntidendereza initially implicated himself in the conspiracy before later recanting his testimony. For his role in the plot, Biroli was initially sentenced to life in prison.

Burundian officials alleged that under interrogation he admitted to plotting the rebellion against the government with other Hutus. In 1987 the widow of Ndayahoze sought compensation for the murder of her husband and on behalf of other families with members who were victims of the 1972 repression. At the request of the Burundian ambassador, she was barred from the UN headquarters building in New York. She later compiled his writings and published them in a book, Le commandant Martin Ndayahoze, un visionnaire.
 4 -3.98762  the third anniversary of Burundian independence, he delivered a speech at Rwagasore Stadium in which he accused the crown of creating "governmental instability, administrative anarchy, and political chaos". He called for "a new party, a new economy, and a new state." While discussions on the creation of a new government took place in wake of the elections, Nyangoma offered himself as a candidate to be named prime minister. In August the Mwami rejected consideration of him for the premiership, surprising Hutu deputies in the Assembly. On 13 September Mwambutsa instead selected Léopold Biha, a trusted Ganwa associated with his court, to lead the government. The installation of Biha infuriated many Hutus and some extremist Tutsis.

Instead of assisting them, Ndayahoze warned Micombero and as a result 70 people were arrested. Thereafter, Micombero heavily relied on him to calm Hutus in Burundi and prevent ethnic revolt. His tenure as Minister of Information ended in December. In May 1970 Ndayahoze was appointed Minister of Economy. On 3 March 1971 he was dismissed from his ministerial office and attached to the Army General Staff as Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of logistics. Throughout 1971 and 1972 he wrote frequently in his reports to the presidency of the dangers of worsening ethnic relations in Burundi.

['Archaeologists have discovered that King Tutankhamun, the boy king of ancient Egypt, died from malaria, according to a new study.\nThe findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, are based on a CT scan of Tut\'s skull, which revealed a lesion on the left parietal bone.\nThe lesion, which was previously unknown, was found to be consistent with malaria, the researchers said.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Zahi Hawass, said the discovery was "a major breakthrough in our understanding of the death of Tutankhamun."\n"This is the first time that malaria has been identified as the cause of death in an Egyptian pharaoh," Hawass said in a statement.\nThe researchers also found evidence of a healed fracture on the left side of Tut\'s skull, which they believe was caused by a blow to the head.\nThe blow, which occurred before Tut\'s death, may have contributed to his demise, the researchers said.\n"The malaria infection weakened Tutankhamun\'s immune system, making him more susceptible to other infections and injuries," Hawass said.\nThe study\'s senior author, Dr. Salima Ikram, said the findings shed new light on the health of the boy king.\n"Tutankhamun\'s health was not as good as previously thought," I', 'Tests show King Tut died from malaria, study says.']

  In 2012, Dr Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at Imperial College London, hypothesized that early deaths of Thutmose IV and other 18th Dynasty pharaohs, including Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, were likely a result of familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for the untimely demise of Thutmose IV and could also explain his religious vision described on the Dream Stele as this type of epilepsy is associated with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.

  It had been thought that Ramesses III lived long enough to oversee the trial of his attempted assassins as the document opens with him addressing the judges directly. However, he is referred to in the Papyrus Lee as "the Great God", a term used only for deceased kings at this time. His well-preserved and still wrapped mummy does not display any outward signs of a violent death so the cause of death was long assumed to be a natural one. Recent CT scanning revealed that beneath the bandages on his neck was a large gash that cut all the way to the bone. This injury proved fatal. The mummy of 'Unknown Man E' has been confirmed as a son of Ramesses III. This mummy was not mummified in a typical fashion, and was interred in a ritually impure goatskin inside an uninscribed coffin. This treatment certainly makes the body a likely candidate for that of Pentawer.

  From an examination of Seti's extremely well-preserved mummy, Seti I appears to have been less than forty years old when he died unexpectedly. This is in stark contrast to the situation with Horemheb, Ramesses I and Ramesses II who all lived to an advanced age. The reasons for his relatively early death are uncertain, but there is no evidence of violence on his mummy. His mummy was found decapitated, but this was likely caused after his death by tomb robbers. The Amun priest carefully reattached his head to his body with the use of linen cloths.

  Like his probable predecessor Nimlot, he proclaimed himself king, adopting the full royal titulary although he was no more than a governor of Hermopolis and a vassal of the Kushite 25th Dynasty. His cartouches appear carved on the shoulders of a damaged block statue depicting the priest Tjanhesret, found in Luxor in 1909 and now in the Cairo Museum (CG 42212), and on a bronze naos-shaped amulet of Amun-Ra of unknown provenance – possibly from Thebes – and now in the British Museum (EA11015). The only known depiction of the king is found on a votive scribal pallet now in the collection of the Egypt Centre of Swansea University. British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen has suggested that the successor of Djehutyemhat could have been the poorly known "king" Pedinemty.

Ryholt observes that the length of the damaged cartouche would fit well with the long prenomen of Sekhemre-Heruhirmaat. Ryholt suggested that Sekhemre-Heruhirmaat Intef died prematurely and was buried in a royal coffin that initially belonged to Nubkheperre Intef; hence, Sekhemre-Heruhirmaat Intef did not enjoy an independent reign of his own. The British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, however, criticises Ryholt's proposal that Sekhemre-Heruhirmaat Intef died during the reign of his predecessor and was buried in Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's original royal coffin. Dodson observes that the form of the name Intef written here (which was originally

Dodson also stresses that On the matter of the coffins of the Inyotef kings, Ryholt fails to address the key point that the container used for Sekhemre-heruhirmaet (his "Inyotef H") is certainly a "stock" [i.e., non-royal] coffin, made lacking the deceased's name, to be inserted later—just as was that later used for the burial of Kamose. On this basis, there seems no possibility of the former having been the original coffin of Inyotef

  care at a low cost to those who need it most. In the case of deinstitutionalization, as the number of patients treated increased, the quality and availability of care went down. With the case of small, private treatment homes, as the quality of the care went up their ability to handle large numbers of patients decreased. This unending battle for the middle ground is a difficult one but there seems to be hope. For example, the 2009 Federal Stimulus Package and Health Reform Act have increased the funding for community health centers substantially. Undoubtedly as community mental health moves forward, there will continue to be a juggling act between clinical needs and standards, political agendas, and funding.

One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program "wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape". In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used "misleading and inaccurate information".

The Utah standard is that the proposed patient has a mental illness that poses a substantial danger. "Substantial danger" means the person, by his or her behavior, due to mental illness: (a) is at serious risk to: (i) commit suicide, (ii) inflict serious

The DSMB recommended that the trial be stopped due to futility.\nThe DSMB reviewed data from 120 subjects enrolled in the trial, of which 60 subjects received GRNOPC1 and 60 subjects received standard of care. The DSMB concluded that the data did not support the primary endpoint of the trial, which is the proportion of subjects with a motor score improvement of three or more points on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale D (AIS-D) at 12 months post-injury.\nThe DSMB also concluded that the data did not support the secondary endpoint of the trial, which is the proportion of subjects with a motor score improvement of one or more points on the AIS-D at 24 months post-injury.\nThe DSMB recommended that the trial', 'Geron shares fall after cancer drug study update.']

 Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a drug that targets telomerase. In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University, GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks. Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the in vitro clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with multiple myeloma. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable. In 2014, Geron licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech.  In 2017, imetelstat was granted fast track status by the FDA for certain patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. In 2018, Janssen Biotech returned the rights to

  On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans. GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of spinal cord injury through remyelination of damaged axons. This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells. Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished. Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013.

  As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early myelinated glial cells, a type of cell that insulates nerve cells. For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months. In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released. The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011. In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO at the time was Geron founder Michael D.

Immediately following this announcement, CancerVax's stock plunged $1.30, or 44.5%, to $1.62 and well below its 52-week low of $2.70. In less than 30 minutes after the opening bell, nearly 850,000 CancerVax shares had been traded, or more than 17 times the average daily trade for the previous three months. Shares of Serono were off 15 cents, or 0.9%, to $16.35.

In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University, GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks. Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the in vitro clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with multiple myeloma. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable. In 2014, Geron licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech.  In 2017, imetelstat was granted fast track status by the FDA for certain patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. In 2018, Janssen Biotech returned the rights to

['The common cold is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, throat, and sinuses. It is caused by various viruses, including rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. The symptoms of a cold typically include a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, and a sore throat. In some cases, a fever may also be present. The symptoms of a cold usually last for 7-10 days, but can sometimes persist for up to 3 weeks.\n\nOn the other hand, Covid-19 is a viral infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The symptoms of Covid-19 can range from mild to severe, and may include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell. In some cases, Covid-19 can lead to hospitalization and even death.\n\nThe key difference between a cold and Covid-19 is the severity of the symptoms. While a cold typically causes mild symptoms that resolve on their own, Covid-19 can cause severe and potentially life-threatening complications. Additionally, while a cold is typically spread through close contact with an infected person, Covid-19 can be spread through the air and can infect people who are not in close contact.\n\nIn terms of treatment, there is no specific treatment for a cold,', 'If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold, not Covid-19.']

  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most

  breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse

  and experts is that the action of inhaling droplets from an infected person is most likely the way SARS-CoV-2 is spreading. As more people travel and more goods and capital are traded globally, COVID-19 cases started to slowly appear all over the world. Some of the symptoms that COVID-19 patients could experience is shortness of breath (which might be a sign of pneumonia), cough, fever, and diarrhea. The three most recorded and common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and coughing, as reported by the World Health Organization.

   The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID-19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell.

  be able to transmit from ill people to others. There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.

  develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk

  The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. However, people transferred to

  One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. The involvement of both the central and prepheral nervous system in COVID-19 has been reported in many medical publications. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID-19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell.

  One of the most common diseases caused by door handle bacteria is the common cold. Since the virus is spread mostly by direct contact with an object or surface that has been contaminated by the infection and then touching our face, the everyday dangers are obvious. The symptoms become apparent a few days after the patient is infected and the following ones are the most recognizable: sore throat, runny nose, cough and sneezing. A statistic shows that on average 13,738,175 people in the United Kingdom suffer from common cold. By this number Britain has the largest number of infections of all countries in Western Europe.

The attrition of brokers and assets was particularly harsh in 2005. In February, Todd and Donn Carmel, the sons of the former CEO Bill Carmel, also left the firm for Smith Barney (now known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney).

["Statin drugs, commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol, may also help prevent kidney damage after surgery, according to a new study.\nResearchers found that patients who took statins before and after surgery were less likely to develop acute kidney injury (AKI) than those who didn't take the drugs.\nAKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function, and is a common complication of major surgery. It can lead to long-term kidney damage and even death.\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, included more than 1,000 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery.\nThe researchers found that 18 percent of patients who didn't take statins developed AKI, compared to 11 percent of those who did.\nThe study also found that patients who took statins before surgery were less likely to develop AKI than those who started taking the drugs after surgery.\nThe findings suggest that statins may have a protective effect on the kidneys, the researchers said.\nStatins work by blocking an enzyme that helps produce cholesterol. They have been shown to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, and are often prescribed to people with high cholesterol.\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, said the findings could have important implications", 'Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery']

  As phosphate nephropathy is considered an irreversible complication when starting to progress into acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, prevention strategies can help to avoid the undesired outcomes. According to the FDA, it is recommended for both healthcare professionals and patients, particularly high-risk individuals, to obtain adequate information about the adverse effect of OSP before administering and consuming this agent. Monitoring of renal function weeks or months after the administration of OSP also helps to early detect and treat the condition appropriately. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy. As ingestion of OPS can potentially induce osmotic diarrhea and result in depletion of body fluid, adequate hydration is recommended before and after the procedure to prevent episodes of

  Shannon et al. observed in 1932 that dogs had an increased renal function after high protein meals – which they termed "renal function reserve". Activation of this "reserve" or extra-renal function has been suggested as a potential mechanism for ARC in severe illness. The administration of medications which increase blood flow to the kidneys has also been considered a potential cause of ARC, including administration of fluids. Some medications which have been thought to cause increased renal clearance include norepinephrine and other vasopressors. While medications may increase renal clearance, many patients with severe illness have higher clearance prior to the initiation of these medications. Augmented renal clearance also may occur in people who have some types of cancers, such as hematologic cancers. In these people, the efficacy of antibiotic treatment may be decreased if the increased clearance is not accounted for.

  Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly. Symptoms may include muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat. Some of the muscle breakdown products, such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure. The muscle damage is most often the result of a crush injury, strenuous exercise, medications, or a substance use disorder. Other causes include infections, electrical injury, heat stroke, prolonged immobilization, lack of blood flow to a limb, or snake bites. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. Some people have inherited muscle conditions that increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis is supported by a urine test strip which is positive for "blood" but the urine contains no red blood cells when examined with a microscope. Blood tests show a creatine

In the late 1990s it introduced a statin drug, Baycol (cerivastatin), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing kidney failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class. Trasylol (aprotinin), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2007 when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.

 Age: Older people may have degeneration of neural pathways involved with bladder function and it can lead to an increased risk of postoperative urinary retention. The risk of postoperative urinary retention increases up to 2.11 fold for people older than 60 years. ; Medications: Anticholinergics and medications with anticholinergic properties, alpha-adrenergic agonists, opiates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), calcium-channel blockers and beta-adrenergic agonists, may increase the risk. ; Anesthesia: General anesthetics during surgery may cause bladder atony by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant. General anesthetics can directly interfere with autonomic regulation of detrusor tone and predispose people to bladder overdistention and subsequent retention. Spinal anesthesia results in a blockade of the micturition reflex. Spinal anesthesia shows a higher risk of postoperative urinary retention compared to general anesthesia. ; Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia are at an increased risk of acute urinary retention. ; Surgery related: Operative times longer than 2 hours may lead to an increased risk of postoperative urinary retention 3-fold.

  According to the FDA, caution is required to consider prior use of OSP, especially in patients with the following potential risk factors. For instance, people older than 55, female gender, people with a history of kidney diseases if their GFR level is less than 60 mL/min, people who recurrently on antihypertensive treatment with NSAIDs, ARBs, ACEIs, and diuretics, people who have lower fluid intake and less bowel movements, people who have underlying systemic and gastrointestinal diseases, and a short interval between OSP administrations (less than 12 hours interval). The risk of acquiring phosphate nephropathy was reported to increase in parallel with the number of these listed risk factors. Older people are particularly at risk when using OSP for colonoscopy, as they have lower fluid intake, have intrinsically less bowel movements, and often have antihypertensive or nephrotoxic drugs. It is also reported that people with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other metabolic syndromes will have a higher risk of phosphate nephropathy.

  Phosphate nephropathy or nephrocalcinosis is an adverse renal condition that arises with a formation of phosphate crystals within the kidney's tubules. This renal insufficiency is associated with the use of oral sodium phosphate (OSP) such as C.B. Fleet's Phospho soda and Salix's Visocol, for bowel cleansing prior to a colonoscopy. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the potential risk factors of this complication are pre-existing kidney disease, increased age, female gender, dehydration, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,...concurrent treatment with hypertensive medications (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) and medications that affect renal perfusion (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAIDs and diuretics). This complication can be diagnosed with renal tests and biomarkers in laboratories including histochemical staining of renal biopsy specimens, the measure of creatinine level, GFR level, and urine output, urine microscopy, CT scanning, and urinalysis.

  Kidney dysfunction typically develops 1–2 days after the initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained. Three main modalities of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require access to the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done several times a week in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.

 PCSK9 inhibitors, in clinical trials, by several companies, are more effective for LDL reduction than the statins, including statins alone at high dose (though not necessarily the combination of statins plus ezetimibe). ; Statins reduce high levels of LDL particles by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in cells, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. ; Several

The muscle damage is most often the result of a crush injury, strenuous exercise, medications, or a substance use disorder. Other causes include infections, electrical injury, heat stroke, prolonged immobilization, lack of blood flow to a limb, or snake bites. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. Some people have inherited muscle conditions that increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis is supported by a urine test strip which is positive for "blood" but the urine contains no red blood cells when examined with a microscope. Blood tests show a creatine

According to the FDA, it is recommended for both healthcare professionals and patients, particularly high-risk individuals, to obtain adequate information about the adverse effect of OSP before administering and consuming this agent. Monitoring of renal function weeks or months after the administration of OSP also helps to early detect and treat the condition appropriately. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy.

Although these drugs may have significant uricosuric action, their other significant pharmacological actions in off-label use as a uricosuric requires careful assessment of the patient to achieve the most benefit and least risk. Abdominal surgery also has a uricosuric effect, as well as the potential to precipitate an acute attack of gout.
 5 -2.40838  According to the FDA, caution is required to consider prior use of OSP, especially in patients with the following potential risk factors. For instance, people older than 55, female gender, people with a history of kidney diseases if their GFR level is less than 60 mL/min, people who recurrently on antihypertensive treatment with NSAIDs, ARBs, ACEIs, and diuretics, people who have lower fluid intake and less bowel movements, people who have underlying systemic and gastrointestinal diseases, and a short interval between OSP administrations (less than 12 hours interval). The risk of acquiring phosphate nephropathy was reported to increase in parallel with the number of these listed risk factors. Older people are particularly at risk when using OSP for colonoscopy, as they have lower fluid intake, have intrinsically less bowel movements, and often have antihypertensive or nephrotoxic drugs. It is also reported that people with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other metabolic syndromes will have a higher risk of phosphate nephropathy.

['\nBlue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a type of algae that can be found in freshwater sources such as lakes, ponds, and rivers. These algae are capable of producing toxins that can be lethal to dogs and other pets. The toxins produced by blue-green algae are called cyanotoxins, and they can cause a range of symptoms in dogs, including vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and even death.\n\nCyanotoxins are produced by certain strains of blue-green algae, and they can be found in both fresh and saltwater sources. The toxins can be released into the water during hot, sunny weather, and they can persist in the water for several weeks.\n\nDogs are particularly susceptible to the effects of cyanotoxins because they are more likely to drink water from lakes, ponds, and rivers. In addition, dogs are smaller than humans, and they are more likely to consume large amounts of water in a short period of time.\n\nThe symptoms of cyanotoxin poisoning in dogs can vary depending on the type of toxin and the amount consumed.

  Some cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins, cytotoxins, endotoxins, and hepatotoxins (e.g., the microcystin-producing bacteria genus microcystis), which are collectively known as cyanotoxins. Specific toxins include anatoxin-a, guanitoxin, aplysiatoxin, cyanopeptolin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, nodularin R (from Nodularia), neosaxitoxin, and saxitoxin. Cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain conditions. This results in algal blooms which can become harmful to other species and pose a danger to humans and animals if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Several cases of human poisoning have been documented, but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks, and research by Linda Lawton, FRSE at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen

  Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea. Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to

  or scum. These blooms can be toxic, and frequently lead to the closure of recreational waters when spotted. Marine bacteriophages are significant parasites of unicellular marine cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial growth is favoured in ponds and lakes where waters are calm and have little turbulent mixing. Their lifecycles are disrupted when the water naturally or artificially mixes from churning currents caused by the flowing water of streams or the churning water of fountains. For this reason blooms of cyanobacteria seldom occur in rivers unless the water is flowing slowly. Growth is also favoured at higher temperatures which enable Microcystis species to outcompete diatoms and green algae, and potentially allow

  Cyanobacteria, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that obtain energy via photosynthesis. The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, "blue-green algae",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. They appear to have originated in freshwater or a terrestrial environment. Sericytochromatia, the proposed name of the paraphyletic and most basal group, is the ancestor of both the non-photosynthetic group Melainabacteria and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, also called Oxyphotobacteria. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light. Unlike heterotrophic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have internal membranes. These are flattened sacs called thylakoids where photosynthesis is performed. Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in

  On June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, possibly under the influence of domoic acid, flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters. Since March 2007, marine mammal and seabird strandings and deaths off the Southern California coast have increased markedly. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid. According to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute, "It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing. Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human-related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts, or transport of algae species via ship ballast water."

This can lead to serious consequences, particularly the contamination of sources of drinking water. Researchers including Linda Lawton at Robert Gordon University, have developed techniques to study these. Cyanobacteria can interfere with water treatment in various ways, primarily by plugging filters (often large beds of sand and similar media) and by producing cyanotoxins, which have the potential to cause serious illness if consumed. Consequences may also lie within fisheries and waste management practices. Anthropogenic eutrophication, rising temperatures, vertical stratification and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide are contributors to

  Domoic acid producing algal blooms are associated with the phenomenon of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). Domoic acid can bioaccumulate in marine organisms such as shellfish, anchovies, and sardines that feed on the phytoplankton known to produce this toxin. It can accumulate in high concentrations in the tissues of these plankton feeders when the toxic phytoplankton are high in concentration in the surrounding waters. Domoic acid is a neurotoxin that inhibits neurochemical processes, causing short-term memory loss, brain damage, and, in severe cases, death in humans.

They can occur as planktonic cells or form phototrophic biofilms. They are found inside stones and shells (in endolithic ecosystems). A few are endosymbionts in lichens, plants, various protists, or sponges and provide energy for the host. Some live in the fur of sloths, providing a form of camouflage.

["In the wake of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, China's blood donations have reportedly dried up, according to state media.\nThe country's Red Cross Society has issued an urgent call for donations, warning that supplies are running low, the South China Morning Post reported.\nThe shortage is due to a number of factors, including the closure of donation centers and a reluctance among people to donate due to fears of contracting the virus.\nThe Red Cross Society has also reported a shortage of staff to collect donations, as many have been quarantined due to exposure to the virus.\nThe shortage of blood has forced some hospitals to ration supplies, with some reportedly turning away patients in need of transfusions.\nThe Red Cross Society has called on people to donate blood, and has urged those who have already donated to do so again.\nThe outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan, has now spread to at least 14 other countries, including the United States, and has killed more than 1,000 people in China.\nThe Red Cross Society has set up a special fund to help with the outbreak, and is working with the government to provide medical supplies and support to affected areas.\nThe shortage of blood is just one of the many challenges facing China as it grapples with the outbreak.\nThe country's economy has been hit hard, with factories", "China's blood donations dry up as coronavirus outbreak quells giving."]

  Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič expressed gratitude and praised collaboration between the EU and China. Chinese aid has also been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. Chinese-Americans also marshalled networks in China to obtain medical supplies. On 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff. While the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca said these medical supplies were donated by the Chinese Red Cross, there were other sources that said that these were paid products and services. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma also donated 500,000 masks and other medical supplies, which

  China received funds and equipment in donations from a number of other countries to help fight the pandemic. The United Front Work Department (UFWD) also coordinated diplomatic channels, state-owned businesses and Chinese diaspora community associations in urging overseas Chinese to buy masks and send them to China. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico's former ambassador to China, suggested that "China was evidently hiding the extent of a pandemic...while covertly securing PPE at low prices", according to Global News. Guajardo called it a "surreptitious" operation that left "the world naked with no supply of PPE." China has also sent tests, equipment, and experts to other countries to help fight the pandemic.

['A new blood test can detect concussions in children, according to a study published in the Journal of Neurotrauma.\nThe test, developed by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, measures levels of a protein called UBI3A in the blood.\nThe protein is released into the bloodstream after a head injury, and its levels can be used to determine the severity of the concussion.\nThe study involved 100 children who had suffered a concussion, and the results showed that the blood test was able to accurately detect concussions in 99% of cases.\nThe test can be administered within hours of the injury, and can provide a more accurate diagnosis than traditional methods, such as CT scans and MRI scans.\nThe researchers hope that the test will eventually be used to help diagnose concussions in children who are unable to communicate their symptoms, such as those who are unconscious or have suffered a severe head injury.\nThe study is a significant step forward in the diagnosis and treatment of concussions, which are a common injury in children and can have serious long-term consequences.\nThe blood test is non-invasive, and can be administered quickly and easily, making it an ideal tool for diagnosing concussions in children.\nThe researchers are now working to develop a portable version of the test, which can be used in the field or in emergency rooms.', 'Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test']

  CSF albumin is a measurement used to determine the levels of albumin in cerebrospinal fluid. A closely related test, CSF total protein is a measurement used to determine the levels of protein in cerebrospinal fluid. It combines the albumin, IgG, and other proteins. It can be useful in distinguishing among causes of Meningitis. It is more likely to be elevated in bacterial meningitis than in viral meningitis. The upper normal range is 150 mg/dl in neonates, and 50 mg/dl in adults.

  Conditioned play audiometry (CPA) is a type of audiometry done in children from ages 2 to 5 years old, in developmental age. It is the test that directly follows visual reinforcement audiometry when the child becomes able to focus on a task. It is a type of behavioral hearing test, of which there are many. Conditioned play audiometry uses toys to direct the child's attention on the listening task and turns it into a game. Instead of raising one's hand in response to the sound, as an adult would, the child might drop a toy into a bucket every time he or she hears a sound. This keeps the child interested in the listening task for longer. Common games include dropping

  A white blood cell differential is a medical laboratory test that provides information about the types and amounts of white blood cells in a person's blood. The test, which is usually ordered as part of a complete blood count (CBC), measures the amounts of the five normal white blood cell types – neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils – as well as abnormal cell types if they are present. These results are reported as percentages and absolute values, and compared against reference ranges to determine whether the values are normal, low, or high. Changes in the amounts of white blood cells can aid in the diagnosis of

  According to the Merck Manual: "SSPE is suspected in young patients with dementia and neuromuscular irritability. EEG, CT or MRI, CSF examination, and measles serologic testing are done. EEG shows periodic complexes with high-voltage diphasic waves occurring synchronously throughout the recording. CT or MRI may show cortical atrophy or white matter lesions. CSF examination usually reveals normal pressure, cell count, and total protein content; however, CSF globulin is almost always elevated, constituting up to 20 to 60% of CSF protein. Serum and CSF contain elevated levels of measles virus antibodies. Anti-measles IgG appears to increase as the disease progresses. If test results are inconclusive, brain biopsy may be needed."

  The white blood cell differential is a common blood test that is often ordered alongside a complete blood count. The test may be performed as part of a routine medical examination; to investigate certain symptoms, particularly those suggestive of infection or hematological disorders; or to monitor existing conditions, such as blood disorders and inflammatory diseases. Five types of white blood cells are normally found in blood: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Marked shifts in the proportions of these cell types, as measured by the automated or manual differential, can indicate various health conditions. Additionally, cell types which do not normally occur in the blood, such as blast cells, can be identified by the manual differential. These cell types may be found in blood disorders and other pathological states. The manual differential can also identify changes in the appearance of white blood cells, such

  When immature or abnormal white blood cells are present, automated differential results may be incorrect, necessitating a manual blood smear review. Overall, 10 to 25 percent of CBC samples are flagged for manual review by the analyzer. Although most abnormal samples are automatically flagged, some may be missed; conversely, analyzers may generate false positive flags when no abnormal cells are present. Hematology laboratories compensate for these issues by requiring a smear review when differential or CBC results fall outside certain numerical thresholds, regardless of the presence of analyzer flags. The sensitivity and specificity of analyzer flagging can be determined by comparing analyzer flags to manual differential results. The automated basophil count is notoriously unreliable, often underestimating counts in basophilia and producing falsely elevated results in the presence of abnormal cells. The manual differential is therefore considered the reference method for these cells. Analyzers may count nucleated red blood cells, giant and clumped platelets, and red blood cells containing abnormal hemoglobins (such as Hemoglobin S in sickle cell disease) as white blood cells, leading to faulty differential results. Automated differential counts on aged specimens may be incorrect due to cellular degeneration.

['The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has confirmed two more cases of rabies in skunks in the Detroit area, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to five.\nThe latest cases were confirmed in Wayne County, according to a news release from MDHHS.\nThe first confirmed case was in a skunk trapped in the city of Detroit on Sept. 19. The second confirmed case was in a skunk trapped in the city of Detroit on Oct. 1. The third confirmed case was in a skunk trapped in the city of Detroit on Oct. 3. The fourth confirmed case was in a skunk trapped in the city of Detroit on Oct. 10.\nThe fifth confirmed case was in a skunk trapped in Wayne County on Oct. 12.\nThe MDHHS is urging people to avoid contact with wild animals, including skunks, bats, foxes, raccoons, and feral cats.\nRabies is a viral disease that is transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected warm-blooded animal. The disease is almost always fatal if not treated within the first 10 days after exposure.\nIn Michigan, the most common carriers of rabies are bats and skunks.\nThe MDHHS recommends that people who have been bitten, scratched, or otherwise exposed to saliva or other', 'More cases of rabies in skunks confirmed in Detroit area.']

'Under no circumstances should people handle flying foxes on their property as some diseases they carry, such as Australian bat lyssavirus, are transmissible to humans,' Dr Carnie said in a statement. Only trained volunteers or workers should handle bats. Anyone who encounters a sick or injured flying fox should not try to catch it but call the DSE Customer Service Centre on 136 186."

Juveniles get their final color after 21 days, open their eyes at 32 days, can spray musk at 46 days and are weaned after two months. They reach adult size at 15 weeks and reach sexual maturity in time to participate in the mating season after their birth. The young disperse in the fall, but can pass the winter with their mothers in a communal den. This skunk is omnivorous, however, it is the most carnivorous of the family. It feeds mainly on insects, fruits, berries in the summer months, and hunts small mammals, birds, and reptiles during

  1 tablespoon (15 g) of the odorous oil and can quickly spray five times in row. It takes about one week to replenish the oil. The secretion of the spotted skunks differs from that of the striped skunks. The two major thiols of the striped skunks, (E)-2-butene-1-thiol and 3-methyl-1-butanethiol are the major components in the secretion of the spotted skunks along with a third thiol, 2-phenylethanethiol. Thioacetate derivatives of the three thiols are present in the spray of the striped skunks but not the spotted skunks. They are not as odoriferous as the thiols. Water hydrolysis converts them to the more potent thiols. This chemical conversion may be why pets that have been sprayed by skunks will have a faint "skunky" odor on damp evenings. Spotted skunks can spray up to roughly 10 feet.

  micro-filtration processes are available. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision. Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches) is their prime purpose. Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs). Bioaccumulation of chemically-prepared agricultural insecticides is a matter of concern for the many species, especially birds, which consume insects as a primary food source.

  From 2011 to 2012, a member of a research time failed to give a group of thirty rabbits proper pain relief medication. On February 5, 2013, the same person breached protocol by improperly administering another rabbit anesthesia during surgery. In 2013, a rabbit was discovered to have a fractured pelvis that resulted in paralysis and euthanasia. Although the lab claimed to have no explanation of what happened, it was discovered that a technician had handled the animal the previous day, and a necropsy suggested that the injury occurred on that day. In February 2014, the USDA found that a guinea pig had died after not receiving proper pain relief for a surgery three days prior.

  Boars can be damaging to agriculture in situations where their natural habitat is sparse. Populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. However, they generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34–47% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, as was the case in Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of

The authors of the same analysis recommended that other blood sugar lowering agents be considered in people with other risk factors for bladder cancer such as cigarette smoking, family history, or exposure to certain forms of chemotherapy. Thiazolidinediones reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures in women, possibly as a result of biasing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells away from osteoblast differentiation and toward adipocyte formation. Thiazolidinediones increase expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

  After initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density, several studies demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1,523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture. A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K (a vitamin necessary for bone health) and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.

Several forms of lipodystrophy cause insulin resistance, which has responded favorably to thiazolidinediones. There are some indications that thiazolidinediones provide some degree of protection against the initial stages of breast carcinoma development. Evidence was emerging in 2008 that vitamin E with thiazolidinediones is effective in the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis due to their combined antioxidant and insulin sensitizing effects, producing histological improvements in steatosis severity.

Preventive efforts to reduce motor vehicle crashes, the most common cause of high-force trauma, include reducing distractions while driving. Common distractions are driving under the influence and texting or calling while driving, both of which lead to an approximate 6-fold increase in crashes. Wearing a seatbelt can also reduce the likelihood of injury in a collision. 30 km/h or 20 mph speed limits (as opposed to the more common intracity 50 km/h / 30 mph) also drastically reduce the risk of accident, serious injury and even death in crashes between motor vehicles and

 3 -1.17439  Women with type I diabetes were found to be twice as likely to experience adverse cardiovascular events when compared to men with the same disease and were less likely to receive aggressive treatment to control modifiable risk factors. Women with Type II diabetes are at greater risk than men with the same condition despite similar glycemic control. Studies show an increased risk of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction in premenopausal women with diabetes when compared to women without diabetes.
 4 -4.03139  Testosterone therapy may improve the management of type 2 diabetes. Low testosterone has been associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease. Topical androgens like testosterone have been used and studied in the treatment of cellulite in women.
 5 -4.64642  Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing traditional risk factors for CVD such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Moreover, women diagnosed with gestational diabetes remain at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease despite blood sugar metabolism returning to normal post-pregnancy.

['Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist and author, has been a vocal opponent of the Energy Independence and Security Act, which requires that 25 percent of all light bulbs sold in the U.S. be energy-efficient by 2008.\n\nIn a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Schlafly said that the compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) "allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks."\n\nSchlafly\'s comments were met with applause from the audience, but they were also met with criticism from some who say that Schlafly\'s claims are not based on scientific evidence.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, "there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that CFLs cause migraines or epilepsy attacks."\n\nThe Academy also notes that CFLs contain a small amount of mercury, which can be dangerous if not disposed of properly. However, the Academy says that the amount of mercury in a CFL is "less than the amount found in a typical thermometer."\n\nIn addition, the Academy says that CFLs can save consumers money and energy, and that they are a "safe and effective" alternative to traditional incandescent light bulbs.\n\nDespite the Academy\'s findings, Schlafly has continued to speak out against CFLs', 'Phyllis Schlafly Says broken compact fluorescent light bulbs "allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks.']

IT = Iβ + ΣIi (neglecting internal conversion) The beta feeding Iβ (that is, how many times a level is populated by direct feeding from the parent) can not be measured directly. Since the only magnitude that can be measured are the gamma intensities ΣIi and IT (that is, the amount of gammas emitted by the daughter with a certain energy), the beta feeding has to be extracted indirectly by subtracting the contribution from gamma de-excitations of higher energy levels (ΣIi) to the total gamma intensity that leaves the level (IT), that is: Iβ = IT − ΣIi (IT and ΣIi can be measured)

  In his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of migraine with aura, describing very accurately the process of "moving fortifications" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome. Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine per se, or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called Alice in Wonderland syndrome has been named after Dodgson's little heroine because its manifestation can resemble the

The daughter nucleus can only stay in that excited state for a small amount of time (the half life of the level) after which it suffers a series of gamma transitions to its lower energy levels. These transitions allow the daughter nucleus to emit the excitation energy as one or more gamma rays until it reaches its ground state, thus getting rid of all the excitation energy that it kept from the decay. According to this, the energy levels of the daughter nucleus can be populated in two ways: The total gamma rays emitted by an energy level (IT) should be equal to

 by direct beta feeding from the beta decay of the parent into the daughter (Iβ), ; by gamma transitions of higher energy levels (previously beta-populated from the direct beta decay of the parent) into lower energy levels (ΣIi). Typically, when a parent nucleus beta-decays into its daughter, there is some final energy available which is shared between the final products of the decay. This is called the Q value of the beta decay (Qβ). The daughter nucleus doesn't necessarily end up in the ground state after the decay, this only happens when the other products have taken all the available energy with them (usually as kinetic energy). So, in general, the daughter nucleus keeps an amount of the available energy as

["A panel of experts has recommended that all adults who smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years should receive the pneumococcal vaccine.\nThe recommendation, made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is based on evidence that shows smokers are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, which can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections.\nThe vaccine, which is given in a series of two shots, is currently recommended for adults aged 65 and older, as well as for those with certain medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.\nThe new recommendation is expected to have a significant impact on public health, as smoking is still a major public health problem in the United States. According to the CDC, smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States, and is responsible for more than 90% of lung cancer deaths.\nThe recommendation is also expected to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry, as the cost of the vaccine is covered by most insurance plans.\nThe ACIP's recommendation will now go to the CDC's director for final approval. If approved, the recommendation will be added to the CDC's immunization schedule, which", 'Panel recommends pneumonia vaccine for adult smokers']

The CDC recommends that young children and adults over the age of 65 receive the pneumococcal vaccine, as well as older children or younger adults who have an increased risk of getting pneumococcal disease. The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition. People with COPD are recommended by a number of guidelines to have a pneumococcal vaccination. Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles.

In children less than 6 months of age, exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease.

  Screening studies for lung cancer have only been done in high risk populations, such as smokers and workers with occupational exposure to certain substances. In the 2010s recommendations by medical authorities are turning in favour of lung cancer screening, which is likely to become more widely available in the advanced economies. In December 2013 the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its long-standing recommendation that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer to the following: "The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults ages 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery".

  Research has generated evidence that second-hand smoke causes the same problems as direct smoking, including lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lung ailments such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. Specifically, meta-analyses show that lifelong non-smokers with partners who smoke in the home have a 20–30% greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who live with non-smokers. Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke in the workplace have an increased lung cancer risk of 16–19%. A study issued in 2002 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens on account of tobacco smoke as active smokers. Sidestream smoke contains 69 known carcinogens, particularly benzopyrene and other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and radioactive decay products, such as polonium-210. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in second-hand smoke than in mainstream smoke. Scientific organisations confirming the effects of second-hand smoke include the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Surgeon General of the United States, and the World Health Organization.

As a result, statistics indicate that the public took notice of this health advisory, since smoking decreased by 5% several months following the report. Congressional action followed during the next several years with the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 and the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970. This legislation resulted in health warnings on cigarette boxes, and prevention of broadcast cigarette advertisements. Additionally, in 1983 the federal cigarette tax doubled (the last cigarette tax increase occurred over 30 years earlier to support the Korean War).

Specifically, 23% had one or more viruses, 11% had one or more bacteria, 3% had both bacterial and viral pathogens, and 1% had a fungal or mycobacterial infection. "The most common pathogens were human rhinovirus (in 9% of patients), influenza virus (in 6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 5%)."

Testing pregnant women for Group B Streptococcus and Chlamydia trachomatis, and administering antibiotic treatment, if needed, reduces rates of pneumonia in infants; preventive measures for HIV transmission from mother to child may also be efficient. Suctioning the mouth and throat of infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid has not been found to reduce the rate of aspiration pneumonia and may cause potential harm, thus this practice is not recommended in the majority of situations. In the frail elderly good oral health care may lower the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Zinc supplementation in children 2 months to five years old appears to reduce rates of pneumonia. For people

['A new study by Rutgers University researchers has shown that a simple blood test could help diagnose schizophrenia in as little as 15 minutes, a major breakthrough in the field.\nThe study, published in the journal Schizophrenia Research, found that a blood test could identify the presence of schizophrenia with 80 percent accuracy, compared to the current standard of diagnosis, which can take weeks or even months.\nThe test, developed by researchers at Rutgers\' New Jersey Medical School, measures the levels of 10 different proteins in the blood. These proteins are involved in the brain\'s communication system, and their levels are altered in people with schizophrenia.\nThe study involved 100 patients with schizophrenia and 100 healthy controls. The researchers found that the blood test was able to accurately identify the presence of schizophrenia in 80 percent of cases, compared to the current standard of diagnosis, which is based on a combination of clinical interviews and psychological tests.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Anjali Rajadhyaksha, said that the blood test could help speed up the diagnosis of schizophrenia, which is currently a lengthy and expensive process.\n"Currently, diagnosing schizophrenia can take weeks or even months, and it can be a very expensive process,"', 'Promise of faster, more accessible schizophrenia diagnosis, Rutgers study shows']

  These are the current criteria: "Slowly progressive development over a period of at least one year, of all three of the following: (a) A significant and consistent change in the overall quality of some aspects of personal behaviour, manifest as loss of drive and interests, aimlessness, idleness, a self-absorbed attitude and social withdrawal. (b) Gradual appearance and deepening of negative symptoms such as marked apathy, paucity of speech, underactivity, blunting of affect, passivity and lack of initiative, and poor non-verbal communication. (c) Marked decline in social, scholastic or occupational performance. 2. Absence, at any time, of any symptoms referred to in G1 in F20.0 - F20.3 and of hallucinations or well formed delusions of any kind, i.e. the subject must never have met the criteria for any other type of schizophrenia, or any other psychotic disorder. 3. Absence of evidence of dementia or any other organic mental disorder." The ICD is currently in revision 10, and the ICD-11 was accepted in May 2019 will come into effect in 2022. In the ICD-11, there is no longer a diagnostic category of simple schizophrenia, and all subtypes of schizophrenia have been eliminated.

  Simple-type schizophrenia also appeared in the first two editions of the DSM as an official diagnosis: "This psychosis is characterized chiefly by a slow and insidious reduction of external attachments and interests and by apathy and indifference leading to impoverishment of interpersonal relations, mental deterioration, and adjustment on a lower level of functioning. In general, the condition is less dramatically psychotic than are the hebephrenic, catatonic, and paranoid types of schizophrenia. Also, it contrasts with schizoid personality, in which there is little or no progression of the disorder." But after that, it was omitted in later versions and has since then never returned as a formal diagnosis in any DSM. However, DSM-IV (1994) and DSM-IV-TR (2000) included Simple

  The early idea that a person with schizophrenia might present solely with symptoms and indications of deterioration (i.e. presenting with no accessory symptoms ) was identified as dementia simplex. ICD-10 specifies the continuation of symptoms for a period of two years in the diagnosis of simple schizophrenia. This is because of disagreement on the classification validity of the sub-type, that having been retained by the ICD classification, has been omitted from DSM classifications. Symptoms identified earlier to dementia simplex are now DSM-attributed by way of improvements in diagnostic technique to other classifications such as neurodegenerative disorders. Early observations that concur with symptoms of the dementia praecox of the form classified later as

Researchers checked for three different signs in their patients: psychosis-risk symptoms present at baseline (these plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism), onset of psychosis during the two and a half-year follow-along period of NAPLS-1, and psychotic disorder diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The study showed that people in early adolescence who showed poor social indicators were four times as likely to develop schizophrenia. Those in their late adolescence with poor social indicators were five times as likely to develop schizophrenia.

  Simple-type schizophrenia is a sub-type of schizophrenia included in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), in which it is classified as a mental and behaviour disorder. It is not included in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the upcoming ICD-11, effective on the 1st of January 2022. Simple-type schizophrenia is characterized by negative ("deficit") symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, anhedonia, reduced affect display, lack of initiative, lack of motivation, low activity; with absence of hallucinations or delusions of any kind. Simple schizophrenia was included as a proposed diagnosis for further study in the appendix of the former DSM-IV.

  Towards a Psychosis Risk Blood Diagnostic for Persons Experiencing High-Risk Symptoms: In this study, the researchers looked at different analytes found in human blood plasma. These plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism. It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis.

  Definition of this type of schizophrenia is without unity or is controversial. The diagnosis was discontinued in the DSM system, although it was recommended for reinclusion in 1989. It was subsequently confirmed as having imprecise diagnostic criteria based on collective descriptions lacking in agreement. However, in an experiment with a small sample size, five patients with a diagnosis of simple deteriorative disorder (DSM-IV) were found to have grey matter deficits, atrophy and reduced cerebral perfusion in the frontal areas. Whitwell et al. found justification to retain the classification on the basis of fulfillment of "dimensional" considerations of classification, as opposed to criticisms resulting from disagreement in considerations of classification using orientation from other categories.

There is a gradual deterioration of functioning with increased amotivation and reduced socialization. It is considered to be rarely diagnosed and is a schizophrenia without psychotic symptoms. In a study of patients in a Massachusetts hospital, persons suffering with simple schizophrenia were found to make attempts at reality fulfillment with respect to the more primitive needs; tending toward the achievement of fulfillment of these needs rather than engaging in fantasy as is typically found as a reaction to environmental stimuli by the psychotic person.

  Schizophrenia is primarily characterized by psychosis (hallucinations and delusions) and symptoms of cognitive debilitation such as erratic speech, lost interest in normal activities and disordered thinking. It is the most extreme condition of the schizophrenia or psychosis spectrum, which includes schizotypy and other psychotic disorders, arguably extending to unusual experiences such as perceiving ghosts or believing in magic which are common in the population. Schizophrenia is a heritable condition, prevalent in slightly less than 1% of the population, with negative effects of fecundity, especially in men. Because of this, it was perhaps the first psychiatric condition explicitly raised as specifically requiring an evolutionary explanation,

It was subsequently confirmed as having imprecise diagnostic criteria based on collective descriptions lacking in agreement. However, in an experiment with a small sample size, five patients with a diagnosis of simple deteriorative disorder (DSM-IV) were found to have grey matter deficits, atrophy and reduced cerebral perfusion in the frontal areas. Whitwell et al. found justification to retain the classification on the basis of fulfillment of "dimensional" considerations of classification, as opposed to criticisms resulting from disagreement in considerations of classification using orientation from other categories.

In general, the condition is less dramatically psychotic than are the hebephrenic, catatonic, and paranoid types of schizophrenia. Also, it contrasts with schizoid personality, in which there is little or no progression of the disorder."

It is not included in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the upcoming ICD-11, effective on the 1st of January 2022. Simple-type schizophrenia is characterized by negative ("deficit") symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, anhedonia, reduced affect display, lack of initiative, lack of motivation, low activity; with absence of hallucinations or delusions of any kind. Simple schizophrenia was included as a proposed diagnosis for further study in the appendix of the former DSM-IV.

ICD-10 specifies the continuation of symptoms for a period of two years in the diagnosis of simple schizophrenia. This is because of disagreement on the classification validity of the sub-type, that having been retained by the ICD classification, has been omitted from DSM classifications.

['In the House Republican health care bill, "we’re expanding women’s access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers, which vastly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nThis means that women will have more options for care, and will no longer be forced to go to Planned Parenthood for basic health services. Community health centers provide a wide range of services, including preventative care, cancer screenings, and family planning. They also serve low-income and uninsured populations, and are often located in rural or underserved areas.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions to ensure that women continue to have access to essential health services, even if their local Planned Parenthood clinic closes. This is important because Planned Parenthood clinics often serve as a safety net for women who have limited access to other health care providers.\n\nIn addition, the bill includes language that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. This is a significant departure from current law, which allows federal funds to be used for abortions in certain circumstances.\n\nOverall, the House Republican health care bill seeks to expand women’s access to health services while also ensuring that federal funds are not used to support abortions.

  organizations such as Planned Parenthood that perform abortions. Proponents of the bill claim it supports states' rights over federalist rights. The bill was passed under the procedures of the Congressional Review Act. In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. This will be an issue at the end of the first 100 days as Congress tries to avoid a government shutdown. In Fiscal Year 2014, Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the Title X Family Planning grant program. The proposed American Health Care Act, announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood "ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants".

  too closely- [sic]spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions". Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.

  One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council. The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method". They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many

  primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill. Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society". Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".

One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".

The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. Edcel Lagman denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations". 43—HHS Title X Funding for Planned Parenthood Rule— reversing Obama's December 2016 regulation which had mandated that Title X recipients—like states local and state governments—distribute federal funds for services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers, regardless of whether they also perform abortions".

Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported "the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes." The study began after a previous, randomized, clinical trial of testosterone therapy in men was stopped prematurely "due to adverse cardiovascular events raising concerns about testosterone therapy safety."

The FDA has required that testosterone pharmaceutical labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. They have also required the label include concerns about abuse and dependence. Injectable forms of testosterone can cause a lung problem called pulmonary oil microembolism (POME). Symptoms of POME include cough, shortness of breath, tightening of the throat, chest pain, sweating, dizziness, and fainting. A postmarketing analysis by the manufacturer of Aveed (testosterone undeconate injection) found that POME occurred at a rate of less than 1% per injection per year for Aveed.

Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In low- and middle-income countries, valvular heart disease is often attributable to rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other risk factors include excess alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, about half of cases are not associated with any of these aforementioned risks.

Scientists believed many other factors were responsible for the development of lung cancer, such as automobile exhaust, coal fumes, infectious diseases, race, and better diagnostic technologies. Moreover, it was deemed unlikely that a single preventable factor, such as smoking, could alone cause such a complicated outcome like cancer. In the fifty years leading up to the Wynder and Graham study, lung cancer was observed to have risen dramatically and disproportionately in comparison to other cancers. From the 1920s to 1950, the year of the study's publication, deaths from lung cancer had quadrupled so now it was the leading cancer found

["In 2010, the state of Utah had one of the highest abortion rates in the country. The state's Department of Health reported that 14,000 abortions were performed that year, with a rate of 20.5 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. This was significantly higher than the national average of 12.1 per 1,000.\n\nIn response to this high rate, the state government implemented a number of policies aimed at reducing abortions and increasing adoptions. One of the key initiatives was the establishment of the Utah Adoption Exchange, which aimed to connect adoptive families with birth mothers and facilitate the adoption process.\n\nThe results of these policies have been significant. According to the most recent data from the Utah Department of Health, the state's abortion rate has dropped to 10.5 per 1,000 women aged 15-44, a decrease of 48.5%. This is significantly lower than the national average of 12.1 per 1,000.\n\nIn addition to reducing abortions, the state has also seen a significant increase in adoptions. In 2010, there were 240 adoptions in Utah. By 2019, this number had increased to 575, a 135% increase.\n", 'We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent.']

Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. , 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it.

  14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days.

  to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide. The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women per year (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women per year (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and

The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly

  whose statistics were deemed incomplete. An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the birth control pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that "most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women" because minority women "have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR).

  the government denied this, and claimed that it did not intend to question women's right to access safe abortion. Abortion was used as a manner of birth control in Armenia and the number of maternal deaths from abortion complications used to be very high (between 10 and 20% in 2000). After massive reforms, the number of deaths declined to 5% in 2005. In 2014, 21.77% of pregnancies in Armenia ended in abortion, a slight rise from the all-time low recorded in 2010 (21.52%).

One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.).

  risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy; from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more (as measured from the last menstrual period). It appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation (whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage) correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies. The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been

In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that "Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term." Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that "26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion," whereas "deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally."

Annual checkups are used to track the impact of genetic markers, brain images, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors on cognitive changes in the women. The data has shown a link between a human leukocyte antigen and brain health with the HLA-DRB1*13:02 allele correlating with less brain damage and with cognitive health over time. This observation provides a molecular mechanism to explain the widely published observation that infections by certain pathogens, such as herpes virus, contribute to loss of brain function and increased incidence of Alzheimer Disease.

  Functional magnetic resonance imaging looks to the central nervous system to compare time and topography of activity in the brain for lie detection. While a polygraph detects changes in activity in the peripheral nervous system, fMRI has the potential to catch the lie at the 'source'. fMRIs use electromagnets to create pulse sequences in the cells of the brain. The fMRI scanner then detects the different pulses and fields that are used to distinguish tissue structures and the distinction between layers of the brain, matter type, and the ability to see growths. The functional component allows researchers to see activation in the brain over time and assess efficiency and connectivity by comparing blood use in the brain, which allows for the identification of which portions of the brain are using more oxygen, and thus being used during

  the brain. PET scans sense the low-level radiation in the brain and produce 3-D images, whereas an fMRI works on a magnetic signal and is used to “map the brain”. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain’s electrical activity and can identify changes that occur over milliseconds. EEG is often used in patients with epilepsy to detect seizure activity. The principles of cognitive neuropsychology have recently been applied to mental illness, with a view to understanding, for example, what the study of delusions may tell us about the function of normal belief. This relatively young field is known as cognitive neuropsychiatry.

  method for detecting calcification present in plaque. However, the atheroma have to be advanced enough to have relatively large areas of calcification within them to create large enough regions of ~130 Hounsfield units which a CT scanner's software can recognize as distinct from the other surrounding tissues. Typically, such regions start occurring within the heart arteries about 2–3 decades after atheroma start developing. The presence of smaller, spotty plaques may actually be more dangerous for progressing to acute myocardial infarction. Arterial ultrasound, especially of the carotid arteries, with measurement of the thickness of the artery wall, offers a way to partially track the disease

  Cognitive chronometry, or the measurement of the time taken to perform mental operations, can be used to distinguish lying from truth-telling. One recent instrument using cognitive chronometry for this purpose is the timed antagonistic response alethiometer, or TARA. Brain-reading uses fMRI and the multiple voxels activated in the brain evoked by a stimulus to determine what the brain has detected, and so whether it is familiar. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNRI) also detects oxygen and activity in the brain like the fMRI, but instead it looks at blood oxygen levels. It is advantageous to the fMRI because it is portable, however its image resolution is of lower quality than the fMRI. As there are different styles of lying, a spontaneous or artificial deception is constructed based on a mixture of information already stored in semantic and episodic memory. It is isolated and easier to generate because it lacks cross-checking into the larger picture. This style contrasts memorized lies that aren't as rich in detail but are retrieved from memory. They often fit into an actual scenario to make recall easier.

Even though accelerated memory loss is reported in 44% of TEA patients, it is undetected by standard tests of memory. Typically these tests examine the ability to store information for up to 30 minutes but the problem of accelerated long-term forgetting in TEA patients is not generally noticeable at this point.

She would not want to be kept alive by machines.\n"She would want to be allowed to die with dignity and to have her wishes respected."\nThe woman\'s family has been given until 1 December to make a decision about whether to continue life support.\nThe hospital said it was following the woman\'s wishes, as expressed in her living will.\nBut the woman\'s husband said she had not discussed her wishes with him.\nHe said: "She never talked about living wills or anything like that. She never said, \'If this happens, do this\'."\nThe hospital said it', 'Brain-dead Canadian woman kept on life support to save fetus.']

  jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including "risks" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. Many restrictions are waived in emergency situations. China, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy. Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all,

  Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion" and occurs in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion. When properly done, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death, especially in the developing world, while making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. It is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death

On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: "The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical

  Erdoğan is a supporter of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He also called for Israel's nuclear facilities to come under IAEA inspection. Erdoğan accuses Israel of turning Gaza into an "open-air prison". At the 2009 World Economic Forum conference, the debate became heated in relation to the Gaza conflict. The Israeli President Shimon Peres was heavily criticized by Erdogan (sitting beside him) over the handling of the conflict as response to Peres' strong language. Erdoğan also accused the moderator of giving Peres more time than all the other panelists combined. Following the Gaza flotilla raid, tension between the two countries dramatically mounted, when Erdogan strongly condemned the raid, describing it as "state terrorism", calling for Israeli leaders responsible to be punished, and concluding his speech by saying that "we are sick of your [Israel's] lies".

['The global aviation industry is scrambling to adjust to the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak, with airlines around the world canceling flights, slashing capacity and pleading with governments for financial relief.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 260 airlines, said on Monday that the industry\'s financial outlook had deteriorated sharply in the past week, with airlines now expecting a $113 billion hit to revenues in 2020.\n\n"The scale of the crisis is unprecedented," said IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac. "The financial impact on airlines is devastating."\n\nThe association said it expected airlines to post a net loss of $31.4 billion in 2020, compared with a profit of $25.9 billion in 2019.\n\nThe industry\'s financial woes are being compounded by a sharp drop in demand, with airlines canceling thousands of flights and slashing capacity.\n\nIn the United States, the world\'s largest aviation market, airlines have canceled more than 10,000 flights since Friday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.\n\nDelta Air Lines, which has cut capacity by 10% in April, said on Monday it would cut capacity by 70% in May and', 'Airlines rush to boost demand as coronavirus shreds playbook for crisis management.']

  After the lockdown in Hubei, the government owned flag carrier Air India flew to Wuhan to evacuate Indian citizens, particularly students, stranded there.

  The global airline industry continues to grow rapidly, but consistent and robust profitability is elusive. Measured by revenue, the industry has doubled over the past decade, from US$369 billion in 2004 to a projected $746 billion in 2014, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Much of that growth has been driven by low-cost carriers (LCCs), which now control some 25 percent of the worldwide market and which have been expanding rapidly in emerging markets; growth also came from continued gains by carriers in developed markets, the IATA reported. Yet profit margins are still low, less than 3 percent

  Due to the nature of evacuation flights, being flown empty one-way and being arranged by charter airlines in many cases at short notice, many passengers have had to pay substantial fees for a seat. Notably, the U.S. Department of State couldn't show that the prices it charged passengers for some chartered flights complied with its fare policy because it didn't have written guidance for calculating and documenting actual costs. In the United States, a bill was introduced in Congress to propose waiving waiving travel expenses for US citizens evacuated. and in Nigeria, flights have been subsidised by the government. Indian migrant workers also suffered with high prices, which were compounded by their lack of income due to the lockdown and economic downturn. In response, the Jharkhand government and Congress Party branch said it would pay train fares for migrants leaving the state as well as organise special trains for residents to get to their hometowns.

During the pandemic, exports of many food and drink products from the UK declined significantly, and that included Scotch whisky.

["A new study has found that people who received the flu vaccine in 2018-2019 were more likely to contract COVID-19 than those who did not.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, analyzed data from over 1,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Italy between February and May 2020. The researchers found that those who had received the flu vaccine in the previous year were 36% more likely to contract COVID-19 than those who had not.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that the flu vaccine may have weakened the patients' immune systems, making them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, they caution that more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe findings come as a surprise, as previous studies have suggested that the flu vaccine can provide some protection against COVID-19. The authors of the new study note that their findings may be due to the fact that the flu vaccine used in Italy during the 2018-2019 season was less effective than in previous years.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the flu vaccine may have been less effective in older adults, who are at higher risk of both flu and COVID-19. They suggest that future flu vaccines may need to be tailored to older adults to provide better protection against both viruses.\n\nThe study", "New study: The flu vaccine is 'significantly associated' with an increased risk of coronavirus"]

  A study from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where researchers deleted gD-2 from the herpes virus, which is responsible for HSV microbes entering in and out of cells showed as of May 1st, 2018 the same vaccine can be used in a modified way to contain hemagglutinin and invoke a special ADCC immune response. The Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis and the Icahn School of Medicine in Mount Sinai in New York are using the glycoprotein neuraminidase as a targeted antigen in their research. Three monoclonal antibodies (mAB) were sampled from a patient infected with influenza A H3N2 virus. The antibodies were able to bind to the neuraminidase active site neutralizing the virus across multiple strains. The site remains the same with minimal variability across most of the flu strains. In trials using mice all three antibodies were effective across multiple

  one antibody was able to protect the mice from all 12 strains tested including human and non-human flu viruses. All mice used in the experiments survived even if the antibody was not administered until 72 hours after the time of infection. Simultaneously the NIAID is working on a peptide vaccine that is starting human clinical trials in the 2019 flu season. The study will include 10,000 participants who will be monitored for two flu seasons. The vaccine will show efficacy if it is able to reduce the number of influenza cases in all strains. In 2019–2020, a vaccine candidate from Peter Palese's group at Mount Sinai Hospital emerged from a phase 1 clinical trial with positive results. By vaccinating twice with hemagglutinins that have different "heads" but the same membrane-proximal "stalk", the immune system is directed to focus its attention on the conserved stalk.

  New vaccines against currently circulating influenza variants are required every year due to the diversity of flu viruses and variable efficacy of vaccines to prevent them. A universal vaccine would eliminate the need to create a vaccine for each year's variants. The efficacy of a vaccine refers to the protection against a broad variety of influenza strains. Events such as antigenic shift have created pandemic strains such as the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The research required every year to isolate a potential popular viral strain and create a vaccine to defend against it is a six-month-long process; during that time the virus can mutate, making the vaccines less effective. High-risk populations, including the elderly and those with chronic disease, often acquire only limited immunity towards the flu from vaccines. The vaccines have been found to be 30% to 70% effective in preventing hospitalization from the flu or pneumonia. On average influenza vaccine efficacy is 60% among the general population that receive yearly vaccinations. A universal vaccine could be manufactured in quantity and eliminate availability and supply issues of current vaccines. There is conflicting evidence on whether it would cut costs.

The average time taken to produce any other existing vaccine averages to more than a decade’s time due to all the intense research and repeated trials in order to create a safe and working vaccine.

['A human virus that causes respiratory disease has been identified as the cause of death in a number of mountain gorillas in the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to a study published in the journal Science.\nThe virus, known as a human metapneumovirus (hMPV), is common in humans and is usually associated with mild respiratory symptoms. However, in the gorillas, it caused severe pneumonia and killed at least 17 of the 40 gorillas in a group that was being monitored by researchers.\nThe study, which was led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and the University of California, Davis, involved analyzing samples from the gorillas and comparing them to samples from humans and other animals.\nThe researchers found that the virus was closely related to a strain of hMPV that is common in humans in the region. They also found that the virus was able to infect other gorillas in the group, as well as humans who were in close contact with the gorillas.\nThe study highlights the potential for viruses to cross between species and cause outbreaks in wildlife populations. It also underscores the importance of monitoring wildlife populations for signs of disease and taking steps to prevent the spread of viruses between animals and humans.\nThe researchers suggest that the outbreak of hMP', 'Human virus linked to mountain gorilla deaths.']

  Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and a team of researchers in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from simian AIDS in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. Bonobos appear to avoid simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its effects, though it is not known why. African green monkeys (also called vervets, genus Chlorocebus) in African populations are heavily infected with SIVagm, while the virus is absent in the founder isolate

  In 1998, The Zoonotic Importance of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Transmission From Human to Monkey was noticed. In 2001, scientists noticed that antibodies peculiar to humans were found in macaque monkeys, both wild and domesticated. Of the panel of human viruses studied, measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 were found in some of the studied animals. In 2006, scientists noticed HPT of measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in the case of performing monkeys, who are "a common phenomena in Asia". In 2015 and again in 2016, scientists found that HPT likely had occurred in the case of Staphylococcus aureus. In 2018, scientists speculated that HPT was likely to have occurred in the case of human malaria parasites. Also in 2018, scientists speculated that an outbreak of tuberculosis among a closed breeding colony of Aotus monkeys was likely due to continuing intermittent HPT exposure.

  Infection in humans and horses are different. In horses, the virus attacks the central nervous system, causing paralysis and eventual death. When the virus infects humans, symptoms manifest as fever, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and back pain. Humans tend to recover in a few weeks, during which severe symptoms are limited to the first couple days. The case fatality rate for human adults is only 1%, but it is much higher in children, rising to 20%. Horses have a 10% chance of dying from infection. Like most virus infections, there is the normal collection of flu-like symptoms from the immune system fighting back. There is a 4–14% chance of neurological complications developing from infection. Death is usually caused by encephalitis and bleeding in the brain, lungs, or intestines.

 "In order to cause a pandemic, H5N1 viruses will have to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person. The H5 hemagglutinin (HA) is found in influenza viruses that typically infect avian species, so efficient person-to-person spread could happen if the H5N1 virus reassorts, or exchanges genes, with circulating human influenza viruses giving rise to a virus with the H5 HA (to which the population is not immune) in a gene constellation that confers the property of transmissibility. Alternatively, efficient person-to-person spread could occur if the H5N1 virus evolves and adapts to more efficient replication and transmissibility in the human population." H5N1 may cause

  Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen suggest that the success of hominins within Eurasia once out of Africa is in part due to the absence of zoonotic diseases outside their original habitat. Zoonotic diseases are those that are transmitted from animals to humans. While a disease specific to hominins must keep its human host alive long enough to transmit itself, zoonotic diseases will not necessarily do so as they can complete their life cycle without humans. Still, these infections are well accustomed to human presence, having evolved alongside them. The higher an African ape's population density, the better a disease fares. 55% of chimps at the Gombe reserve die of disease, most of them zoonotic. The majority of these diseases are still restricted to hot and damp African environments. Once hominins had moved out into drier and colder habitats of higher latitudes, one major limiting factor in population growth was out of the equation.

  In spring of 2012, three miners working in an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, south China, developed fatal pneumonia. Samples were brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology where Shi Zhengli and her colleagues ran PCR tests finding that the samples were not the bat coronavirus Rp3 nor SARS-CoV2. Mammal species present in the cave including Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rattus flavipectus, and Crocidura dracula were tested for infectious virus and viral RNA. There were 38 sequence reads obtained closely related to members of the Henipavirus genus. Infectious virus could only be recovered from 4 samples of R. flavipectus and were cultured in Vero E6, BHK-21, and HEp-2 cells. While no person-to-person transmission was documented, the full range of mammalian hosts susceptible Mòjiāng virus is unknown. While Hendra, Nipah, Cedar, Kumasi, and Madagascar henipaviruses are known to be harbored among chiropterans, primarily Pteropus spp, MojV is the only henipavirus believed to be found primarily in rodents.

Gerberding, director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, estimated that there had been "at least three." On May 30, Maria Cheng, a WHO spokeswoman, said there were "probably about half a dozen," but that no one "has got a solid number." The cases of suspected human to human transmission that continue to be found have been isolated and contained, and include transmission among members of a family in Sumatra, Indonesia in June 2006 as well as earlier and

  Acute urinary retention is treated by placement of a urinary catheter (small thin flexible tube) into the bladder. This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place. Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional or by the person themselves (clean intermittent self catheterization). Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique. Patients can be taught to use a self catheterization technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters.

The leukocyte esterase test indirectly detects the presence of leukocytes (white blood cells) in urine which can be associated with a urinary tract infection. In the elderly, the leukocyte esterase test is often positive even in the absence of an infection. The urine dipstick test is readily available and provides fast, but often unreliable results. ; Microscopy can also be used to detect bacteriuria. It is rarely used in clinical routine since it requires more time and equipment and does not allow reliable identification or

  Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in urine. Bacteriuria accompanied by symptoms is a urinary tract infection while that without is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria. Diagnosis is by urinalysis or urine culture. Escherichia coli is the most common bacterium found. People without symptoms should generally not be tested for the condition. Differential diagnosis include contamination. If symptoms are present treatment is generally with antibiotics. Bacteriuria without symptoms generally does not require treatment. Exceptions may include pregnant women, those who have had a recent kidney transplant, young children with significant vesicoureteral reflux, and those undergoing surgery of the urinary tract. Bacteriuria without symptoms is present in about 3% of otherwise healthy middle aged women. In nursing homes rates are as high as 50% among women and 40% in men. In those with a long term indwelling urinary catheter rates are 100%. Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of all women have at least one infection at some point in their lives.

  flora. Therefore, in research, usually a second specimen is analysed to confirm asymptomatic bacteriuria in women. For urine collected via bladder catheterization in men and women, a single urine specimen with greater than 100,000 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre is considered diagnostic. The threshold for women displaying UTI symptoms can be as low as 100 colony forming units of a single species per millilitre. However, bacteria below a threshold of 10000 colony forming units per millilitre are usually reported as "no growth" by clinical laboratories. Using special techniques certain non-disease causing bacteria have also been found in the urine of healthy people. These are part of the resident microbiota.

  bladder capacity. If fluid intake/outflow is around 1.5 litres per day, this would typically be performed roughly three times per day, i.e. roughly every six to eight hours during the day, more frequently when fluid intake is higher and/or bladder capacity lower. For acute urinary retention, treatment requires urgent placement of a urinary catheter. A permanent urinary catheter may cause discomfort and pain that can last several days. Older people with ongoing problems may require continued intermittent self catheterization (CISC). CISC has a lower infection risk compared to catheterization techniques that stay within the body. Challenges with CISC include compliance issues as some people may not be able to place the catheter themselves.

In August 2007, CMS announced that it will stop payments to hospitals for several negative consequences of care that result in injury, illness or death. This rule, effective October 2008, would reduce hospital payments for eight serious types of preventable incidents: objects left in a patient during surgery, blood transfusion reaction, air embolism, falls,

['A new study has found that regular visits to a barbershop could help lower blood pressure in African American men.\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Hypertension, found that men who received blood pressure screenings and counseling at their local barbershop had significantly lower blood pressure readings than those who received care through traditional channels.\nThe study, which was conducted in 10 barbershops in the Atlanta area, enrolled 1,000 men between the ages of 40 and 75. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or an intervention group.\nMen in the intervention group received blood pressure screenings and counseling at their local barbershop, while those in the control group received care through traditional channels.\nThe study found that men in the intervention group had an average blood pressure reading of 132/80, compared to 140/86 in the control group.\nThe study\'s authors say that the findings could have significant implications for public health, as African American men are at a higher risk for hypertension and related health problems.\n"This study shows that barbershops can be a valuable resource for providing blood pressure screenings and counseling to African American men," said Dr. Lisa Powell, lead author of the study. "By partnering with barbershops, we can reach men where they are and help them make lifestyle changes', 'How barbershops could help lower blood pressure']

Except for the bass, the voice parts in barbershop singing do not correspond closely to their classical music counterparts; the tenor range and tessitura are similar to those of the classical countertenor, the baritone resembles the Heldentenor or lyric baritone in range and a tenor in tessitura, and the lead generally corresponds to the tenor of classical repertoire, with some singers possessing a tessitura more similar to that of a high baritone.

  While the modern era of barbershop music is accepted to have begun with a 1940s revival, opinions as to the genre's origins vary with respect to race, gender, region and context. Historical memoirs and journalism indicate a strong tradition of quartet singing among young African American men, gathering informally to "crack up a chord". This was acknowledged as early as 1882, when a New York Age writer traced the development of this singing as a home-grown amusement, arising from the exclusion of Blacks from theaters and concert halls. Jazz musician Louis Armstrong told of having harmonized on New Orleans street corners as a boy, and NAACP executive secretary James Weldon Johnson "grew up singing barbershop harmony". English "barber's music" was described in

The researchers measured cortisol levels in the children\'s hair at ages 2, 5, and 8.\n\nThe results showed that children with higher cortisol levels at age 2 were more likely to develop depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems by the time they reached adolescence. The researchers also found that children with higher cortisol levels at age 5 were more likely to develop depression and anxiety by age 18.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Brendan N.

  Foster children have elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in comparison to children raised by their biological parents. Elevated cortisol levels can compromise the immune system.

Negative environmental influences during this critical period of brain development can have lifelong consequences.

Children with high cortisol reactivity were rated by teachers as least prosocial when living under adverse conditions, but most prosocial when living under more benign conditions (and in comparison to children scoring low on cortisol reactivity). Regarding characteristics of the category of Phenotypic Factors, Pluess and Belsky (2009) reported that the effect of child care quality on teacher-rated socioemotional adjustment varied as a function of infant temperament in the case of 761 4.5-year-olds participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005). Children with difficult temperaments as infants manifest the most and least behavior problems depending on whether they experienced, respectively, poor or good quality care (and in comparison to children with easier temperaments).

  from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, stimulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release into the blood stream. From here ACTH triggers the release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol, known as the main stress hormone, creates a negative feedback loop back to the hypothalamus to deactivate the stress response. When a constant stressor is present, the HPA axis remains overactivated and cortisol is constantly produced. This chronic stress is associated with sustained CRF release, resulting in the increased production of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and serving as a potential mechanism for differences in prevalence between men and women.

Sex Differences Mood disorders, specifically stress-related mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, have been shown to have differing rates of diagnosis based on sex. In the United States, women are two times more likely than men to be diagnosed with a stress-related mood disorder. Underlying these sex differences, studies have shown a dysregulation of stress-responsive neuroendocrine function causing an increase in the likelihood of developing these affective disorders. Overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis could provide potential insight into how these sex differences arise. Neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is

The effects of PPNAD can often be cyclical so the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome will not always be as severe, which may complicate diagnosis. The classic symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include rapid central weight gain, a puffy red face and a buffalo hump at the back of the neck due to fat deposits. Skin changes in Cushing's syndrome include thinning and bruising easily, developing striae and hyperpigmentation at skin folds. The hormonal changes can lead to hirsutism, males developing breast tissue, females no longer having periods and both sexes may become infertile.

The effects of PPNAD can often be cyclical so the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome will not always be as severe, which may complicate diagnosis. The classic symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include rapid central weight gain, a puffy red face and a buffalo hump at the back of the neck due to fat deposits. Skin changes in Cushing's syndrome include thinning and bruising easily, developing striae and hyperpigmentation at skin folds. The hormonal changes can lead to hirsutism, males developing breast tissue, females no longer having periods and both sexes may become infertile. High cortisol levels can lead to psychological disturbances such as anxiety or depression and insomnia. Bone health can deteriorate, leading to an

According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.

  On 1 April, two United States officials said that China had deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community. The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and declined to detail its contents. The sources stated that the Chinese central government does not know the extent of the outbreak because lower-level officials reported falsified statistics to avoid losing their positions. The CIA is currently investigating in China to assess the COVID-19 totals. During the pandemic, no reports of cases of the COVID-19 in Xinjiang prisons or of conditions in

In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment. However, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people

  Pneumonia is due to infections caused primarily by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites. Although more than 100 strains of infectious agents have been identified, only a few are responsible for the majority of cases. Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in roughly 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults. A causative agent may not be isolated in about half of cases despite careful testing. In an active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville from January 2010 through June 2012, 2259 patients were identified who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens that could be tested for the

Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China." On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted.

["A new cancer treatment that has been hailed as a breakthrough by some doctors has been met with skepticism by others. The treatment, which involves injecting a patient's own immune cells into their body, has shown promising results in early trials. However, some experts are concerned about the potential side effects and the high cost of the treatment.\n\nThe treatment, known as CAR-T cell therapy, involves removing T cells, a type of immune cell, from a patient's blood and modifying them in a lab to better target cancer cells. The modified cells are then infused back into the patient's body, where they can attack the cancer cells.\n\nIn a recent study, CAR-T cell therapy was shown to have a response rate of 82% in patients with a type of leukemia called acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The treatment also resulted in complete remission in 58% of patients.\n\nHowever, some doctors are concerned about the potential side effects of the treatment. In the same study, 45% of patients experienced a serious adverse event, and 17% died within 30 days of receiving the treatment.\n\nThe high cost of the treatment is also a concern. The treatment can cost up to $500,000, and insurance coverage for the treatment is still limited.\n\nDespite these concerns", 'Some Doctors Question New Cancer Treatment']

   Alternative cancer treatment describes any cancer treatment or practice that is not part of the conventional standard of cancer care. These include special diets and exercises, chemicals, herbs, devices, and manual procedures. Most alternative cancer treatments do not have high-quality evidence supporting their use. Concerns have been raised about the safety of some of them. Some have even been found to be unsafe in certain settings. Despite this, many untested and disproven treatments are used around the world. Promoting or marketing such treatments is illegal in most of the developed world. Alternative cancer treatments are typically contrasted with experimental cancer treatments

  People who are drawn to alternative treatments tend to believe that evidence-based medicine is extremely invasive or ineffective, while still hoping that their own health could be improved. They are loyal to their alternative healthcare providers and believe that "treatment should concentrate on the whole person". Among people who (correctly or incorrectly) believe their condition is untreatable, "desperation drives them into the hands of anyone with a promise and a smile." Con artists have long exploited patients' perceived lack of options to extract payments for ineffectual and even harmful treatments. No evidence suggests that the use of alternative treatments improves survival. In 2017, one retrospective, observational study suggested that people who chose alternative medicine instead of conventional treatments were more than twice as likely to die within five years of diagnosis.

  Treatment of lung cancer refers to the use of medical therapies, such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, percutaneous ablation, and palliative care,  alone or in combination, in an attempt to cure or lessen the adverse impact of malignant neoplasms originating in lung tissue. Lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous family of malignant neoplasms, and well over 50 different histopathological variants are currently recognized under the most widely used typing system. Because these variants have differing genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to treatment, correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management. Approximately 95% of lung cancers are carcinoma, or tumors derived from transformed cells of epithelial lineage. Currently, nearly four dozen different histopathological variants of lung carcinoma are recognized. For clinical and treatment purposes, however, most oncologists tend to classify lung carcinomas into two major groups, namely small

Some experts note that CT scans are known to be "overused," and "there is distressingly little evidence of better health outcomes associated with the current high rate of scans." On the other hand, a recent paper analyzing the data of patients who received high cumulative doses showed a high degree of appropriate use. This creates an important issue of cancer risk to these patients. Moreover, a highly significant finding that was previously unreported is that some patients received

  cures for cancer, rather than being hidden, are not the cures they are initially touted to be by the media and either result in a dead end, further research goals, or a decrease in the mortality rate for a specific type of cancer. Dave Roos and Oliver Childs have criticized the idea that holding back a cure for cancer would result in more profit than presenting one. Dina Fine Maron further notes that this view largely ignores the fact that cancer is not a single disease but instead many, and the fact that large strides have been made in the fight against cancer.

Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests and bone marrow examination. ALL is typically treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at bringing about remission. This is then followed by further chemotherapy typically over a number of years. Treatment usually also include intrathecal chemotherapy since systemic chemotherapy can have limited penetration into the central nervous system and the central nervous system is a common site for relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Treatment can also include radiation therapy if spread to the brain has occurred. Stem cell transplantation may be used if the disease recurs following standard treatment.

The immunotherapy provided by the clinic uses dendritic cells, but very little had been published on the use of dendritic cells to treat DIPG. Siller and Garcia have not published their protocol for treatment. They characterize their approach as tailoring the treatment to each child. Surgical oncologist and outspoken opponent of alternative medicine, David Gorski has criticized this approach, stating "In other words, we make it up as we go along and can’t tell you how we do it in a sufficiently clear manner to make it possible to write a protocol to do it in a clinical trial." The clinic has also been criticized for discouraging their patients from using radiation therapy.

Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China." On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted.

  New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in

  On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause" that same evening. Eight of these doctors, including

  that the Chinese government had deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths,  but these claims are yet to be proven and contradict a 2021 academic study. The local governments of Wuhan and Hubei were widely criticized for their delayed responses to the virus and their censorship of the related information during the initial outbreak, especially during the local parliamentary sessions. This allowed early spread of the virus, as a large number of Chinese people returned home for the Chinese New Year vacation from and through Wuhan, a major transportation hub. However, stringent measures such as lockdown of Wuhan and the wider

  early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.

  published on 31 December. On 8 January 2020, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of the pneumonia by Chinese scientists. During the pandemic, the Chinese government has shown a pattern of secrecy and top-down control. It censored discussions about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread, from as early as 1 January,  worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis – which included the detention of several citizen journalists  –  and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light, and restricted and facilitated investigations probing the origins of COVID-19.

  The virus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This outbreak has since caused a health issue in the city of Wuhan, China which evolved into a global pandemic. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Epidemiologists have also warned of the virus's contagiousness. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among

The outbreak went unnoticed until 26 December 2019, when Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, noticed a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin, several of whom had connections to the Huanan Seafood Market. She subsequently alerted the hospital, as well as municipal and provincial health authorities, which issued an alert on 30 December. Results from patient samples obtained on 29–30 December indicated the presence of a novel coronavirus, related to SARS.

  have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak.

Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China." On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted.

The outbreak went unnoticed until 26 December 2019, when Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, noticed a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin, several of whom had connections to the Huanan Seafood Market. She subsequently alerted the hospital, as well as municipal and provincial health authorities, which issued an alert on 30 December. Results from patient samples obtained on 29–30 December indicated the presence of a novel coronavirus, related to SARS. On 1 January 2020, Jianghan District's Health Agency and Administration for Market Regulation closed down the seafood market and collected samples for testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first

Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC

["Viscosupplementation is a non-surgical treatment for knee osteoarthritis that involves injecting a hyaluronic acid-based solution into the knee joint. This treatment is recommended for appropriate patients who have not responded to other conservative treatments, such as physical therapy and medication.\n\nThe procedure is typically performed in a doctor's office or outpatient facility. The patient lies on their back with their knee bent, and the injection is administered through a needle inserted into the knee joint. The procedure is relatively painless and takes only a few minutes to complete.\n\nThe hyaluronic acid solution used in viscosupplementation is a natural substance found in the synovial fluid that lubricates and cushions the joint. The solution helps to reduce pain and stiffness in the knee joint, allowing for greater mobility and function.\n\nViscosupplementation is typically recommended for patients who have moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis that has not responded to other conservative treatments. The treatment is particularly beneficial for patients who are not candidates for surgery or who prefer to avoid surgery.\n\nThe benefits of viscosupplementation include reduced pain and stiffness, improved joint function, and a decreased need for medication. The treatment is also associated with a low risk of complications and side effects.\n\nHowever, viscosupplementation is not a cure for knee osteoarthritis, and", 'Viscosupplementation Recommended For Appropriate Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis']

  Hyaluronic acid (hyaluronan, HA) is naturally occurring component of synovial fluid and the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage. It is produced by the synovial membrane and makes the synovial fluid viscous, lubricates the joint, and affects compressibility of articular cartilage. It may also have some effect on the solute content and white blood cell concentration within the joint fluid. HA is commonly injected intra-articular (IA) into diseased joints, but its exact mechanism of action is unknown. HA concentration and molecular weight are sometimes lower in diseased joints, but this is not always the case. Exogenously administered HA has a half-life of 96 hours in normal joints but is shorter in diseased joints. It is hypothesized that a portion of HA localizes in the joint and increases metabolism of synoviocytes. High molecular weight HA has been shown to offer better protection of articular cartilage than low molecular weight, and longer duration of soundness in horses with arthritis.

  Further research is required to determine if transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain. Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Evidence of benefit is tentative. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. The FDA has not approved PEMFT for the treatment of arthritis. In Canada, PEMF devices are legally licensed by Health Canada for the treatment of pain associated with arthritic conditions.

  Intra-articular use of PSGAGs has been shown to improve lameness, signs of arthritis, joint effusion, and synovial fluid quality. However, mixed results have been reported on its ability to actually repair cartilaginous defects present at time of injection. IA use of PSGAGs may have an increased risk of Staphylococcus aureus infections within the joint when compared to intra-articular injections of other substances, although this can be prevented by concurrently injecting aminoglycoside antibiotics.

  Various neutraceuticals (supplements) are available for equine joint health. Although these products are evaluated for safety, they are not required to prove efficacy, and actual scientific support of their benefits for osteoarthritis in horses are poor. This includes studies on supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Because they are not regulated, joint supplements are not required to contain what has been listed on the label. Additionally, oral joint supplements may have questionable bioavailability. However, these products are still popular, with anecdotal support for their use, and have little downside for use except for cost to the owner.

  Polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (PSGAGs) are drugs originally labeled for intra-articular use, but are commonly given intramuscularly to horses. They have a chondroprotective effect and are given to try to prevent or slow cartilage destruction in cases of osteoarthritis, and are often used in cases of cartilage damage of a joint. PSGAGs have been shown to have several beneficial effects on the joint: they inhibit enzymes that break down cartilage,   inhibit the production of prostaglandin E2, increase glycosaminoglycan production, and may increase hyaluronic acid production. The degree of these effects in horses after intramuscular injection has relatively little support in the current literature. However, there is much anecdotal evidence of their benefits for synovitis and osteoarthritis, and PSGAGs are very commonly used by veterinarians in the United States involved in racehorse and show horse practice. PSGAG is sold under the trade name Adequan. It is a mix of low-molecular weight glycosaminoglycans made from bovine trachea and lung. It is labeled to be used every 4 days, for a total of 7 doses.

  swelling. Depending on the mechanism of injury, joint involvement, and severity, most sprains can be treated using conservative measures following the acronym RICE within the first 24 hours of sustaining an injury. However, it is important to recognize that treatments should be individualized depending on the patient's particular injury and symptoms. Over-the-counter medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help relieve pain, and topical NSAIDs can be as effective as medications taken by mouth.  Other non-operative therapies including the continuous passive motion machine (moves joint without patient exertion) and cryocuff (type of cold compress that is activated similarly to a blood pressure cuff) have been effective in reducing swelling and improving range of motion.

By neutralizing the shear forces in the stifle caused by a ruptured or weakened CrCL, the joint becomes more stable without compromising joint congruency. TTA appears to be a less invasive procedure than some other techniques for stabilizing the deficient cranial cruciate ligament such as TPLO (Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy) and TWO (Tibial Wedge Osteotomy), as TTA does not disrupt the primary loading axis of the tibia. Since KYON first developed the TTA procedure, they have pioneered a new less invasive version of the procedure known as TTA-II.

['In a groundbreaking new study, scientists have successfully grown viable vaginas from girls\' own cells. The research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, could offer a new treatment for girls born without a vagina, or who have lost theirs due to injury or disease.\n\nThe team, led by Dr. Carl-Johan Sundberg at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, used skin cells from the girls to create vaginal tissue in the lab. They then transplanted the tissue into mice, where it developed into fully functional vaginas.\n\nThe researchers say that the technique could be used to create vaginas for girls born without them, as well as for girls who have lost theirs due to injury or disease.\n\n"This is a major breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine," said Dr. Sundberg. "We have shown that it is possible to create functional vaginal tissue from a patient\'s own cells, which could offer a new treatment for girls who are born without a vagina or who have lost theirs due to injury or disease."\n\nThe researchers say that the technique could also be used to create vaginas for girls who have undergone gender reassignment surgery.\n\n"This is an important step forward in the field of regenerative medicine, and could offer a new treatment for girls who are born without a vagina or who have lost theirs due to injury or disease,"', "Scientists grow viable vaginas from girls' own cells."]

  In April 2014, a team of scientists led by Anthony Atala reported that they had successfully transplanted laboratory-grown vaginas into four female teenaged girls with a rare medical condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome that causes the vagina to develop improperly, or sometimes not at all. Between 1 of 1,500 to 4,000 females are born with this condition. The four patients began treatment between May 2005 and August 2008. In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Vaginal-lining cells were

  on the inside of the tube, while muscle cells were attached to the outside. Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. After about eight years, all four patients reported normal function and pleasure levels during sexual intercourse according to the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire, a validated self-report tool. No adverse results or complications were reported. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible. No pregnancies were reported, however, during the study period. Martin Birchall, who works on tissue engineering, but was not involved in

Commentary published by the National Health Service (NHS) called the study "an important proof of concept" and said it showed that tissue engineering had "a great deal of potential." However, the NHS also cautioned that the sample size was very small and further research was necessary to determine the general viability of the technique. The laboratory-grown autologous transplant technique could also be used on women who want reconstructive surgery due to cancer or other disease once the technique is perfected. However, more studies will need to be conducted and the techniques further developed before commercial production can begin.

  self-renewal and cell proliferation during puberty led to stem cell enrichment. In contrast epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the model was shown to increase stem cell frequency not only in pubertal mammary glands but also in adult glands. This latter prediction, however, contradicted the in vivo data; irradiation of adult mammary glands did not lead to increased stem cell frequency. These simulations therefore suggested self-renewal as the primary mechanism behind pubertal stem cell increase. To further evaluate self-renewal as the mechanism, a second agent-based model was created to simulate the growth dynamics of human mammary epithelial cells (containing stem/progenitor and differentiated cell subpopulations) in

  Vaginal aplasia is a rare medical condition in which the vagina does not form properly before birth. Sufferers of the condition may have a partially formed vagina, or none at all. The condition is typically treated by reconstructive surgery. First a space is surgically created where the vagina would typically exist. Then tissue from another part of the body is harvested, molded into the shape of a vagina, and grafted into the vagina cavity. This technique has significant drawbacks. Typically, the implanted tissue does not function normally as a muscle, which can lead to low enjoyment of sexual intercourse. Additionally, stenosis (narrowing of the cavity) can occur over time. Most women require multiple surgeries before a satisfactory result is achieved. An alternative to traditional reconstructive surgery is transplantation.

  to make good facsimiles of culturally intelligible bodies." Contrary to the belief that physicians thought it was vital to immediately decide a sex for an intersex child, evidence shows that just because science chooses a sex for a child that does not guarantee that the child will grow up to "fit" that gender role. For example, the article states, "These individuals seemed to be listening to some inner voice that said that everyone in authority surrounding h/her was wrong. Doctors and parents might have insisted that they were female, removed their testes, injected them with estrogen, and surgically provided them with a vagina, but still, they

The first agent-based model is a multiscale model of mammary gland development starting with a rudimentary mammary ductal tree at the onset of puberty (during active proliferation) all the way to a full mammary gland at adulthood (when there is little proliferation).

  In a handful of cases, a woman with vaginal aplasia has received a successful vagina transplant donated by her mother. The first such case is believed to have occurred in 1970, with no signs of rejection taking place after three years. In at least one case, a woman who received such a transplant was able to conceive and give birth. In 1981, a 12-year-old girl with vaginal aplasia received a vaginal wall implant from her mother. She became sexually active seven years later, without incident. At age 24, she conceived and carried a child to term. The child was born via cesarean section.

They extracted DNA from the myocardium of these research subjects and found that cardiomyocytes do in fact renew at a slowing rate of 1% per year from the age of 25, to 0.45% per year at the age of 75. This amounts to less than half of the original cardiomyocytes being replaced during the average lifespan. However, serious doubts have been placed

  After the events in "Twenty Vicodin", House is two months into the additional eight added to his sentence. However, Eric Foreman (who is now the new Dean of Medicine, because Cuddy resigned the day after the events of "Moving On") makes House an offer: he would receive the opportunity for conditional release and return to the PPTH team to treat a set of donor lungs that are failing, organs that Wilson's patient (Liza Snyder) needs.

  An elderly couple, John and Marie Holt, visit a medical center specializing in a new technology: trading aged bodies in for younger models. The center representative, Mr. Vance, tells them that 98% of couples have been happy with the quality of the swap, but the company offers a guarantee that if they change their mind afterwards within one week, the swap procedure can be reversed. The swap costs $5,000 per body. John and Marie have only $5,000, and government regulations prohibit extension of credit for the procedure. Since John's health problems and constant physical pain make a body swap particularly imperative for him, Marie suggests that he alone do it, but John refuses to go through

Dwight and Jessie provide blood for Thomas by routinely murdering strangers, mainly homeless people and drifters. Jessie works as a waitress in a local diner, while Dwight spends his days pawning items he finds around town and visiting a prostitute who he pays extra for a few minutes conversation after their liaisons. After a particularly grisly murder, Dwight begs Jessie to get real medical help for Thomas. She refuses and instead orders Dwight to procure a new victim. He lures

['A new study has found that osteoporosis drugs can help prevent fractures in people with the disease.\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that people taking osteoporosis drugs had a 40% lower risk of fractures compared to those not taking the drugs.\nThe study followed over 10,000 people with osteoporosis for an average of 3.5 years. The researchers found that those taking osteoporosis drugs had a 38% lower risk of hip fractures and a 41% lower risk of spine fractures.\nThe study also found that the benefits of osteoporosis drugs were greatest in people with the highest risk of fractures.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. John A. Kanis, said that the results "provide strong evidence that osteoporosis drugs are effective in preventing fractures in people with osteoporosis."\nThe study\'s findings are consistent with previous research, which has also shown that osteoporosis drugs can help prevent fractures.\nHowever, the study\'s authors note that the benefits of osteoporosis drugs must be weighed against the potential risks, which can include side effects such as bone pain and an increased risk of blood clots.\nThe study\'s authors also note that the benefits of osteoporosis drugs may', 'More support for osteoporosis drugs']

  After initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density, several studies demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1,523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture. A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K (a vitamin necessary for bone health) and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.

  To prevent low bone density it is recommended to have sufficient calcium and vitamin D. Exercise, especially weight-bearing and resistance exercises are most effective for building bone. Weight-bearing exercise includes walking, jogging, dancing, and hiking. Resistance exercise is often accomplished through lifting weights. Other therapies, such as estrogens (e.g., estradiol, conjugated estrogens), selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., raloxifene, bazedoxifene), and bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronic acid, risedronic acid), can also be used to improve or maintain bone density.

  The effect of protein on osteoporosis and risk of bone fracture is complex. Calcium loss from bone occurs at protein intake below requirement when individuals are in negative protein balance, suggesting that too little protein is dangerous for bone health. IGF-1, which contributes to muscle growth, also contributes to bone growth, and IGF-1 is modulated by protein intake. However, at high protein levels, a net loss of calcium may occur through the urine in neutralizing the acid formed from the deamination and subsequent metabolism of methionine and cysteine. Large prospective cohort studies have shown a slight increase in risk of bone fracture when the quintile of highest protein consumption

  is a simple test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform. It involves taking a specialised X-ray picture of the spine and hips and measuring the bone mineral density and comparing the result to the average value for a young healthy adult in the general population. Adequate calcium levels and, probably, more importantly, vitamin D levels are essential for healthy bone density. Some people with KS/CHH will have their levels checked and may be prescribed extra vitamin D tablets or injections to try to prevent the condition getting worse. The role of vitamin D for general overall health is under close scrutiny at the moment with some researchers claiming vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in many populations and can be linked to other diseases. Some people with severe osteoporosis might be prescribed bisphosphonates to preserve bone mass, in addition to hormone replacement therapy.

  bone is replaced by mature "lamellar" bone. The whole process may take up to 18 months, but in adults, the strength of the healing bone is usually 80% of normal by 3 months after the injury. Several factors may help or hinder the bone healing process. For example, tobacco smoking hinders the process of bone healing, and adequate nutrition (including calcium intake) will help the bone healing process. Weight-bearing stress on bone, after the bone has healed sufficiently to bear the weight, also builds bone strength. Although there are theoretical concerns about NSAIDs slowing the rate of healing, there is not enough evidence to warrant withholding the use of this type analgesic in simple fractures.

['The Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional light bulbs, which are inexpensive, safe, and efficient, in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs. The ban will take effect in 2012, and will be enforced by the EPA. The ban is part of a larger effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which the Democrats believe will prevent catastrophic climate change. However, many experts disagree, and argue that the ban will have little impact on greenhouse gas emissions, while causing significant harm to human health and the environment. The fluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance that can cause neurological damage and other health problems. When the bulbs break, mercury is released into the air, water, and soil, contaminating these resources and posing a serious health risk to humans and wildlife. In addition, the fluorescent bulbs are more expensive than conventional bulbs, and are less reliable and less durable. They also contain hazardous waste, which must be disposed of properly, at a cost to taxpayers. The ban will have a significant impact on consumers, who will be forced to pay more for less reliable and less durable light bulbs. It will also have a significant impact on businesses, which will be forced to replace their conventional light bulbs with more expensive and less reliable fluorescent bulbs. The ban will have a significant impact on the environment, as the', 'The Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional light bulbs ... in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs.']

  Consider a policy proposal to require each of the 100 households in an economy to rent a solar panel that costs $400 per year, net of the value of the energy provided to the user. Suppose each panel would prevent $600 worth of harm from pollution in the economy each year. The pollution is uniformly distributed, so each of the 100 households incurs 1/100 × $600 = $6 worth of the harm that could be avoided by each panel yearly. Although society's $600 annual benefit from each panel exceeds the $400 annual cost, each household only internalizes $6 worth of the environmental benefit—far less than the rental

These permits require sources of pollution to complete a registration process in order to lawfully be able to emit anything considered to be a pollutant. Going along with this, it would no longer be required to report emissions of greenhouse gases." The Act also listed a number of prior agency actions that would have been "...repealed and shall have no legal effect." Essentially this Act would have reversed the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which gave the EPA the power to regulate carbon dioxide.

['A study published in the journal Contraception has found that women who drink more than two cans of Coca-Cola a day are less likely to conceive than those who drink less.\nThe study, which was carried out by the University of California, San Francisco, found that women who drank more than 20 ounces (591ml) of Coca-Cola a day took an average of 2.7 months to conceive, compared with 2.1 months for those who drank less than 12 ounces (355ml) a day.\nThe researchers, led by Dr Janet D Robinson, said that the high levels of caffeine in Coca-Cola could be responsible for the delay in conception.\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can increase heart rate and make muscles tense. It is also a diuretic, which means that it can cause dehydration.\nDr Robinson said: "Caffeine is known to increase the likelihood of infertility in women.\n"It can also increase the likelihood of miscarriage and preterm delivery.\n"Women who are trying to conceive should be aware of the amount of caffeine they are consuming."\nThe study, which is published in the journal Contraception, is based on data collected from 5,583 women who were trying to conceive between ', 'Coca-Cola is an effective contraceptive.']

  Proponents argue that research by the Guttmacher Institute, involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 Ateneo de Manila University professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005).

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines. "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."

Fifty to sixty percent of abortion patients became pregnant in circumstances in which emergency contraceptives could have been used. These emergency contraceptives, including Plan B and EllaOne, became another reproductive rights controversy. Opponents of emergency contraception consider it a form of abortion, because it may interfere with the ability of a fertilized embryo to implant in the uterus; while proponents contend that it is not abortion, because the absence of implantation means that pregnancy never commenced.

One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.).

  Cocaethylene is largely considered a recreational drug in and of itself, with stimulant, euphoriant, anorectic, sympathomimetic, and local anesthetic properties. The monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine play important roles in cocaethylene's action in the brain. Cocaethylene increases the levels of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain by inhibiting the action of the serotonin transporter, norepinephrine transporter, and dopamine transporter. These pharmacological properties make cocaethylene a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI; also known as a "triple reuptake inhibitor"). In most users, cocaethylene produces euphoria and has a longer duration of action than cocaine. Some studies suggest that consuming alcohol in combination with cocaine may be more cardiotoxic than cocaine and "it also carries an 18 to 25 fold increase over cocaine alone in risk of immediate death". Cocaethylene has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter than does cocaine, but has a lower affinity for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. In McCance-Katz et alia's 1993 study cocaethylene "produced greater subjective ratings of 'High' in comparison with administration of cocaine or alcohol alone."

The new information focused on two or more side effects occurring at the same time and causing the potential for irreversible impairment.

The drug safety communication also announced the required labeling updates to reflect this new safety information.

['A new therapy for enlarged prostate may bypass the unpleasant side effects of current treatments, according to a study published in the Journal of Urology.\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that a new drug, called UX023, was effective in reducing the size of the prostate gland in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition that affects more than 40 million men in the United States.\nBPH is a condition in which the prostate gland, which is located near the bladder, becomes enlarged and can cause urinary problems such as frequent urination, difficulty starting and stopping urination, and a weak urine stream.\nCurrent treatments for BPH include medication, surgery, and minimally invasive procedures such as transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT) and transurethral radiofrequency therapy (TURP). However, these treatments can have unpleasant side effects such as erectile dysfunction, ejaculation problems, and urinary incontinence.\nThe new drug, UX023, works by blocking the activity of a protein called androgen receptor (AR), which is involved in the growth of the prostate gland. The drug was tested in a clinical trial involving 1,000 men with BPH. The men were divided', 'New Therapy for Enlarged Prostate May Bypass Unpleasant Side Effects']

  Men with an enlarged prostate may suffer from symptoms of lower urinary tract obstruction, such as sensation of incomplete urination, inability to urinate, weak urinary stream, or having to urinate frequently (often awakening from sleep). If the symptoms cause a significant disruption to quality of life, a man may undergo initial treatment by oral medication, such as alpha-1 receptor blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, or phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitors. Those with severe/progressive symptoms or those who do not experience symptom relief from medication have traditionally been considered for surgical intervention, with transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP as the standard of care. However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Prostatic artery embolization is an emerging treatment alternative which avoids the risks of systemic medication and of surgery. The first report of selective prostatic artery embolization resulting in relief of prostate gland obstruction was published in 2000. Since then, prospective trials with small numbers of patients, up to approximately 200 patients/trial, have been carried out internationally.

  A 2020 Cochrane review of studies involving men over 40 with enlarged prostates and lower urinary tract symptoms found that prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) may work similarly to common surgical options (transurethral resection of the prostate) to relieve symptoms and improve men's quality of life in the short term (up to a year). This review found that PAE may increase the need for retreatment. In the longer term (13–24 months), this review is very uncertain about the positive and negative effects of PAE in comparison with transurethral resection surgery.

  Some people with BPH are treated with medications. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. Some of the medications decrease libido and may cause dizziness, fatigue and lightheadedness.

  When screening for prostate cancer, the PSA test may detect small cancers that would never become life-threatening, but once detected will lead to treatment. This situation, called overdiagnosis, puts men at risk for complications from unnecessary treatment such as surgery or radiation. Follow up procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer (prostate biopsy) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause incontinence (inability to control urine flow) and erectile dysfunction (erections inadequate for intercourse). As a result, in 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based screening for prostate cancer finding, "there is a very small potential benefit and significant potential harms"

  androgen deprivation therapy, and it should be used if a very quick reduction in testosterone levels is needed. However in recent years, orchiectomy is not commonly used since medical castration is a viable option. Medical castration means that drugs or medications are used to suppress the production of androgens such as testosterone. Some examples of medications used in medical castration include, euprolide, goserelin (Zoladex), buserelin, and triptorelin (Trelstar). Some of the side effects of these medications include but are not limited to "Reduced sexual desire and libido, Impotence, reduced size of testes and penis, hot flashes, growth of breast tissue (gynaecomastia) and pain across the breasts, thinning of the bones or osteoporosis and risk of fracture, anemia, loss of muscle mass, weight gain, fatigue and memory problems, and depression."

Medications that can cause problems include anticholinergics, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, decongestants, cyclobenzaprine, diazepam, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), amphetamines, and opioids. Diagnosis is typically based on measuring the amount of urine in the bladder after urinating. Treatment is typically with a catheter either through the urethra or lower abdomen. Other treatments may include medication to decrease the size of the prostate, urethral dilation, a urethral stent, or surgery. Males are more often affected than females. In males over the age of 40 about 6 per 1,000 are affected a year. Among males over 80 this increases 30%.

  As PAE is a relatively new procedure, more data is needed to determine the incidence of adverse events. The majority of adverse events during PAE are likely due to non-target embolization, and are generally self-limited in nature. The Cochrane review from 2020 assessed the current evidence and found that there are great uncertainties whether PAE differs in terms of serious side effects or problems with erections compared with transurethral resection of the prostate. However, PAE may reduce problems with ejaculation. The most common adverse effects include acute urinary retention, rectal bleeding, pain, blood in the urine/sperm, and urinary tract infection. Serious complications are uncommon, and include arterial dissection, bladder wall ischemia, and persistent urinary tract infection. Moreover, a post-embolization syndrome, consisting of pain, mild fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting and night sweats, is commonly observed after the procedure, and is treated with NSAIDS and other forms of analgesia. One single-center prospective study reported an overall complication rate up to 20.6%, with mostly minor complications including hematospermia, diarrhea, and urethral trauma from foley insertion, with one major complication of UTI requiring intravenous antibiotics.

  Prostate cancer, if non-metastatic, is commonly treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Less often, orchiectomy is used to treat prostate cancer. Prostate cancer grows in the presence of testosterone. When testosterone is present, " it is metabolized and converted into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which stimulates the growth of prostate cells. This leads to normal prostate growth in adolescents but contributes to abnormal cell growth in older men." Reducing the amount of testosterone in a person is one way in which prostate cancer is treated. If the prostate cancer is in fact metastatic, then orchiectomy may be used "...to abolish the stimulation of cancer cells by inhibiting testicular testosterone production and thereby reducing androgen levels in the blood: so-called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)." Castration or orchiectomy is a suitable option

  In acute urinary retention, urinary catheterization, placement of a prostatic stent, or suprapubic cystostomy relieves the retention. In the longer term, treatment depends on the cause. BPH may respond to alpha blocker and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy, or surgically with prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Use of alpha-blockers can provide relief of urinary retention following de-catheterization for both men and women. In case, if catheter can't be negotiated, suprapubic puncture can be done with lumbar puncture needle.

  Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. It may accelerate pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before starting therapy, and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy. Ethnic groups have different rates of prostate cancer. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer.

 1 -0.03783  Men with an enlarged prostate may suffer from symptoms of lower urinary tract obstruction, such as sensation of incomplete urination, inability to urinate, weak urinary stream, or having to urinate frequently (often awakening from sleep). If the symptoms cause a significant disruption to quality of life, a man may undergo initial treatment by oral medication, such as alpha-1 receptor blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, or phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitors. Those with severe/progressive symptoms or those who do not experience symptom relief from medication have traditionally been considered for surgical intervention, with transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP as the standard of care. However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Prostatic artery embolization is an emerging treatment alternative which avoids the risks of systemic medication and of surgery. The first report of selective prostatic artery embolization resulting in relief of prostate gland obstruction was published in 2000. Since then, prospective trials with small numbers of patients, up to approximately 200 patients/trial, have been carried out internationally.
 2 -0.08654  Some people with BPH are treated with medications. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. Some of the medications decrease libido and may cause dizziness, fatigue and lightheadedness.
 3 -0.28778  A 2020 Cochrane review of studies involving men over 40 with enlarged prostates and lower urinary tract symptoms found that prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) may work similarly to common surgical options (transurethral resection of the prostate) to relieve symptoms and improve men's quality of life in the short term (up to a year). This review found that PAE may increase the need for retreatment. In the longer term (13–24 months), this review is very uncertain about the positive and negative effects of PAE in comparison with transurethral resection surgery.
 4 -0.30159  As PAE is a relatively new procedure, more data is needed to determine the incidence of adverse events.

 5 -0.71581  When screening for prostate cancer, the PSA test may detect small cancers that would never become life-threatening, but once detected will lead to treatment. This situation, called overdiagnosis, puts men at risk for complications from unnecessary treatment such as surgery or radiation. Follow up procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer (prostate biopsy) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause incontinence (inability to control urine flow) and erectile dysfunction (erections inadequate for intercourse). As a result, in 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based screening for prostate cancer finding, "there is a very small potential benefit and significant potential harms"

['\nA new study published in the journal Current Biology suggests that the twice-yearly shift to daylight saving time may be linked to an increased risk of heart attack.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder analyzed data from 2002 to 2010 and found that the day after the springtime shift to daylight saving time, there was a 24% increase in heart attacks.\n\nThe study also found that the risk of heart attack was highest for people over 65 years old and for those with pre-existing heart conditions.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the disruption to sleep patterns caused by the time change may be to blame.\n\n"The body\'s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, is strongly linked to our sleep-wake cycle," said study author Kenneth Wright, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Colorado Boulder. "When we shift our clocks, we\'re essentially asking our bodies to go to bed and wake up at a different time than they\'re used to."\n\nThe study\'s findings are particularly concerning given that heart attacks are already a leading cause of death in the United States.\n\n"This study highlights the importance of being aware of the potential health risks associated with daylight saving time," said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist and spokesperson for the American Heart Association.

Multiple studies show a dose-response relationship between sedentary time and all-cause mortality with an increase of 3% mortality per additional sedentary hour each day. High quantities of sedentary time without breaks is correlated to higher risk of chronic disease, obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer.

  The circadian rhythm provides a person with a signal for when to sleep and when to wake up. If circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle are misaligned, this might lead to negative affect and emotional instability. It has been found that emotions vary depending on the circadian rhythm and the duration of how long one was awake. Circadian sleep-rhythm disorders like shift-work disorder or Jetlag-disorder have been found to similarly contribute to the Dysregulation of affect, with symptoms like irritability, anxiety, apathy and dysphoria.

  In March 2015 the company completed a Phase I trial for its Ebola vaccine candidate, as well as a phase II study in adults for its RSV vaccine, which would become ResVax. The ResVax trial was encouraging as it showed significant efficacy against RSV infection, using a nanoparticle-based treatment using a recombinant F lipoprotein or saponin, "extracted from the Quillaja saponaria [or?] Molina bark together with cholesterol and phospholipid." It is aimed at stimulating resistance to respiratory syncytial virus infection, targeting both adult and infant populations. 2016 saw the company's first phase III trial, the 12,000 adult Resolve trial, for its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, which would come to be known as ResVax, fail in September. This triggered an eighty-five percent dive in the company's stock price. Phase II adult trial results also released in 2016 showed a stimulation of antigenicity, but failure in efficacy.

  Selinexor sold under the brand name Xpovio among others, is a selective inhibitor of nuclear export used as an anti-cancer medication. It works by blocking the action of exportin 1 and thus blocking the transport of several proteins involved in cancer-cell growth from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, which ultimately arrests the cell cycle and leads to apoptosis. It is the first drug with this mechanism of action. The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, tiredness, thrombocytopenia (low blood-platelet counts), anaemia (low red-blood cell counts), low levels of white blood cells and hyponatraemia (low blood sodium levels). Selinexor was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2019, for use in combination with the

  Democratic U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke lost his Senate bid to the incumbent Republican Ted Cruz by about 200,000 votes, a significant gain for Democrats in the state. O'Rourke's performance in the 2018 Senate race has shaken the notion of Republican dominance in Texas, with analysts predicting greater gains for the Democrats going into the 2020s. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Texas Democrats have prioritized advocating Medicaid expansion in the state, a policy that would provide a federally subsidized healthcare plan to approximately one million Texans. Another priority for Texas Democrats in the 2010s and 2020s has been increasing the minimum wage.

He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by "deny[ing] the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city." He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.

  On November 6, 2018, El Paso County elected a new member of the House of Representatives of the United States, a new county judge, two county commissioners, five state representatives, four city council members. The national, state and county elections are partisan, and the city council election is non-partisan (there is no primary election for the city, but if no candidate wins a majority there will be a run-off election). The city and county officials elected will serve four year terms, and the state representatives and Congressperson will serve two year terms.

Redistricting by the Texas Legislature in 2003 split Austin, which had been entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, into three districts. Through Republican gerrymandering, Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the Houston suburbs. Most of his former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to McAllen on the Mexican border. It was called "the fajita strip" or "the bacon strip" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the

  while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wanted to "stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care", and also touted his strong support for higher education programs and public education. By contrast, Romo's campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth. Doggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote. He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented. The district is so heavily Democratic that he was heavily favored to win the general election

Much of his old base was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin. Doggett's home was approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had gerrymandered the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.

['A new study has found that a cannabis derivative called cannabidiol (CBD) can significantly reduce seizures in children with a severe form of epilepsy.\nThe study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, followed 120 children and young adults with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy that typically begins in infancy and is resistant to treatment.\nThe children were given either a placebo or CBD, which is derived from the cannabis plant but does not produce a high.\nThe results showed that the children who received CBD had a 39 percent reduction in seizures, compared to a 14 percent reduction in the placebo group.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Orrin Devinsky, director of the NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, said the findings were "very promising."\n"This is the first time we\'ve had a study that shows a significant reduction in seizures in children with Dravet syndrome," he said.\nThe study\'s results have led to the FDA approving a CBD-based drug called Epidiolex for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and another severe form of epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\nThe drug is expected to be available to patients in the US by the end of the year.\nThe study\'s findings have also led to renewed interest in', 'Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder']

  Vigabatrin was found by Feucht et al. to be an effective add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a serious side effect (dyskinesia). Zonisamide showed promise in an overview of controlled and uncontrolled trials conducted in Japan. However, in a physician survey conducted December 2004, only 28% of Lennox–Gastaut and West syndrome patients improved on zonisamide. One yet to be published study from 2017 supported the use of cannabidiol.

  Female cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), thought to be the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis; and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis. It takes over one hour for Marinol to reach full systemic effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, "It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine." Clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone and HU-308.

  Cannabidiol (CBD) is a Phyto-cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant. This compound is connected to improving anxiety, cognition, and pain. Although it is orphan, GPR3 is phylogenetically most closely related to the cannabinoid receptors. Using β-arrestin2 recruitment and cAMP accumulation assays, it was recently found that cannabidiol is an inverse agonist for GPR3. The affects that the inverse agonist has are still unknown.

["In October 2019, a group of global health leaders, business executives, and government officials gathered at a luxury hotel in New York City to simulate a scenario: A novel coronavirus was spreading through the human population, and the world needed to be ready.\n\nThe event, called Event 201, was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, a research and education center that aims to prevent and control epidemics and pandemics. The center is part of Johns Hopkins University, which is one of the world's leading research institutions.\n\nThe scenario was designed to test the world's readiness for a pandemic, and to identify ways to improve the global response to such an event. The participants included representatives from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among others.\n\nThe simulation was based on a hypothetical outbreak of a novel coronavirus, which is a type of virus that has never been seen before in humans. The virus was modeled after the SARS virus, which caused an outbreak in 2003 that killed more than 700 people.\n\nDuring the simulation, the participants discussed the challenges of responding to a pandemic, including the need for clear communication, the importance of international cooperation, and the need for a coordinated global response.\n\nThe simulation", 'Event 201 “gave out stuffed souvenir coronavirus toys” to “commemorate” Novel coronavirus outbreak']

  New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in

  On December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. The unknown pneumonia was a novel coronavirus, which they later named COVID-19. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak. By the time the WHO realized

  The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and a pandemic on March 11. Hundreds of millions of people contracted the disease, a percentage of whom died from it. As a result, travel restrictions, social distancing measures, and many other precautions have been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while many vaccines are undergoing phased distribution in most countries. As with many medical topics, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic emerged and were spread both by private citizens and politicians. The misinformation focuses on

  have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak. With the improved public

  system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment. However, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people

  on the outbreak on 5 January 2020. Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University completed sequencing of the novel virus on the same day, and published the results to the online database GenBank on 11 January. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: "Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China." On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted.

Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission. The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.

  On 29 January, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a notice, urging the scientists "to write their papers on the land of the motherland, to use the results to fight the epidemic" and the scientists should not focus on publishing their papers until the epidemic prevention and control task is completed. Duowei News believed this was aimed to respond to the academic conflict between Zhang Yongzhen's group from Fudan University which published the first genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV and the Gao Shan group from Nankai University which published an analysis on the sequence without authorization from Zhang.

['In a recent interview with CNSNews.com, John O\'Bannon, the president of the anti-abortion group Pro-Life Nation, said that "some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit."\nO\'Bannon made his comments in response to a question about the recent undercover videos released by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) that show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal organs and tissues.\n"Planned Parenthood has been caught red-handed in the sale of baby body parts," O\'Bannon said. "The videos released by the Center for Medical Progress show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal organs and tissues. This is a clear violation of federal law, and it is time for the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Planned Parenthood for these crimes."\nO\'Bannon also criticized the media for not covering the story more extensively.\n"The mainstream media has been largely silent on this issue," he said. "They have been more interested in covering the story of a missing Malaysian Airlines flight than they have been in covering the story of Planned Parenthood\'s sale of baby body parts. This is a clear indication of the media\'s bias and their willingness to protect Planned Parenthood at all costs', 'John O\'Bannon Says "some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit.']

  O'Reilly supported California Proposition 73 because it would have required parental notification of underage girls seeking an abortion. "[T]he left-wing media has been able to convince millions of Americans that the government knows what's best for families, not the parents." O'Reilly strongly condemns doctors who provide legal abortion services. Since 2005, he has repeatedly referred to physician and abortion doctor George Tiller as "Tiller the baby killer" on his Fox News prime time show, claiming that there must be "a special place in hell" for him. In May 2009, Tiller was murdered by anti-abortion radical Christian terrorist Scott Roeder. O'Reilly ardently condemns the practice of partial birth abortion. He has criticized the practice being done without explanations being made and has criticized human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for not condemning the practice: "Once again, this isn't about a women's [sic] right to choose or the New York Times plea for reproductive rights. This is about late term abortions for just about any reason."

  Ojeda self-identifies as pro-life but also stated he supports abortion rights and that he would only nominate judges who likewise shared his support for abortion. In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, "I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life." He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, "a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist’s child". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as "pro-life, with exceptions". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”

In his column in the Jesuit magazine America, Professor John F. Kavanaugh, S.J., observed: "Most people open to the facts recognize that a human life has begun by the end of the first trimester of a pregnancy. It is at this point that some common ground may be reached to protect unborn human life. There is political will at hand to ensure such protection; but as long as the extreme positions hold sway, no action will be taken."

  Gardner has said that he is pro-life and that abortion laws should be left up to the states. In 2006, Gardner opposed legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception and proposed an amendment to the Colorado state budget to prohibit the state Medicaid plan from purchasing Plan B emergency contraception. In 2007, he voted against a bill requiring hospitals to inform survivors of a sexual assault of the availability of emergency contraception. In 2012, Gardner co-sponsored the controversial so-called "personhood" legislation titled the Life Begins at Conception Act. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. According to The Denver Post, "Gardner conceded that with

In November 2015, Posner authored a decision in Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Schimel striking down regulations on abortion clinics in Wisconsin. He rejected the state's argument that the laws were written to protect the health of women and not to make abortion more difficult to obtain. Accusing the state of indirectly trying to ban abortions in the state Posner wrote, "They [Wisconsin] may do this in the name of protecting the health of women who have abortions, yet as in this case the specific measures they support may do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion."

  In November 2007, O'Malley said that the Democratic Party has been persistently hostile to pro-life groups and that the fact many Catholic voters support Democratic candidates "borders on scandal." In a November 2008 interview he said that, unless the Church formally excommunicated them, he would not deny Communion to Catholic politicians in his diocese who support legal abortion. Despite criticism from conservative Catholics, including Raymond Arroyo of Eternal Word Television Network, of his participation in the funeral service for Senator Ted Kennedy, a long-standing supporter of legal abortion, O'Malley assisted at the funeral Mass and led a prayer. He called for less contentious political dialog: "We will not change hearts by turning away from people in their time of need and when they are experiencing grief and loss." He said he appreciated the Senator's work for social justice, but that "there is a tragic sense of lost opportunity in his lack of support for the unborn".

In 1930 Pope Pius XI ruled out what he called "the direct murder of the innocent" as a means of saving the mother. And the Second Vatican Council declared: "Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes."

The unsuccessful results of these clinical trials prompted CancerVax to say it would cut payroll by more than half to roughly 80 employees from 183. Immediately following this announcement, CancerVax's stock plunged $1.30, or 44.5%, to $1.62 and well below its 52-week low of $2.70. In less than 30 minutes after the opening bell, nearly 850,000 CancerVax shares had been traded, or more than 17 times the average daily trade for the previous three months.

Which classification scheme (receptor IHC or DNA expression profile) more reliably assorts particular cancers to effective therapies is under investigation. Several commercially marketed DNA microarray tests analyze clusters of genes and may help decide which possible treatment is most effective for a particular cancer.

  The conclusion of the Human Genome Project was followed with hope for a new paradigm in treating disease. Many fatal and intractable diseases were able to be mapped to specific genes, providing a starting point to better understand the roles of their protein products in illness. Drug discovery has made use of animal knock-out models that highlight the impact of a protein' s absence, particularly in the development of disease, and medicinal chemists have leveraged computational chemistry to generate high affinity compounds against disease-causing proteins. Yet FDA drug approval rates have been on the decline over the last decade. One potential source of drug failure is the disconnect

Selpercatinib was approved based on the results of the LIBRETTO-001 clinical trial (NCT03157128) involving 702 participants aged 15–92 years with each of the three types of tumors. During the clinical trial, participants received 160 mg selpercatinib orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR), which reflects the percentage of participants that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage, and duration of response (DOR).

 Although not totally silent because they are still being played by striking a stick on the surface of the drum heads, electronic drums and their counterpart devices usually produce considerably less acoustic noise than a traditional drum kit. Also, the drummer can use headphones for an essentially silent and private practice in dwellings where it would be impossible to have a studio or acoustic noise level, and perhaps where regular-sized kits would not fit. ; They are much lighter, smaller, and easier to transport than an acoustic drum kit.

   In music and music theory, the beat is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level (or beat level). The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician counts while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect (often the first multiple level). In popular use, beat can refer to a variety of related concepts, including pulse, tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove. Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed and unstressed beats (often called "strong" and "weak") and divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications.

['Three scientists won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for their work in developing new methods to harness the power of antibodies, which are used to fight cancer and other diseases.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that the award went to Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology, George Smith of the University of Missouri and Gregory Winter of the University of Cambridge.\nArnold, 62, was cited for "the directed evolution of enzymes," which involves modifying the properties of enzymes, the biological molecules that drive most chemical reactions in the body.\nSmith, 77, was honored for "the methodology for directed evolution," which involves creating large libraries of enzymes and screening them for desired properties.\nWinter, 70, was recognized for "phage display of peptides and antibodies," which involves using viruses to create large libraries of antibodies and screening them for desired properties.\nTheir work has led to the development of antibody drugs, which are now the most successful class of pharmaceuticals, and to the creation of enzymes that can perform useful chemical reactions.\nTheir methods have also led to the creation of "smart enzymes" that can be programmed to perform specific tasks, such as breaking down plastics or cleaning up oil spills.\nThe award comes with a cash prize of 9 million', 'Trio wins chemistry Nobel for work on antibody drugs, smart enzymes.']

In 1939 Gerhard Domagk, a German, was not allowed by his government to accept the prize. He later received a medal and diploma, but not the money. As of 2021, the prize has been awarded to 224 individuals, twelve of them were women: Gerty Cori (1947), Rosalyn Yalow (1977), Barbara McClintock (1983), Rita Levi-Montalcini (1986), Gertrude B.

  Because of this, the prize can be awarded in a broader range of fields. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, von Behring received 150,782 SEK, which was equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2008. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

  The 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi for the discovery of HIV. They shared the Prize with Harald zur Hausen, who discovered that human papilloma viruses can cause cervical cancer. Montagnier said he was "surprised" that Robert Gallo was not also recognized by the Nobel Committee: "It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that. I'm very sorry for Robert Gallo." According to Maria Masucci, a member of the Nobel Assembly, "there was no doubt as to who made the fundamental discoveries." Montagnier is the co-founder of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention and co-directs the Program for International Viral Collaboration. He

  the Academy reconsidered the award in September 1945. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry had now become more cautious, as it was apparent that much research had been undertaken by the Manhattan Project in the United States in secret, and it suggested deferring the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for another year. The Academy was swayed by Göran Liljestrand, who argued that it was important for the Academy to assert its independence from the Allies of World War II, and award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to a German, as it had done after World War I when it had awarded it to Fritz Haber. Hahn therefore became the sole recipient of the 1944 Nobel Prize in

  The 2012 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Serge Haroche and David Wineland for their work on controlling quantum systems. Haroche was born 1944 in Casablanca, Morocco, and in 1971 gained a PhD from Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. He shares half of the prize for developing a new field called cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) – whereby the properties of an atom are controlled by placing it in an optical or microwave cavity. Haroche focused on microwave experiments and turned the technique on its head – using CQED to control the properties of individual photons. In a series of ground-breaking experiments, Haroche used CQED to realize Schrödinger's famous cat experiment in which a system is in a superposition of two very different quantum states until a measurement is made on the system. Such states are extremely fragile, and the techniques developed to create and measure CQED states are now being applied to the development of quantum computers.

Instead, students will be able to provide documentation from a mental health professional, which will be kept confidential by the University's Office of Disability Services.\nThe changes are part of a broader effort by the University to improve mental health services for students.

  On the same day that PLOS One announced its review, Brown University took down a press release it had earlier posted about the paper. Responding to critics, Brown University President Christina Paxson and Provost Richard Locke said they had not infringed on academic freedom and stated that Brown's commitment to only "publicize research that unassailably meets the highest standards of excellence" required Brown to retract the press release after PLOS One opened an investigation on the paper in question. They said that "given the concerns raised about research design and methods, the most responsible course of action was to stop publicizing the work published in this particular instance. We would have done this regardless of the topic of the article."

  The reactions to Brown's removal of the press release from its website included criticism by Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School. Flier wrote that the controversy surrounding Professor Littman's paper raised serious concerns of all academics to conduct research on controversial topics. "The fact that Brown University deleted its initial promotional reference to Dr. Littman’s work from the university’s website—then replaced it with a note explaining how Dr Littman’s work might harm members of the transgender community—presents a cautionary tale. Increasingly, research on politically charged topics is subject to indiscriminate attack on social media, which in turn can pressure school administrators to subvert established norms regarding the protection of

  as a whole often harbor negative attitudes toward those with mental illnesses. Historically, people with mental illnesses have been portrayed as violent or criminal and because of this, "many American jails have become housing for persons with severe mental illnesses arrested for various crimes." In 1999 the Supreme Court ruled on the case Olmstead v. L.C. The Court ruled that it was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to keep an individual in a more restrictive inpatient setting, such as a hospital, when a more appropriate and less restrictive community service was available to the individual.

  the turn of the millennium. Disability was once viewed as resulting from a moral lapse, such as poor actions of parents, resulting in having a child with disabilities. Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. More recently institutions are beginning to view disability as a limitation of the social and physical environments and not a limitation of the individual. For example, stairs are a limitation for individuals who have mobility issues, but ramps are accessible to individuals with and without a mobility limitation. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result

Anderson went on to promise that students will also have "confidential and seamless access" to psychological counselling services, paid for by the department. Harvard students currently have unlimited access to mental health services if seen by a psychologist or psychiatrist at University health services and up to 40 sessions of regular outside care with a copay as part of their continuing effort to provide access to mental health care. The molecule whose synthesis Altom was attempting to complete, aspidophytine, was subsequently completed by postdoctoral research associates and published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in 1999.

The other students that were interviewed for this study came to the consensus that they "recalled feelings of alienation, dread, and disembodiment." They also recalled that during gym class, oftentimes they felt "humiliated, vulnerable, or incompetent." Studies have been done on programs such as Texas Fitness Now that have revealed that physical education as it exists in the United States has caused a rise in disciplinary issues in children and absences from school. This study comes to the conclusion that physical programs allow for the harassment of children who do not measure up to the physical fitness standards, and that is why so many students skip their P.E classes.

  homosexuality is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and is not a mental disorder. The APA's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation affirms the tension between some religious values and other organizations, as well as the existence of a subset of individuals who are distressed about their same-sex attractions. Nevertheless, it says it has not found adequately rigorous studies that suggest sexual orientation change efforts are successful. The APA Task Force has also found that some individuals reported being harmed by change efforts. The consensus of the world's major mental health organizations is that homosexuality is not a mental disorder.

Carmel reviewed the medical literature for articles with recidivism (vs. terms like rehospitalization) in the title and found that articles in the psychiatric literature were more likely to use the term recidivism with its criminological connotation than articles in the rest of medicine, which avoided the term. Carmel suggested that "as a means of decreasing stigmatization of psychiatric patients, we should avoid the word 'recidivism' when what we mean is 'rehospitalization'". A 2016 followup by Peirson argued that "public policy makers and leaders should be careful to not misuse the word and unwittingly stigmatize persons with mental illness and substance use disorders".

  Psychological Science released a statement calling for the elimination of the concept of ROGD from clinical and diagnostic use, as "there are no sound empirical studies of ROGD and it has not been subjected to rigorous peer-review processes that are standard for clinical science." The statement also states that the term "ROGD" is likely to stigmatize and cause harm to transgender people, and that misinformation surrounding ROGD is used to justify laws suppressing the rights of transgender youth. The statement was cosigned by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the Society of Behavioral Medicine, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies and the National Association of School Psychologists.

Historically, people with mental illnesses have been portrayed as violent or criminal and because of this, "many American jails have become housing for persons with severe mental illnesses arrested for various crimes." In 1999 the Supreme Court ruled on the case Olmstead v. L.C. The Court ruled that it was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to keep an individual in a more restrictive inpatient setting, such as a hospital, when a more appropriate and less restrictive community service was available to the individual.

Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. More recently institutions are beginning to view disability as a limitation of the social and physical environments and not a limitation of the individual. For example, stairs are a limitation for individuals who have mobility issues, but ramps are accessible to individuals with and without a mobility limitation. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result

Harvard students currently have unlimited access to mental health services if seen by a psychologist or psychiatrist at University health services and up to 40 sessions of regular outside care with a copay as part of their continuing effort to provide access to mental health care.

Carmel reviewed the medical literature for articles with recidivism (vs. terms like rehospitalization) in the title and found that articles in the psychiatric literature were more likely to use the term recidivism with its criminological connotation than articles in the rest of medicine, which avoided the term. Carmel suggested that "as a means of decreasing stigmatization of psychiatric patients, we should avoid the word 'recidivism' when what we mean is 'rehospitalization'". A 2016 followup by Peirson argued that "public policy makers and leaders should be careful to not misuse the word and unwittingly stigmatize persons with mental illness and substance use disorders".

['A new study has found that doctors can detect a baby\'s illness by scanning the mother\'s blood.\nThe research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, shows that a simple blood test can reveal whether a baby has a serious infection or other health problem.\nThe study, led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, involved 100 pregnant women and their babies.\nThe women were given a blood test at 35 weeks of pregnancy, and again at birth.\nThe researchers found that the blood test could accurately predict which babies would develop serious health problems, such as sepsis or respiratory distress syndrome.\nThe test works by detecting changes in the levels of certain proteins in the mother\'s blood.\nThese proteins are produced by the body in response to infection or other health problems in the baby.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Alexander Y. Tsai, said the test could be a valuable tool for doctors.\n"This test has the potential to be a non-invasive way to monitor the health of the fetus and detect problems early on," he said.\nThe researchers say the test could be particularly useful for women who are at high risk of having a baby with health problems, such as those with a history of preterm labor or those carrying twins.\nThe study\'s senior author, Dr. Mark L. Roberts, said the test could also', "Baby illness can be scanned in mother's blood: study."]

  The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. For example, two O blood type parents can produce a child only with an O blood type, and two parents with a B blood type can produce a child with either a B or an O blood type. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent

  Obstetric ultrasonography, or prenatal ultrasound, is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or fetus in the uterus (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy,

['A new drug for refractory psoriatic arthritis has shown promise in a clinical trial, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nThe drug, called Tofacitinib, is an oral medication that inhibits the activity of Janus kinases, which are enzymes that play a role in the immune system.\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, involved 387 patients with active psoriatic arthritis who had not responded to other treatments.\nThe patients were randomly assigned to receive either Tofacitinib or a placebo, along with methotrexate, a standard treatment for psoriatic arthritis.\nAfter 12 weeks, the patients who received Tofacitinib showed significant improvements in joint function, as measured by the American College of Rheumatology criteria.\nThe drug also led to significant reductions in joint swelling and tenderness, as well as improvements in skin symptoms, such as redness and scaling.\nThe most common side effects of Tofacitinib were upper respiratory tract infections and headaches.\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. John Davis, said that the results were "very encouraging" and that Tofacitinib could provide a new treatment option for patients with refractory psori', 'Drug for refractory psoriatic arthritis shows promise in clinical trial']

  Tofacitinib is a current investigational drug in psoriasis. It has demonstrated its effectiveness for plaque psoriasis in phase III, randomized, controlled trials in comparison to placebo and to etanercept. In particular, a ten-mg, twice-daily dose of tofacitinib was shown to be not inferior to etanercept 50 mg, subcutaneously, twice weekly. Approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of psoriasis was rejected by the FDA due to safety concerns.

  The potential significance of JAK3 inhibition was first discovered in the laboratory of John O'Shea, an immunologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 1994, Pfizer was approached by the NIH to form a public-private partnership to evaluate and bring to market experimental compounds based on this research. Pfizer initially declined the partnership, but agreed in 1996, after the elimination of an NIH policy dictating that the market price of a product resulting from such a partnership would need to be commensurate with the investment of public taxpayer

  and the "health and safety needs of the public." Pfizer worked with O'Shea's laboratory to define the structure and function of JAK3 and its receptors, and then handled the drug discovery, preclinical development, and clinical development of tofacitinib in-house. The drug was coded as CP-690,550 during development. Its original recommended INN (rINN) was tasocitinib, but that was overruled during the INN approval process as being not optimally differentiable from other existing INNs, so the name "tofacitinib" was proposed and became the INN. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Two rheumatologists interviewed by the magazine

  Biotechnology complained that they were "shocked" and "disappointed" at the $2,055 a month wholesale price. A 2014 study showed that tofacitinib treatment was able to convert white fat tissues into more metabolically active brown fat, suggesting it may have potential applications in the treatment of obesity. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib "to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate. The FDA approved only the five-mg, twice-daily dose on the grounds that a higher dose was not considered to have an adequate risk-to-benefit ratio.

  Currently, much attention is focused on developing Janus kinase inhibitors as drugs for immune diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, and psoriases. The first JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was tofacitinib. It has also shown promising results in other autoimmune disorders. Initially, tofacitinib was thought to be a selective JAK3 inhibitor, but later was found to be a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2. The value of developing a selective JAK3 targeting over the other JAKs is that JAK3 expression is restricted to the immune system, while the other JAKs are much more broadly expressed. Since JAK3 is not as ubiquitously expressed, selective targeting could improve tolerability, and decrease possible adverse effects and safety concerns. For example, dual inhibition

  Tofacitinib, sold under the brand Xeljanz among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Common side effects include diarrhea, headache, and high blood pressure. Serious side effects may include infections, cancer, and pulmonary embolism. In 2019, the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency began a review of tofacitinib and recommended that doctors temporarily not prescribe the 10 mg twice-daily dose to people at high risk for pulmonary embolism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also released warnings about the risk of blood clots. An important side effect of Jakinibs is serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. In the phase 3 trials of tofacitinib among opportunistic infections, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 3 cases all of which were initially negative upon screening for TB. It is in the janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor class, discovered and developed by the National Institutes of Health and Pfizer. Tofacitinib is a small molecule, not a biologic. As of June 2021, tofacitinib is available as a generic medicine in the US.

Inhibition of JAK3 has in research shown to be a good target for immunosuppression. The only indication for a JAK3 inhibitor at the moment, rheumatoid arthritis, is for the nonselective JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor tofacitinib. Other indications, such as psoriasis, alopecia areata, and ulcerative colitis are in clinical trials. Cytokines have an important role in autoimmune diseases and as the common γ chain cytokines interleukin IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 signal via JAK3, the inhibition of JAK3 and blocking of the signaling of these cytokines could affect many immune diseases and lead to development of new effective immunosuppressive drugs.

  Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. An outbreak of cholera subsequently ensued with 517 confirmed cases in the Beira area between 24 and 31 March. The number of confirmed cases exceeded 1,500 by 3 April. By 10 April, 4,072 confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities. The crowded and poor neighborhoods of the city were at greatest risk for continued spread of

  V. cholerae has an endemic or epidemic occurrence. In countries where the disease has been for the past three years and the cases confirmed are local (within the confines of the country) transmission is considered to be "endemic." Alternatively, an outbreak is declared when the occurrence of disease exceeds the normal occurrence for any given time or location. Epidemics can last several days or over a span of years. Additionally, countries that have an occurrence of an epidemic can also be endemic. The longest standing V. chloerae epidemic was recorded in Yemen. Yemen had two outbreaks, the first occurred between September 2016 and April 2017, and the second began later in April 2017 and recently was considered to be resolved in 2019. The epidemic in Yemen took over 2,500 lives and impacted over 1 million people of Yemen More outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Americas, and Haiti.

This campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin A supplementation. A yellow fever outbreak, the worst in the country in three decades began in December 2015. By August 2016, when the outbreak began to subside, nearly 4,000 people were suspected of being infected. As many as 369 may have died. The outbreak began in the capital, Luanda, and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces.

  Médecins Sans Frontières reported at least 200 presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. An increase in the incidence of malaria was noted, attributed to malarial mosquitoes breeding in the stagnant water. Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700 cases of diarrhoea by 26 March. The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks

On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. The agency's vaccination campaign began in earnest on 3 April. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region.

  dehydration, and vomiting Dehydration poses the biggest health risk to pregnant women in countries that there are high rates of cholera. In cases of cholera gravis involving severe dehydration, up to 60% of patients can die; however, less than 1% of cases treated with rehydration therapy are fatal. The disease typically lasts 4–6 days. Worldwide, diarrhoeal disease, caused by cholera and many other pathogens, is the second-leading cause of death for children under the age of 5 and at least 120,000 deaths are estimated to be caused by cholera each year. In 2002, the WHO deemed that the case fatality ratio for cholera was about 3.95%.

In the former nation, rescuers were forced to let some people die in order to save others. A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10 April.

In countries where the disease has been for the past three years and the cases confirmed are local (within the confines of the country) transmission is considered to be "endemic." Alternatively, an outbreak is declared when the occurrence of disease exceeds the normal occurrence for any given time or location. Epidemics can last several days or over a span of years. Additionally, countries that have an occurrence of an epidemic can also be endemic. The longest standing V. chloerae epidemic was recorded in Yemen. Yemen had two outbreaks, the first occurred between September 2016 and April 2017, and the second began later in April 2017 and recently was considered to be resolved in 2019.

["\nInfertility affects one in eight couples, and for many, the cause is male-related. But getting a sperm count test can be a hassle. It requires a visit to a fertility clinic, where a semen sample is collected and analyzed.\n\nNow, a new at-home sperm test is available, which could make the process much easier.\n\nThe test, called Yo Sperm, is the first at-home male-infertility test to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's available for purchase online, and costs $39.\n\nThe test, which is made by a company called Osome, works by detecting the presence of sperm in a semen sample. It does not measure the number of sperm, or their motility (their ability to swim).\n\nTo use the test, a man collects a semen sample in a cup, and then adds a small amount of testing solution to it. The solution contains a dye that changes color when it comes into contact with sperm.\n\nThe man then waits for 10 minutes, and looks for a color change in the sample. If the color changes, it indicates that sperm are present.\n\nThe test is not intended to replace a full semen analysis, which is still required for a definitive diagnosis of infertility. But it can be a", 'I’ll Take a Sperm Test, to Go: First at-Home Male-Infertility Test Debuts']

  Sperm washing is the process in which individual sperms are separated from the semen. Washed sperm is used in artificial insemination using the intrauterine insemination (IUI) technique and in in vitro fertilization (IVF). It may also be used to decrease the risk of HIV transmission by an HIV-positive male, in which case the washed sperm is injected into a female using an artificial insemination technique. Sperm washing involves removing any mucus and non-motile sperm in the semen to improve the chances of fertilization and to extract certain disease-carrying material in the semen. Sperm washing is a standard procedure in infertility treatment. Once the fastest sperm have been isolated, before using them for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, it is important to confirm the absence of HIV virus in the sample. The sample obtained after washing is analysed, usually using the PCR technique, to check that there is no viral particle. If the result is negative, i.e. there is no virus, this sample is suitable for use in assisted reproduction treatments. These samples are usually free of the virus in a high percentage.

  concoctions claimed to be spermicidal. His instructions were to soak wool in one of the mixtures, then place near the cervix. Laboratory testing of substances to see if they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s. Modern spermicides nonoxynol-9 and menfegol were developed from this line of research. However, many other substances of dubious contraceptive value were also promoted. Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 Comstock Act, spermicides—the most popular of which was Lysol—were marketed only as "feminine hygiene" products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness. Worse, many manufacturers recommended using the products as a douche after intercourse, too late to affect all the sperm. Medical estimates during the

  In the United States, paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are readily available for purchase, though their results are not admissible in court and are for personal knowledge only. Only a court-ordered paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings. If parental testing is being submitted for legal purposes, including immigration, testing must be ordered through a lab that has AABB accreditation for relationship DNA testing. The legal implications of a parentage result test vary by state and according to whether the putative parents are unmarried or married. If a parentage test does not meet forensic standards for the state in question, a court-ordered test

  Sperm washing takes place in a laboratory following sperm donation. Sperm may be washed by density gradient centrifugation or by a "direct swim-up" technique that does not involve centrifugation. In normal semen samples, centrifugation causes no more DNA damage to spermatozoa than a direct swim-up technique. Washed sperm is concentrated in Hams F10 media without L-glutamine, warmed to 37 °C. A chemical known as a cryoprotectant is added to the sperm to aid the freezing and thawing process. Further chemicals may be added which separate the most active sperm in the sample, as well as extend or dilute the sample so that vials for a number of inseminations are produced.

  Testosterone therapy (TTh), which aims to restore testosterone levels to mid-normal ranges in men diagnosed with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), is an approved treatment. Treatment for oligospermia is centered around underlying causes, such as endocrine and systematic disorders that can cause hypogonadism. Typically, other assisted reproductive technologies are used. Although there is no FDA indication for use of aromatase inhibitors improving spermatogenesis, testolactone has been shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Though there is no FDA indication for the use of clomiphene in male infertility, it has been prescribed since the 1960s. As of 2013, there is not substantial evidence to suggest that clomiphene can treat male infertility. Combinations of vitamins and minerals, including selenium, co-enzyme Q10, L-carnitine, folic acid, zinc, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to improve male infertility, but due to

  low amounts of studies and participants, more clinical studies are needed. Folate in combination with zinc supplementation was shown to have a statistically significant effect on sperm concentration and morphology when compared to placebo. There is evidence suggesting a significant association between vitamin D serum concentrations and the quality of sperm in men, characterized by the sperm's motility and progress motility. Because the quality of men's sperm is influenced by genetics, results should be interpreted cautiously. There is little evidence that supplementation with antioxidants, such as pentoxifylline will increase male fertility. As of September 2017, mesenchymal stem cell therapy for infertility has been studied in animals, but has not entered clinical trials. Stem cells collected from bone marrow and umbilical cord have shown the most ability to rehabilitate fertility in animals, but more studies are needed to determine efficacy.

Mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, without any shuffling. Proving a relationship based on comparison of the mitochondrial genome is much easier than that based on the nuclear genome. However, testing the mitochondrial genome can prove only if two individuals are related by common descent through maternal lines only from a common ancestor and is, thus, of limited value (i.e., it could not be used to test for paternity). In testing the paternity of a male child, comparison of the Y chromosome can be used, since it is passed directly from father to son. In the US,

  DNA paternity testing is the use of DNA profiles to determine whether an individual is the biological parent of another individual. Paternity testing can be especially important when the rights and duties of the father are in issue and a child's paternity is in doubt. Tests can also determine the likelihood of someone being a biological grandparent. Though genetic testing is the most reliable standard, older methods also exist, including ABO blood group typing, analysis of various other proteins and enzymes, or using human leukocyte antigen antigens. The current techniques for paternity testing are using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Paternity testing can now also be performed while the

  The presence of anti-sperm antibodies in infertile men was first reported in 1954 by Rumke and Wilson. It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility. Anti sperm antigen has been described as three immunoglobulin isotopes (IgG, IgA, IgM) each of which targets different part of the spermatozoa. If more than 10% of the sperm are bound to anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), then infertility is suspected. The blood-testis barrier separates the immune system and the developing spermatozoa. The tight junction between the Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier but it is usually breached by physiological leakage. Not all sperms are protected by the barrier because spermatogonia and early spermatocytes are located below the junction. They are protected by other means like immunologic tolerance and immunomodulation. Infertility after anti-sperm antibody binding can be caused by autoagglutination, sperm cytotoxicity, blockage of sperm-ovum interaction, and inadequate motility. Each presents itself depending on the binding site of ASA.

["A new study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease has identified a biomarker for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that could potentially lead to a diagnosis while the patient is still alive.\nCTE is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is caused by repeated head trauma, and is commonly found in athletes who have played contact sports such as football, hockey, and boxing.\nThe study, which was led by Dr. Lee Goldstein, a professor of neurology and pathology at Boston University School of Medicine, and Dr. Thor Stein, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, analyzed the brains of 202 deceased individuals, including 176 athletes and 26 non-athletes.\nThe researchers found that the presence of a specific protein, called neurogranin, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of living individuals could be used to predict the presence of CTE in the brain.\nThe study also found that the levels of neurogranin in the CSF were significantly higher in individuals with CTE than in those without the disease.\nThe findings of the study suggest that neurogranin could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool for CTE, which could lead to earlier intervention and treatment for individuals who are at risk for the disease.\nHowever, the study also notes", 'Researchers identify CTE biomarker that may lead to diagnosis while alive']

  In 1992, a gene called apolipoprotein E was established as a possible factor in Alzheimer's disease, but its presence did not predict disease with certainty. Existence of amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain is a common finding in Alzheimer's pathology. Results from the nuns indicated that neurofibrillary tangles located in regions of the brain outside the neocortex and hippocampus may have less of an effect than plaques located within those areas. Another potential factor was brain weight, as subjects with brains weighing under 1000 grams were seen as higher risk than those in a higher weight class.

It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis.

  Increased CCL11 levels in blood plasma are associated with aging in mice and humans. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that exposing young mice to CCL11 or the blood plasma of older mice decreases their neurogenesis and cognitive performance on behavioural tasks thought to be dependent on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Higher plasma concentrations of CCL11 have been found in current cannabis users compared to past users and those who had never used. CCL11 has also been found in higher concentrations in people suffering from schizophrenia; cannabis is a known trigger of schizophrenia. It's also a biomarker for CTE or punch-drunk syndrome. During periods of bone inflammation, CCL11 and CCR3 are upregulated. This is associated with an increase in osteoclast activity.

   While diagnostic criteria are not expected to change in the near future, work to develop biomarkers that help with diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is ongoing. New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti-myelin antibodies, and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but none of them has yielded reliably positive results. At the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis. Several promising approaches have been proposed including: interleukin-6, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, osteopontin, and fetuin-A. Since disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as neurofilaments, tau, and N-acetylaspartate are under investigation.

In a 1999 study, Gur et al. found a link between the amount of white matter in a person's brain and their performance on spatial tasks. Fine points out that the sample size of ten people is a small sample size, and the researchers tested for thirty-six different relationships in this sample. Fine argues that results like these should be treated with caution, because, given the sample size and the number of relationships tested, the correlation found between white matter volume and performance in the tasks could be a false positive. Fine accuses the researchers of downplaying the risk of a false positive after conducting many statistical analyses of past research projects, she

  The conclusion of the Human Genome Project was followed with hope for a new paradigm in treating disease. Many fatal and intractable diseases were able to be mapped to specific genes, providing a starting point to better understand the roles of their protein products in illness. Drug discovery has made use of animal knock-out models that highlight the impact of a protein' s absence, particularly in the development of disease, and medicinal chemists have leveraged computational chemistry to generate high affinity compounds against disease-causing proteins. Yet FDA drug approval rates have been on the decline over the last decade. One potential source of drug failure is the disconnect

Annual checkups are used to track the impact of genetic markers, brain images, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors on cognitive changes in the women. The data has shown a link between a human leukocyte antigen and brain health with the HLA-DRB1*13:02 allele correlating with less brain damage and with cognitive health over time. This observation provides a molecular mechanism to explain the widely published observation that infections by certain pathogens, such as herpes virus, contribute to loss of brain function and increased incidence of Alzheimer Disease.

The most commonly used imaging technique is computed tomography (CT), which uses x-rays and a computer to create a sophisticated picture of the brain's tissues and structures. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. An increasingly common tool is magnetic resonance imaging, which uses a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves, instead of radiation, to create a picture of the brain. ; Enzyme assay: A recent development in diagnosis of NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing lysosomal

Results from the nuns indicated that neurofibrillary tangles located in regions of the brain outside the neocortex and hippocampus may have less of an effect than plaques located within those areas.

   Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke. The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat, and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and

  Over time, atheromata usually progress in size and thickness and induce the surrounding muscular central region (the media) of the artery to stretch out, termed remodeling, typically just enough to compensate for their size such that the calibre of the artery opening (lumen) remains unchanged until typically over 50% of the artery wall cross-sectional area consists of atheromatous tissue. If the muscular wall enlargement eventually fails to keep up with the enlargement of the atheroma volume, or a clot forms and organizes over the plaque, then the lumen of the artery becomes narrowed as a result of repeated ruptures, clots & fibrosis over the tissues separating the atheroma from the blood

Multi-linear regression analysis revealed that an increased Framingham cardiovascular score was associated with CIMT, and carotid plaque independent of geographic differences. Cahn et al. prospectively followed-up 152 patients with coronary artery disease for 6–11 months by carotid artery ultrasonography and noted 22 vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and coronary angioplasty) within this time period. They concluded that carotid atherosclerosis measured by this non-interventional method has prognostic significance in coronary artery patients.

Forty-eight subjects were randomly assigned to a control group and a treatment group; those in the treatment group were put on a 25% calorie reduction over a 6-month period. It was found that the treatment group had lower insulin resistance, lower levels of LDL cholesterol, lower body temperature and blood-insulin levels as well as less oxidative damage to their DNA. The second, larger, phase of CALERIE began in 2007. The participants are subjected to a 25% calorie restriction over a 2-year period, and several physiological variables are regularly monitored.

['California lawmakers want to repeal HIV criminalization laws.\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers want to repeal laws that make it a crime for people with HIV to have sex without disclosing their infection.\n\nThe Senate Public Safety Committee voted unanimously Thursday to repeal the laws. The bill now goes to the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe laws were enacted in 1988, when little was known about HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe bill\'s author, Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, says the laws are outdated and discourage people from getting tested.\n\nThe bill would replace the criminal penalties with a misdemeanor for exposing someone to HIV through "willful misconduct."\n\nThe bill is supported by the California District Attorneys Association.\n\nThe laws have been used to prosecute people for spitting, biting and scratching.\n\nThe bill is SB 159.\n\n"""', 'California lawmakers want to repeal HIV criminalization laws.']

  of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights released a report on the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure in Canada with four recommendations for the House of Commons and the Canadian Government. The committee recommended that a new law be created specifically for the transmission of HIV, instead of relying on pre-existing laws such as sexual assault. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and "HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual’s partner is on PrEP or (4)

  In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In court, prosecutors presented 11,000 text messages and 36 audio clips to support their case against Guerra. Since then, Guerra has been accused of intentionally exposing dozens of other men to HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or "negligent" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. From a global perspective, the U.S. and Canada account for the vast majority of reported prosecutions.

  type of sexual act (such as oral sex) is one where there is a negligible risk of transmission." This allows for four different scenarios in which HIV positive people will not have to disclose their status because of the nature of the sexual encounter; current laws only allow for one specific scenario with multiple requirements. HIV researchers have criticized the recommendations for not going far enough to counteract the adverse effects that the current law imposes on women. Although people living with HIV are generally aware of non-disclosure laws, many do not fully understand the law or understand when they do or do not have to disclose their status.

  In July 2010 the White House announced a major change in its HIV/AIDS policy, a change informed by public health law research carried out by Scott Burris, professor of law at Temple University and the director of its Public Health Law Research program. The Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States concluded that "the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment." In the fall of 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the 'Positive Justice Project',

Courts have looked into the statistical probability of HIV transmission to overturn or reduce criminal sentences resulting from prosecutions. For example, on 23 February 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reversed the aggravated assault conviction of Technical Sergeant David Gutierrez upon determining, that the risk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse was not "likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm" under the applicable statute. As of 2017, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that those who have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood cannot transmit the virus.

The action was opposed by the U.S. Public Health Service.

  Proposition 36, also titled A Change in the "Three Strikes Law" Initiative, was a California ballot measure that was passed in November 2012 to modify California's Three Strikes Law (passed in 1994). The latter law punishes habitual offenders by establishing sentence escalation for crimes that were classified as "strikes", and requires a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 to life for a "third-strike offense." Proposition 36 adjusted the law so that, in order to be classified as a third strike, the offense must be a "serious or violent felony". This serious or violent clause does not apply to defendants previously convicted of rape, murder or child molestation. Additionally, the initiative added a

 3 -1.31277  In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In court, prosecutors presented 11,000 text messages and 36 audio clips to support their case against Guerra. Since then, Guerra has been accused of intentionally exposing dozens of other men to HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or "negligent" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. From a global perspective, the U.S. and Canada account for the vast majority of reported prosecutions.
 4 -2.02041  The measure would repeal Section 31 of Article I of the California Constitution. The following text would be repealed: 1. The State shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. 2. This section shall apply only to action taken after the section's effective date. 3. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as prohibiting bona fide qualifications based on sex which are reasonably necessary to the normal operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. 4. Nothing 
 5 -3.28526  In July 2010 the White House announced a major change in its HIV/AIDS policy, a change informed by public health law research carried out by Scott Burris, professor of law at Temple University and the director of its Public Health Law Research program. The Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States concluded that "the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment." In the fall of 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the 'Positive Justice Project',

['A new study published in the journal Addiction has found that nicotine replacement treatments (NRTs) may not be effective in helping smokers quit for the long-term. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, followed 8,270 smokers for 12 months after they had quit smoking. The researchers found that while NRTs were effective in helping smokers quit in the short-term, their effectiveness declined over time.\n\nThe study found that smokers who used NRTs for 12 weeks were more likely to quit smoking than those who did not use NRTs. However, after 12 months, there was no significant difference in smoking cessation rates between those who used NRTs and those who did not.\n\nThe researchers also found that smokers who used NRTs for longer periods of time were more likely to experience side effects, such as nausea and headaches. These side effects were more common in smokers who used NRTs for more than 12 weeks.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Jamie Brown, said that the findings suggest that NRTs may not be the best option for long-term smoking cessation. "Our results suggest that NRTs may not be the best option for long-term smoking cessation," said Brown. "While', 'Nicotine Replacement Treatments May Not Work Long-Term']

Another study by Brandon, Herzog, Juliano, Irvin, Lazev, & Simmons continued the work of the previous two by using a longitudinal perspective. After testing for persistence using the APT and the MTPT, the participants went through eleven days of smoking cessation therapy that included cognitive-behavioral therapy, training on coping strategies, and nicotine replacement therapy.

  Research has shown NRT in combination with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can improve the rates of smoking cessation in pregnant women. CBT counseling includes motivational interviewing, Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, and Social Cognitive Theory. Nicotine patches are under study to help relieve the symptoms of postoperative pain and to treat early dementia. Studies are being conducted about the use of transdermal nicotine patches to treat anxiety, depression, and inattentiveness in subjects with ADHD and to treat late-life depression. Two small studies have shown that transdermal nicotine patches improve some symptoms of ulcerative colitis. However, this is not the case with Crohn's disease, a similar health condition, where smoking and nicotine intake in general worsen the disease's effects.

  basis for 6 months and then at 9 and 12 months for updates on their smoking habits. In addition to supporting previous findings that smokers perform worse on persistence tasks, participants who scored higher on the persistence tasks were less likely to relapse during the 12-month period of the study. Although the study was again limited because of its correlational design, the authors suggest that their results fit within the theoretical framework of learned industriousness. An additional study by Steinberg et al. looking at adolescents and smoking found much of the same results as Brandon et al. Non-smoking adolescents scored higher on a self-reported persistence measure than smokers and smokers who planned on quitting scored higher than those who did not plan on quitting.

In Sweden, use of snus, as an alternative to smoking, has risen steadily since that nation's smoking ban. Smoking restrictions may make it easier for smokers to quit. A survey suggests 22% of UK smokers may have considered quitting in response to that nation's smoking ban. Restaurant smoking restrictions may help to stop young people from becoming habitual smokers. A study of Massachusetts youths, found that those in towns with smoking bans were 35 percent less likely to be habitual smokers.

  The study concluded that 96.5% of men with bronchogenic carcinoma were heavy to chain smokers, compared to 73.7% of the general population. Statistically, it was rare to find cases of epidermoid or undifferentiated carcinoma in males who haven’t been heavy smokers. Moreover, 96.1% of people with lung cancer smoked for over 20 years, which leads the researchers to hypothesize a 10-year or more lag time between starting smoking and exhibiting the first signs of cancer. Since the overwhelming majority of smokers smoked cigarettes and more cigarette users inhale, this was thought to be a factor in developing lung cancer at a higher rate. Most importantly, the study proved a dose-dependent relationship. Subjects who developed lung cancer smoked more excessively and for a more prolonged period of time than individuals who did not develop the disease.

  and 52-week follow-ups. The authors concluded benzodiazepines were not effective in the long term for sleep problems except in suppressing withdrawal-related rebound insomnia. Improvements were seen between 24 and 52 weeks after withdrawal in many factors, including improved sleep and several cognitive and performance abilities. Some cognitive abilities, which are sensitive to benzodiazepines, as well as age, such as episodic memory, did not improve. The authors, however, cited a study in younger patients who at a 3.5-year follow-up showed no memory impairments and speculated that certain memory functions take longer to recover from chronic benzodiazepine use and further improvements in elderly people's cognitive function may occur beyond 52 weeks after withdrawal. The reason it took 24 weeks for improvements to be seen

  polling for inhalation, they discovered cigarette smoke is inhaled more often than that of cigars or pipes. Also, women smoke a lot less than men, and there was not enough data to link smoking to lung cancer in these cases. Therefore, Wynder conducted separate study on women in 1956.  (Note: graph above was reproduced from Figure 3: "Percentages for amount of smoking among 605 male patients with cancer of the lungs and 780 men in the general hospital population without cancer with the same age and economic distribution" of Wynder and Graham's study) (Note: table above was reproduced from Table 5: "Age Distribution in 605 Cases of Cancer of the Lung in Men" of Wynder and Graham's study)

"We cannot continue to allow this kind of blatant bigotry to go unchecked."\n\nThe article also quotes a spokesperson for the restaurant chain, who defended the name, saying that it has nothing to do with race and that it\'s simply a reference to the company\'s history.\n\n"We\'re proud of our name and our history," said the spokesperson. "We\'ve been serving our customers for over 50 years, and we\'re not going to change who we are just because some people don\'t understand our history."\n\nBut the liberals are not backing', 'Liberals" want to change the name of Cracker Barrel to "Caucasian Barrel" because otherwise it\'s racist.']

  The slogan "White Pride Worldwide" appears on the logo of Stormfront, a website owned and operated by Don Black, who was formerly a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The North Georgia White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan describe themselves as "a patriotic, White Christian revival movement dedicated to preserving the maintenance of White Pride and the rights of the White Race". A 2002 study identified white pride as a motivation for racial hate crimes on a US college campus, while in a different study on internet racism, the slogan was identified as being part of an emerging transnationalist trend in white supremacist movements. The slogan was also documented to have been used in hate speech incidents at New York University, Vassar College, Temple University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Tennessee, and it was a slogan used in posters put

Certain Denver Nuggets jerseys were named "white pride" by Adidas and were listed as such on the team's website in 2016, after which internet outcry prompted the team to rename the jerseys. Similarly, a fitness room in River Falls, Wisconsin was renamed to avoid the racist connotations of it being referred to as the "White Pride Fitness Room". The slogan was chanted along with "White Power" by up to 100 neo-Nazis rallying in Manchester, United Kingdom in March 2015 and was the theme of a March 2016 event in Swansea and a March 2017 event in Edinburgh, all of which were organized by the National Front. In an exposé from The Week, James Poulos warned that "Europe is on track to rediscover what looks to us like a highly unsettling form of white pride."

  In July 2015, Wolverhampton-born historian and anti-racism campaigner Patrick Vernon OBE called for the design of the flag to be replaced, saying that "the Black Country factories and foundries made chains, shackles and manacles during slavery that were used in colonial Africa to enslave black people. The same factories employed people from the Caribbean and Asia during the 1950s and 60s on lower wages and poorer working conditions compared to their white counterparts. And of course the chain industry oppressed the white working classes too, so I feel the use of the chain logo is inappropriate in today's world where we know the effects of this history".

The same factories employed people from the Caribbean and Asia during the 1950s and 60s on lower wages and poorer working conditions compared to their white counterparts. And of course the chain industry oppressed the white working classes too, so I feel the use of the chain logo is inappropriate in today's world where we know the effects of this history".

['A new study published in the journal Science has found that a specific gene is linked to homosexuality in men. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Queensland in Australia, analyzed the DNA of more than 400,000 men and found that a variation in the CDH13 gene was associated with same-sex attraction.\n\nThe study, which is the largest of its kind, also found that the gene is not linked to homosexuality in women. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the fact that the gene is located on the X chromosome, which is only passed down from mothers to sons.\n\nThe study\'s lead author, Dr. Andrew Beck, said that the findings could help to explain why homosexuality is more common in men than in women. "Our results suggest that there is a genetic component to male homosexuality, and that this component is located on the X chromosome," he said.\n\nHowever, the study\'s authors caution that the findings do not prove that homosexuality is genetic. "While our results are significant, they do not prove that homosexuality is genetic," said Dr. Beck. "More research is needed to fully understand the role of genetics in sexual orientation."\n\nThe study\'s findings have been met with mixed reactions. Some experts have praised the study for its size and rigor, while others have criticized', "There's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic."]

They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them". Their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population". However, in the same study, the authors noted that "nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing "social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way" (and thus seek out a greater number

  which causes sickle-cell anemia when two copies are present, also confers resistance to malaria with a lesser form of anemia when one copy is present (this is called heterozygous advantage). Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality. In a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in

  Sexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be maladaptive in an evolutionary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection—on the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency. Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility. Some scholars have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage in a non-obvious way on heterosexual siblings or their children, a hypothesised instance of kin selection. By way of analogy, the allele (a particular version of a

  of the multiple causes of homosexuality. In 2017, Scientific Reports published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named SLITRK6 on chromosome 13 was identified. The research supports another study which had been done by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay. LeVay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. The SLITRK6 is active in the mid-brain where the hypothalamus is. The researchers found that the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) on chromosome 14 shows sequence differences between gay and straight

  found to have similar alleles in the distal region of Xq28, which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the "gay gene" in the media, causing significant controversy. Sanders et al. in 1998 reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side. A later analysis by Hu et al. replicated and refined the earlier findings. This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X

  also found that the genetic effects that differentiate heterosexual from homosexual behavior are not the same as those that differ among nonheterosexuals with lower versus higher proportions of same-sex partners, which suggests that there is no single continuum from heterosexual to homosexual preference, as suggested by the Kinsey scale. In October 2021, another research paper reported that genetic factors influence the development of same-sex sexual behavior. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a total sample of 1478 homosexual males and 3313 heterosexual males in Han Chinese populations identified two genetic loci (FMR1NB and ZNF536) showing consistent association with male sexual orientation.

  Graves' disease is associated with TSHR abnormalities, with previous research indicating that Graves' disease is more common in gay men than in straight men. Research indicated that gay people have lower body weight than straight people. It had been suggested that the overactive TSHR hormone lowered body weight in gay people, though this remains unproven. In 2018, Ganna et al. performed another genome-wide association study on sexual orientation of men and women with data from 26,890 people who had at least one same-sex partner and 450,939 controls. The data in the study was meta-analyzed and obtained from the UK Biobank study and

In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology bred a female mice specifically lacking a particular gene related to sexual behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice. In interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism.

  the regions detected in the Hamer lab's previous genomewide study. The authors concluded that "our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation". Female sexual orientation does not seem to be linked to Xq28, though it does appear moderately heritable. In addition to sex chromosomal contribution, a potential autosomal genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the

  Chromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993, Dean Hamer and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families. Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested

In October 2021, another research paper reported that genetic factors influence the development of same-sex sexual behavior. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a total sample of 1478 homosexual males and 3313 heterosexual males in Han Chinese populations identified two genetic loci (FMR1NB and ZNF536) showing consistent association with male sexual orientation.

They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them". Their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population". However, in the same study, the authors noted that "nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing "social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way" (and thus seek out a greater number

The authors concluded that "our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation". Female sexual orientation does not seem to be linked to Xq28, though it does appear moderately heritable. In addition to sex chromosomal contribution, a potential autosomal genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested.

The research supports another study which had been done by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay. LeVay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men.

  14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. Five years after seeking abortion services, women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trimester abortions. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical

The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly

  the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion. The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the US during 2000; this accounts for <0.2% of the total number of abortions performed that year. Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 and 19 weeks, and 2% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&E, and 30% were medical. There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China, India and Vietnam than in developed countries.

  within gestational limits, while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical, mental, or socioeconomic criteria. While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. Complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortalities worldwide, though this varies by region. Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women. The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon.

 Abortion rate – number of abortions annually per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age (some sources use a range of 15–49) ; Abortion percentage – number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages) There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion: In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable. For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error. The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003

  risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy; from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more (as measured from the last menstrual period). It appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation (whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage) correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies. The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been

  Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. 91% of these were classified as having been done by "curettage" (suction-aspiration, dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation), 8% by "medical" means (mifepristone), >1% by "intrauterine instillation" (saline or prostaglandin), and 1% by "other" (including hysterotomy and hysterectomy).

  per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that "Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term." Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that "26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion," whereas "deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally." In Indonesia in 2000 it was estimated that 2 million pregnancies ended in abortion, 4.5 million pregnancies were carried to term,

  whose statistics were deemed incomplete. An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three-quarters of those using the birth control pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that "most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women" because minority women "have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR).

  "access to legal, safe and comprehensive abortion care, including post-abortion care, is essential for the attainment of the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health". Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. , 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it.

The procedure involves removing a portion of the temporal lobe, which is the part of the brain that is most commonly affected by epilepsy.\nThe results of the study were striking. The children who underwent the surgery experienced an average of 90 percent reduction in seizures, compared to just 10 percent for those who did not undergo the surgery.\nThe study also found that the children who underwent the surgery were more likely to be able to attend school and participate in extracurricular activities, and that they had improved cognitive function.\nThe researchers noted that the surgery is not without risks, and that it should only be considered for children who have tried other treatments without success. However, they said that the results of the study suggest that the surgery should be considered as a viable option for children with severe epilepsy.\nThe study is the first to test the effectiveness of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children, and the results are expected to have a significant impact on the treatment of epile', 'First test of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children shows dramatic benefit']

Since 2010, this assumption has been challenged. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. There are several procedures that have shown efficacy:

  hospital including at least one night in an intensive care unit. Although such treatment can be costly, multiple studies have demonstrated that ATL in patients who have failed at least two anticonvulsant drug trials (thereby meeting the criteria for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) has lower mortality, lower morbidity and lower long-term cost in comparison with continued medical therapy without surgical intervention. The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. Therefore, ATL is considered the standard of care for patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

  The techniques for removing temporal lobe tissue vary from resection of large amounts of tissue, including lateral temporal cortex along with medial structures, to more restricted anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) to more restricted removal of only the medial structures (selective amygdalohippocampectomy, SAH). Nearly all reports of seizure outcome following these procedures indicate that the best outcome group includes patients with MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis (hippocampal atrophy with increased T-2 signal.) The range of seizure-free outcomes for these patients is reported to be between 80 and 90%, which is typically reported as a sub-set of data within a larger surgical series. Open surgical procedures such as ATL have inherent risks including damage to the brain (either directly or indirectly by injury to important blood vessels), bleeding (which can require re-operation), blood loss (which can require transfusion), and infection. Furthermore, open procedures require several days of care in

  Vigabatrin was found by Feucht et al. to be an effective add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a serious side effect (dyskinesia). Zonisamide showed promise in an overview of controlled and uncontrolled trials conducted in Japan. However, in a physician survey conducted December 2004, only 28% of Lennox–Gastaut and West syndrome patients improved on zonisamide. One yet to be published study from 2017 supported the use of cannabidiol. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20 mg/kg a day compared to placebo.

  0.026% of all children in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area were estimated to have LGS in 1997, which was defined as, "onset of multiple seizure types before age 11 years, with at least one seizure type resulting in falls, and an EEG demonstrating slow spike-wave complexes (<2.5 Hz)." The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies.

  The diagnosis of LGS should be suspected in children less than 8 years old with seizures of multiple types that cannot be treated with antiseizure medications. Because of high risk of irreversible brain damage in early stages of syndrome (particularly in infants and young children), early diagnosis is essential. It may take 1–2 years after first initial seizure for all criteria for diagnosis to emerge, so LGS should be considered if there are suggestive signs and symptoms without presence of complete triad. To confirm diagnosis, awake and asleep EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed. MRI is used to detect focal brain lesions.

  The test is usually performed prior to ablative surgery for epilepsy and sometimes prior to tumor resection. The aim is to determine which side of the brain is responsible for certain vital cognitive functions, namely speech and memory. The risk of post-operative cognitive change can be estimated, and depending on the surgical approach employed at the epilepsy surgery center, the need for awake craniotomies can be determined as well. The Wada test has several side-effects. Drastic personality changes are rarely noted, but disinhibition is common. Also, contralateral hemiplegia, hemineglect and shivering are often seen.

  Acetone has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects in animal models of epilepsy, in the absence of toxicity, when administered in millimolar concentrations. It has been hypothesized that the high-fat low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet used clinically to control drug-resistant epilepsy in children works by elevating acetone in the brain. Because of their higher energy requirements, children have higher acetone production than most adults – and the younger the child, the higher the expected production. This indicates that children are not uniquely susceptible to acetone exposure. External exposures are small compared to the exposures associated with the ketogenic diet.

(1993) found increased electrophysiological abnormalities in sexually abused children. Some studies indicate that sexual or physical abuse in children can lead to the overexcitation of an undeveloped limbic system. Teicher et al. (1993) used the "Limbic System Checklist-33" to measure ictal temporal lobe epilepsy-like symptoms in 253 adults. Reports of child sexual abuse were associated with a 49% increase to LSCL-33 scores, 11% higher than the associated increase of self-reported physical abuse. Reports of both physical and

Transient amnesia can be the principal manifestation of epilepsy. This diagnosis, however, is "seldom suspected by clinicians and remains controversial". TEA is "almost always misdiagnosed" according to a leading authority. In the largest study to date (2007) "Epilepsy was the initial specialist diagnosis in only 12 of 50 cases."

['The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, has been linked to autism in some studies. However, the majority of scientific research has found no connection between the vaccine and autism.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the MMR vaccine began in 1998 when a study published in The Lancet claimed to have found a link between the vaccine and autism. The study was later retracted and the author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was found to have committed serious scientific misconduct.\n\nDespite the retraction, the myth that the MMR vaccine causes autism persists. In 2015, a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that parents who believed the vaccine caused autism were less likely to have their children vaccinated.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is considered safe and effective by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The CDC recommends that children receive their first dose of the vaccine at 12-15 months of age and a second dose at 4-6 years of age.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is not without risks, however. According to the CDC, the most common side effect is a mild fever. More serious side effects, such as seizures, are rare. Death is listed as a side effect, but this is extremely rare and typically only', 'Death is listed as a side effect of the MMR vaccine.']

  prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine "overload", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

  In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that vaccination prevents 2.5 million deaths each year. With 100% immunization, and 100% efficacy of the vaccines, one out of seven deaths among young children could be prevented, mostly in developing countries, making this an important global health issue. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus. The Immunization Surveillance, Assessment and Monitoring program of the WHO monitors and assesses the safety and effectiveness of programs and vaccines at reducing illness and deaths from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines. Vaccine-preventable deaths are usually caused by a failure to obtain the vaccine in a timely manner. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine.

  He rejected the idea that a diagnosis of autism at or around 18 months, the same time the vaccinations were administered, was coincidental. When the California Department of Health Services, along with studies from England and Finland, reported that the vaccine "plays little or no role in the disease," Rimland stated that it was "much too early to dismiss the [vaccine] hypothesis". He remained undeterred when a study by Robert L. Davis, published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found no association between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease, discussed in the Wakefield report, "nor any evidence that the vaccine triggered acute onset of symptoms."

  2004, 10 of the 13 co-authors of the Wakefield study withdrew the original interpretation. The United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2004 report found that, "the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism." The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), National Health Service (NHS), World Health Organization (WHO), European Medicines Agency (EMEA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and many other national and international medical organizations have issued statements of a similar nature, finding no link between autism and thimerosal based on the evidence currently available from a variety of studies.

  Rimland considered vaccinations to be a "prime suspect" in the onset of autism. He maintained that, while not proven, there was a direct link between thiomersal (a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines) and autism. He supported Andrew Wakefield's now discredited suggestion that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. Rimland contended that the vaccination triggered autism by placing a burden on the immune systems of children between birth and age 2. Rimland linked the increase of late-onset autism during the 1980s with the introduction of the MMR vaccine, a correlation the Center for Disease Control, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Medical Association did not

Similarly, the American Janssen vaccine that was approved on February 27, 2021 for use was also paused by the CDC due to a blood-clotting issue. By April 13, 2021, there were reports that within two weeks of receiving the vaccine, six women developed rare blood clots in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) accompanied with low blood platelets levels (thrombocytopenia) in which one case was fatal. By that time, there were more than 6.8 million people who had already received the vaccine. During

"We all know and accept that mercury is a neurotoxin, and yet the FDA has failed to recall the 50 vaccines that contain Thimerosal", Burton wrote, adding "Every day that mercury-containing vaccines remain on the market is another day HHS is putting 8,000 children at risk." The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not agree that vaccines containing mercury caused autism, and the US FDA refused to ban the vaccines. Most manufacturers removed the preservatives from their vaccines anyway, with no resulting decrease in autism rates.

The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. The agency's vaccination campaign began in earnest on 3 April. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable.

  Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. An outbreak of cholera subsequently ensued with 517 confirmed cases in the Beira area between 24 and 31 March. The number of confirmed cases exceeded 1,500 by 3 April. By 10 April, 4,072 confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities. The crowded and poor neighborhoods of the city were at greatest risk for continued spread of

  Médecins Sans Frontières reported at least 200 presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. An increase in the incidence of malaria was noted, attributed to malarial mosquitoes breeding in the stagnant water. Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700 cases of diarrhoea by 26 March. The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks

In the former nation, rescuers were forced to let some people die in order to save others. A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10 April. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be at least $2.2 billion (2019 USD), with US$1 billion alone in infrastructure damages, making Idai the costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean basin.

A total of 128,941 people were displaced to 143 evacuation centers nationwide, often in extremely poor conditions. Three-fourths of the displaced persons reside in Sofala Province where the cyclone made its second landfall. It was reported on 23 March that many local emergency centers in Mozambique had only recently been supplied with food, and some areas remained cut off.

It aims to increase the ability for the government to monitor health risks and the immunization process, as well as better the relationship between the Haitian government and international organizations within the health sector. This is an active project with the project end date being December 31, 2024. Currently the results of this project are: 45.3% of children aged 12 to 23 months in project intervention areas are fully vaccinated, 45% of suspected cases of cholera are given notifications within 10 days, 72% and 77% of suspected cases of diphtheria and measles, respectively, were investigated and reported within 48 hours.

After affecting the central Mozambique provinces, Funso brushed the coastline of the Inhambane Province in the south with rains and winds of 70 km/h (40 mph). At least 70,000 people were without a clean drinking water supply following the storm, and more than 56,000 were left homeless

Unprecedented flooding ensued along the banks of the Buzi River. President Filipe Nyusi stated "whole villages [disappeared]" along the Buzi and Pungwe banks. On 17 March, rivers in the western provinces of Mozambique were hit with floodwaters from rising rivers. The city of Búzi continued to flood as of 20 March, placing its 200,000 residents at high-risk. On 19 March, a 50 km section of the Buzi remained flooded. Thousands of people remained trapped on rooftops four days after Idai made landfall. Floodwaters estimated to be 6 m submerged entire communities.

Initial forecasts suggested that the cyclone would impact South Africa or make landfall in southern Mozambique, but this became less likely as the storm continued tracking south. Nevertheless, some local tourists voluntarily evacuated the coastal city of Inhambane in Mozambique in anticipation of the storm. In Malawi, a country adjacent to Mozambique, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall, causing two rivers near Nsanje to exceed their banks and flood nearby villages.

This campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin A supplementation. A yellow fever outbreak, the worst in the country in three decades began in December 2015. By August 2016, when the outbreak began to subside, nearly 4,000 people were suspected of being infected. As many as 369 may have died. The outbreak began in the capital, Luanda, and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces.

['The United States government has been grappling with how to respond to the novel coronavirus strain, which has infected thousands of people and killed dozens in China. As the situation has escalated, the government has been working to negotiate a response, but cost issues have temporarily stalled passing a bill approving roughly $8 billion in emergency funding.\n\nThe bill, which was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, would provide funding for research, development, and distribution of vaccines and treatments, as well as for medical supplies and equipment. The funding would also support efforts to contain the virus in China and prevent its spread to other countries.\n\nHowever, the bill has faced opposition from some lawmakers who are concerned about the cost and the lack of a clear plan for how the funds will be used. Some have called for more oversight and accountability measures to be included in the bill.\n\nDespite these concerns, the bill has received bipartisan support and is expected to pass both the House and Senate in the coming days. The funding is seen as critical to addressing the growing threat of the virus and preventing a global pandemic.\n\nThe United States is not alone in its efforts to address the outbreak. Other countries, including China, Japan, and South Korea, have also taken steps to contain the virus and provide support to those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency and', 'As the United States government tried to negotiate a response to a novel coronavirus strain, cost issues temporarily stalled passing a bill approving roughly $8 billion in emergency funding.']
