There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans.

Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as \"tyranny\" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it. This was decided based on the statistics showing that there were only 19 fatal cases out of more than 25 million people who had already received it worldwide.

Also, when focusing on the excessive smokers subset, there is a 32.1% difference in excessive smokers in the lung cancer group and general hospital group.

This was achieved in 2010 when mature cardiac \n\n A systematic review found 23 articles, published since 2010, as well as nine relevant clinical trials related to congenital heart disease and recent advances in stem cell therapies. Pre-clinical research has focused on several types of stem cells including: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), autologous umbilical cord blood cells, c-kit+ cardiac stem cells, and neonatal thymus mesenchymal stem cells. These cell types have shown the ability to differentiate into cardiac tissue making them ideal for cardiac regenerative therapy. The purpose of these studies was to determine if stem cells safely taken from an individual’s bone marrow could be transplanted back into the injured heart muscle of the individual and improve the heart’s ability to pump following a heart attack, as well as to determine the best time for transplanting the cells following a heart attack.

Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense (\"buoyant\") LDL. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of \n\n Blood tests commonly report LDL-C: the amount of cholesterol which is estimated to be contained with LDL particles, on average, using a formula, the Friedewald equation. In clinical context, mathematically calculated estimates of LDL-C are commonly used as an estimate of how much low density lipoproteins are driving progression of atherosclerosis. The problem with this approach is that LDL-C values are commonly discordant with both direct measurements of LDL particles and actual rates of atherosclerosis progression. Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a couple of laboratories in the United States.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

There is a belief that ocean noise presents a significant threat to marine mammals and other marine species. The head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare's whale programme, Patrick Ramage said collisions with ships, water pollution and seismic activity from oil drilling can kill or disorient whales.

The failure rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair has been shown to dramatically increase from 4% to 67% in patients with significant bone loss. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates. Another study suggested that \"shneck pain\" was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. Shoulders are a common place for tissue injuries, especially if the person plays overhead sports such as tennis, volleyball, baseball, swimming, etc. According to Bahr's major injury related statistics, shoulder dislocations or subluxations account for 4% of injuries in adults ages 20–30 and 20% of shoulder injuries are fractures. Shoulder girdle pain can be acute or chronic and be due to a number of causes. Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain. The main long term side effect is reduced external rotation range in the shoulder. In summary, the Latarjet operation may ideally be suited as the shoulder reconstruction procedure of choice for contact athletes, patients with increased shoulder laxity, failed previous shoulder reconstructions or if there is significant bone damage.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years. For every suicide, there were seven non-fatal attempts. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides. Recent notable examples of young adults that commit suicide include Cpt (Dr) Allan Ooi Seng Teik, who ended his life on 3 March 2009 presumably due to disenchantment working with the Singapore Armed Forces. A 1998 study (Joyce & Fleminger) reported that according to the British Office of Population Censuses and Surveys from 1990 to 1994, 4% of all deaths by suicide were accountable by autokabalesis or from jumping in front of moving objects. The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6). Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths. Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In February 2016, the FDA issued a \"black box\" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Cerebral organoids have been used in studies in order to understand the process by which Zika virus affects the fetal brain and, in some cases, causes microcephaly. Increased apoptosis was also found in cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus. The results found from studying cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus at different stages of maturation suggest that early exposure in developing fetuses can cause greater likelihood of Zika virus-associated neurological birth defects.

In 2016, the FDA found that systemic use (by mouth or injection) of fluoroquinolones was associated with \"disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects\" involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, concluding that these side effects generally outweigh the benefits for people with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections when other treatment options are available. The FDA put out another label change in July 2017, strengthening the warnings about potentially disabling adverse effects and limiting use of these drugs to second-line treatments for acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Quinolones are associated with a small risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture; a 2013 review found the incidence of tendon injury among those taking fluoroquinolones to be between 0.08 and 0.20%. The risk appears to be higher among people older than 60 and those also taking corticosteroids; the risk also may be higher among people who are male, have a pre-existing joint or tendon issue, have kidney disease, or are highly active. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Reports of serious adverse events began emerging, and the FDA first added a black-box warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. In August 2013, the agency required updates \n\n More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate.

When opponents pointed out that this would necessitate an internal ultrasound for early-term pregnancies, an amendment was passed to limit the requirement to external ultrasounds only. In most countries, routine pregnancy sonographic scans are performed to detect developmental defects before birth. This includes checking the status of the limbs and vital organs, as well as (sometimes) specific tests for abnormalities. Some abnormalities detected by ultrasound can be addressed by medical treatment in utero or by perinatal care, though indications of other abnormalities can lead to a decision regarding abortion. The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including \"risks\" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary.

In Iran, a case report (first submitted in May) described severe MIS-C in a 5-year-old girl who had presented with shock and was initially diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, and further cases of the new syndrome have been recorded. On 2 June, news emerged of a first case of MIS-C diagnosed in Peru.

Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity. Blood tests and X-rays of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor (ANF), extractable nuclear antigen, and specific antibodies. Rheumatoid factor and ANA tests are generally negative in systemic JIA. Lab findings: anemia of chronic disease (can also appear in non-systemic types ), neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin). Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. Intranasal mometasone alleviates symptoms such as rhinorrhea aquosa, nasal congestion, nasal drip, sneezing, and pharyngeal itching. Although mometasone furoate does not have significant systemic immunomodulatory effects, it can be considered a local immunosuppressive drug because clinical studies have shown reductions (vs. baseline ) in neutrophils (a white blood cell) in the nasal mucosa. cardiac inflammation; and c) treating the underlying disorder. Afflicted individuals who fail this regimen or present with cardiogenic shock may benefit from treatment with other non-specific immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, as adjuncts to, or replacements for, corticosteroids. However, individuals with an underlying therapeutically accessible disease should be treated for this disease; in seriously symptomatic cases, such individuals may be treated concurrently with a corticosteroid regimen. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4–6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. During treatment with pyrimethamine, leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Currently, there is no published evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that corticosteroids would be an effective adjunct for treating ocular toxoplasmosis. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be equivalent to triple therapy in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis and may be better tolerated.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. After confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC. The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the region, it did not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC. Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHEIC was that the \n\n risk of international spread was deemed to be low, and the risk of damaging the economy of the DRC high. Acknowledging a high risk of spread to the capital of North Kivu, Goma, a call for a PHEIC declaration was published on 10 July 2019 in the Washington Post by Daniel Lucey and Ron Klain (the former United States Ebola response coordinator). and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus.

In the United States as of 2012, abortion was estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth. CDC estimated in 2019 that US pregnancy-related mortality was 17.2 maternal \n\n Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently \"induced miscarriage\". It is safer than childbirth, which has a 14 times higher risk of death \n\n the United States. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&E or induction abortion. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though the use of such medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve \n\n the skin.\" A 2010 review found that sham acupuncture was as effective as real acupuncture for chronic low back pain.

HHS replied that they could not find any such reports. While ICAN claimed the absence of these reports means that the federal government has neglected to properly study the effect of vaccines, scientists and the fact-checking site Politifact pointed out a large number of in-depth studies were undertaken and their results shared with the public, even though HHS failed to file the required reports. One of the most infamous examples of such abuses was the actions of South Carolina physician, Dr. Clovis Pierce. After accepting federal money to perform the sterilizations of 18 Medicaid patients in his clinic, he told women that he would only deliver their third pregnancy on the condition that they would submit to sterilization immediately afterwards. Furthermore, the South Carolina State branch of the American Medical Association (AMA) unanimously supported Pierce's actions against all of the women. and coercive because 1) neither the mother nor her daughters gave any indication of wanting to undergo surgical sterilization, 2) neither mother nor daughters met with the physician who would perform the operation before the fact, and 3) neither mother nor daughters received information about the consequences of tubal sterilization from a physician or member of the clinic staff.

Epidemiologist Hiroshi Nishiura expressed concern that the games could help spread more contagious COVID-19 variants, given the fact that a large numbers of athletes, coaches, officials, media, local volunteers, and domestic spectators would participate in the games. Japan's former environment minister Nobuteru Ishihara was swiftly admitted to hospital after he tested positive for COVID-19 without showing symptoms. New infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in \n\n Former Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has said that \"the new coronavirus is having a major impact on tourism, the economy and our society as a whole\". Prime Minister Abe has considered using emergency funds to mitigate the outbreak's impact on tourism, of which Chinese nationals account for 40%.

First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is generally spread when an infected person coughs and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the lungs, but can spread to any part of the body. Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria. The bacteria also carry the UreC gene, which prevents acidification of the phagosome. When in the lungs, M. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, but they are unable to kill and digest the bacterium. M. tuberculosis, then known as the \"tubercle bacillus\", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as \"Koch's bacillus\". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. A contaminated droplet can infect any person and they can become contaminated with M. tuberculosis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Similar bans have passed in California in the cities of Oakland and Sonoma as well \n\n  Smoking bans, or smoke-free laws, are public policies, including criminal laws and occupational safety and health regulations, that prohibit tobacco smoking in certain spaces. The spaces most commonly affected by smoking bans are indoor workplaces and buildings open to the public such as restaurants, bars, office buildings, schools, retail stores, hospitals, libraries, transport facilities, and government buildings, in addition to public transport vehicles such as aircraft, buses, watercraft, and trains. However, laws may also prohibit smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, pedestrian plazas, college and hospital campuses, and within a certain distance from the entrance to a building. The most common rationale cited for restrictions on smoking is the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoke (SHS), or the inhalation of tobacco smoke by persons who are not smoking. It shows that out of 201519 votes, nearly 82% of people were against Prop C. Which means that the citywide ban on e-cigarette products will be effective in 2020. September 4, 2019, Michigan became the first state in the nation to ban flavored e-cigarettes. The ban did not include workplaces, but covered all other indoor public spaces and its enforcement was somewhat limited. In the United States, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Since breastfeeding studies are, for ethical reasons, never conducted as randomized controlled trials, critics have repeatedly suspected that studies may have produced the superiority of breastfeeding as an artifact. Both the physical, emotional and mental development of children and the preferences of women for a feeding method are strongly determined by socioeconomical factors such as the mother's ethnicity, social class, and education. Not beginning feeding an infant by mouth for more than 4 days does not appear to have protective benefits.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery and the rate of complications may be higher, but there are not enough high-quality studies to know at the present time. Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids, abnormal periods, endometriosis, ovarian tumors, uterine prolapse, and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies. Articles in the newly created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon's experience. Complications related to robotic surgeries range from converting the surgery to open, re-operation, permanent injury, damage to viscera and nerve damage. From 2000 to 2011, out of 75 hysterectomies done with robotic surgery, 34 had permanent injury, and 49 had damage to the viscera. There is inconsistent evidence of benefits compared to standard surgery to justify the increased costs. Robotic surgery has also been utilized in radical cystectomies. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery. This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Another issue that exists with high deer density is the spreading of infectious diseases. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the country and is found in twelve states in Eastern America. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n all ticks are infected. In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease). Those wishing to know the incidence of tick-borne diseases in their town or state can search the LMZ surveillance database. The feeding time required to transmit pathogens differs for different ticks and different pathogens. Several high-profile deaths have been caused by the tick–human transmission of disease, including the death of former Senator Kay Hagan in the United States in 2019 at the age of 66.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox. Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite Hispanic and African American children under 5 years old. In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States. May 2017 saw a return of measles to the US after an outbreak in Minnesota among unvaccinated children. Another outbreak occurred in the state of New York between 2018 and 2019, causing over 200 confirmed measles cases in mostly ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in New Jersey and Washington state with over 30 cases reported in the Pacific Northwest. European countries with endemic measles in 2018 were: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than the risk of developing ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The bill for this Act of Congress was proposed by Representative Nita Lowey of New York on May 12, 2020, and was passed by the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 208–199 on May 15, 2020. The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate. The HEALS Act includes increased funding for schools and higher learning institutions, as well as hospitals. The HEALS Act would not provide additional funding for state and local governments short on tax revenue due to shutdowns and business closures, and would also reduce expanded unemployment benefits from $600 per week to $200. She indicated House Democrats were willing to negotiate reducing the House bill's cost to $2.2 trillion.\" The White House Coronavirus Task Force was led by Vice President Mike Pence, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Congress appropriated $8.3billion in emergency funding, which Trump signed into law on March 6. In April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate passed $484 billion in relief with most funding going to refill the coffers of the Paycheck Protection Program.

Black women account for over 28% of abortions yearly, more than any other racial demographic. This statistic accounts for the reality that African American women also experience high unintended pregnancy rates, largely due to lack of access to comprehensive reproductive care, including birth control. African American anti-abortionist ideals threaten the access that Black women have gained to reproductive care, something that is harmful given the high rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs, including HIV, in the Black community. Planned Parenthood services over 360,000 Black women a year with not only safe abortion care, but also affordable contraceptives, breast cancer screenings, and STI detection and treatment. are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven. Criticisms include the assumption in the Donohue-Levitt study that abortion rates increased substantially since 1973 Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade eliminated many restrictions in the United States; critics use census data to show that the changes in the overall abortion rate could not account for the decrease in crime claimed by the study's methodology (legal abortions had been permitted under limited circumstances in many states prior). During this time the Black Panthers printed pamphlets which described abortion as black genocide, expanding on their earlier stance with regard to family planning. A poll in Buffalo, \n\n York, conducted by the National Organization for Women (NOW), found that 75% of blacks supported the decriminalization of abortion. Johnson cast the issue as one which polarized the black community along gender lines: black women generally viewed abortion as a \"blessing in disguise\" but black men such as Reverend Jesse Jackson viewed it as black genocide.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Another risk factor is premature birth in which medical intervention, such as premature birth prevention or C-section delivery, can be used as prevention for intrauterine hypoxia.

Knee-high stockings are more comfortable, easier to apply, and wearing them increases patients' compliance with treatment. Knee-high stockings are easier to size for limb measurement than thigh-high compression stockings. Consequently, 22% of thigh-high wearers and 14% of knee-high wearers stopped the treatment. ; Tibial tuberosity advancement ; This surgery aims at advancing the tibial tuberosity forward in order to modify the pull of the quadriceps muscle group, which in turn helps reduce tibial thrust and ultimately stabilizes the knee. used to hold the tibial tuberosity in position. This new TTA procedure delivers the same TTA outcomes with less trauma, fewer implants, \n\n The graduated (gradient, graded) compression stockings and anti-embolism compression stockings come in knee-high and thigh-high length. was done to compare knee-high and thigh-high graded compression stockings in regards of deep vein thrombosis prevention in medical and surgical patients. The analysis determined that there was a 6% risk of developing deep vein thrombosis when wearing knee-high stockings and 4% when wearing thigh-high stockings, but also found significant heterogeneity, and thus it concluded that there is not enough evidence that that one length is superior to the other, and suggests that knee-high compression stockings should be the first choice \n\n 'closed the gap' on concerns regarding age of the patient in SDR: Columbia-Presbyterian Children's Hospital's Richard C.E.

Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. As a result, many have proposed that rather than cannabis being thought of as a psychologically harmful substance, it is instead thought of as an active placebo in which its effects on the mind are placebo effects in response \n\n Amotivational syndrome is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by signs that are linked to cognitive and emotional states such as detachment, blunted emotion and drives, executive functions like memory and attention, disinterest, passivity, apathy, and a general lack of motivation. This syndrome can be branched into two subtypes - marijuana amotivational syndrome, interchangeably known as cannabis induced amotivational syndrome which is caused by usage and/or dependency of the substance and is primarily associated with long-term effects of cannabis use, and SSRI-induced amotivational syndrome or SSRI-induced apathy caused by the intake of SSRI medication dosage. It is one of the major complications of chronic exposure to cannabis as it includes the effects and elements of cognitive deficit or cognitive impairment that are similar to what appears in schizophrenia and depression. Responsiveness to any stimuli is limited, and those affected are unable to experience or anticipate any pleasure except through the use of cannabis.

This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer. The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. More specifically, of those 1,000 men: 243 received an indication of cancer during PSA screening (most of whom then had a biopsy); of those, 3 had to be hospitalized \n\n Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC)  but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Triptans such as sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and naratriptan are 5-HT1B receptor agonists that are used to abort migraine and cluster headache attacks. The ergoline antimigraine agent ergotamine also acts on this receptor. Serenics such as batoprazine, eltoprazine, and fluprazine are agonists of the 5-HT1B receptor and other serotonin receptors, and have been found to produce antiaggressive effects in animals, but have not been marketed. Eltoprazine is under development for the treatment of aggression and for other indications. It is a derivative of the migraine medication sumatriptan, but while CP-122,288 is 40,000 times more potent than sumatriptan as an inhibitor of neurogenic inflammation and plasma protein extravasation, it is only twice as potent as a constrictor of blood vessels. In human trials, CP-122,288 was not found to be effective as a treatment for migraine, but its selectivity for neurogenic anti-inflammatory action over vasoconstriction has made it useful for research into the underlying causes of migraine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine determined that carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/day, but it failed to demonstrate that the drug was sufficiently more effective than placebo in migraine prophylaxis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Nestlé was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water and that the 0.0070mg/l found in their product was below the 0.03 mg/l threshold established by various governments and food health organizations. On March 16, 2007 pet food manufacturer Menu Foods announced a recall of dog food sold under 53 brands, and cat food sold under 42 brands, after an unknown number of animals suffered kidney failure after eating it. Mao Lijun, the general manager of Xuzhou Anying Biologic, denies directly supplying ChemNutra with the wheat gluten, claiming that \"We have never exported to the U.S.\" since they are a trading company. The contaminated products were distributed in the United States and worldwide, including in Canada and Australia. On March 16, 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration, responding to recalls of contaminated products sold by Gilchrist and after inspecting its plant, issued a warning letter to the company noting violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and mandating extensive corrective actions, resulting in a temporary shutdown of parts of Gilchrist's manufacturing plant. The FDA reports that they have received over 12,000 complaints related to the poisoning. On April 5, the company recalled all 782 tonnes of wheat gluten it had imported from Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Traditionally, cardiac CT scans are used to detect, diagnose, or follow up coronary artery disease. For more complex anatomies and procedures, such as heart valve interventions, a true 3D reconstruction or a 3D print is created based on these CT images to gain a deeper understanding. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery published a study on November 1, 2013 that confirmed MICS CABG as safe, feasible, and associated with excellent graft patency rates at 6 months post surgery, with graft patency of 92% for all grafts and 100% for left internal thoracic artery grafts. Coronary artery bypass graft patency was studied through computed tomography angiography. 92% of patients were free from angina and none of the participants experienced any aortic complications, repeat revascularizations, cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarctions or death. patients and 3.2 million patients have drawn attention to high cumulative doses of more than 100 mSv to patients undergoing recurrent CT scans within a short time span of 1 to 5 years. This creates an important issue of cancer risk to these patients. In emergency situations, echocardiography is quick, easily accessible, and able to be performed at the bedside, making it the modality of choice for many physicians. MRI coronary vessel wall imaging, although currently limited to research studies, has demonstrated the ability to detect vessel wall thickening in asymptomatic high risk individuals.

Isbell also investigated dosage effects of THC, and reported that low doses (4–6 mg) produced a pleasurable state (euphoria, perceptual distortion, and change of mood); this dosage was described by subjects as \"good reefer\". However, higher doses (18 milligrams of THC) reliably produced what Isbell referred to as a \"psychotic reaction\" (e.g., \"all of a sudden[the subject] wason a trip and watching his own burial.

He resigned and fled to Brussels, Belgium on June 28, 2015 during the 2015–2018 Burundian unrest, citing the unrest and his opposition to president Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for a disputed third term in the 2015 Burundian presidential election. He told France 24 that he \"personally advised President Nkurunziza to drop his plan for a third term, but his answer was to threaten me, to humiliate me.\" As it suppressed the rebellion, the Burundian government embarked on a programme of ethnic repression, targeting the country's remaining Hutu elites, including those who had served in government and the military. Burundian officials alleged that under interrogation he admitted to plotting the rebellion against the government with other Hutus. At the request of the Burundian ambassador, she was barred from the UN headquarters building in New York. Instead of assisting them, Ndayahoze warned Micombero and as a result 70 people were arrested. Thereafter, Micombero heavily relied on him to calm Hutus in Burundi and prevent ethnic revolt. Throughout 1971 and 1972 he wrote frequently in his reports to the presidency of the dangers of worsening ethnic relations in Burundi. The installation of Biha infuriated many Hutus and some extremist Tutsis. During Bagaza's presidency, there were long-standing tensions over the repression of the Roman Catholic Church, in a country where 65% of citizens are practising Catholics. This was later described by diplomats as a key factor in the coup.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This would account for the untimely demise of Thutmose IV and could also explain his religious vision described on the Dream Stele as this type of epilepsy is associated with intense spiritual visions and religiosity. The reasons for his relatively early death are uncertain, but there is no evidence of violence on his mummy. His mummy was found decapitated, but this was likely caused after his death by tomb robbers. Tumos, an obstacle in the whole plan, has been arrested by Benakon. When Nefertiti learns that Tumos is alive, she asks Amenophis to make him the court sculptor and order him to sculpt a bust \n\n The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment.

Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck. Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several potential anti-cancer products. On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans. Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable. In 2014, Geron licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech. The unsuccessful results of these clinical trials prompted CancerVax to say it would cut payroll by more than half to roughly 80 employees from 183. As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released. In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO at the time was Geron founder Michael D.

The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID-19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. Some of the symptoms that COVID-19 patients could experience is shortness of breath (which might be a sign of pneumonia), cough, fever, and diarrhea. The three most recorded and common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and coughing, as reported by the World Health Organization.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The side effect was rhabdomyolysis, causing kidney failure, which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class. According to the FDA, it is recommended for both healthcare professionals and patients, particularly high-risk individuals, to obtain adequate information about the adverse effect of OSP before administering and consuming this agent. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy.

The risk of acquiring phosphate nephropathy was reported to increase in parallel with the number of these listed risk factors. Older people are particularly at risk when using OSP for colonoscopy, as they have lower fluid intake, have intrinsically less bowel movements, and often have antihypertensive or nephrotoxic drugs.

Specific toxins include anatoxin-a, guanitoxin, aplysiatoxin, cyanopeptolin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, nodularin R (from Nodularia), neosaxitoxin, and saxitoxin. This results in algal blooms which can become harmful to other species and pose a danger to humans and animals if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Cyanobacteria, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that obtain energy via photosynthesis. The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, \"blue-green algae\",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in \n\n her colleagues found that the bacteria (commonly known as blue-green algae) produce an amino acid called BMAA that causes cell death and triggers the onset of the fatal disease.

Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries.

Thiazolidinediones reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures in women, possibly as a result of biasing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells away from osteoblast differentiation and toward adipocyte formation. Studies show an increased risk of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction in premenopausal women with diabetes when compared to women without diabetes. After initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density, several studies demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1,523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture. A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women.

Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older. Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their patients. Vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have good evidence to support their use. There is insufficient evidence to recommend that the general population take vitamin C to prevent pneumonia. For adults and children in the hospital who require a respirator, there is no strong evidence indicating a difference between heat and moisture exchangers and heated humidifiers for preventing pneumonia.

It was subsequently confirmed as having imprecise diagnostic criteria based on collective descriptions lacking in agreement. Simple-type schizophrenia is a sub-type of schizophrenia included in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), in which it is classified as a mental and behaviour disorder. Simple schizophrenia was included as a proposed diagnosis for further study in the appendix of the former DSM-IV. Because of this, it was perhaps the first psychiatric condition explicitly raised as specifically requiring an evolutionary explanation, \n\n The early idea that a person with schizophrenia might present solely with symptoms and indications of deterioration (i.e. presenting with no accessory symptoms ) was identified as dementia simplex. ICD-10 specifies the continuation of symptoms for a period of two years in the diagnosis of simple schizophrenia. Symptoms identified earlier to dementia simplex are now DSM-attributed by way of improvements in diagnostic technique to other classifications such as neurodegenerative disorders. In general, the condition is less dramatically psychotic than are the hebephrenic, catatonic, and paranoid types of schizophrenia. But after that, it was omitted in later versions and has since then never returned as a formal diagnosis in any DSM.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. In Fiscal Year 2014, Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the Title X Family Planning grant program. The proposed American Health Care Act, announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood \"ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants\". The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council. The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and \"among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method\". The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. Edcel Lagman denied as \"an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis\", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the \"wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations\". 43—HHS Title X Funding for Planned Parenthood Rule— reversing Obama's December 2016 regulation which had mandated that Title X recipients—like states local and state governments—distribute federal funds for services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers, regardless of whether they also perform abortions\".

Proponents such as 14 Ateneo de Manila University professors, argued thus: \"Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). The United Nations reported an abortion rate (expressed as the number of abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44) of 13.9 in 2004 and 16.9. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it. Historically, abortions have been attempted using \n\n to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The clinical sign of Alzheimer's is progressive cognition deterioration. This observation provides a molecular mechanism to explain the widely published observation that infections by certain pathogens, such as herpes virus, contribute to loss of brain function and increased incidence of Alzheimer Disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Brain atrophy is seen as an indicator of MS.

Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights. United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. view of the coronavirus pandemic, the Education Bureau closed all kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and special schools until 17 February. In the aviation industry, Taiwanese carrier China Airlines's direct flights to Rome have been rejected and cancelled since Italy has announced the ban on Taiwanese flights. Flight Centre was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a 80% decline in the company's share price (or about 85% from the August 2018 peak), cancellation of a previously announced dividend, and a suspension in trading of shares from 23 March 2020 to 7 April 2020. In early 2020, Flight Centre announced that 6,000 staff would be made redundant or placed on unpaid leave globally, due to the effects of international travel restrictions in the pandemic. On 5 March, British airline Flybe finally collapsed into administration with the loss of 2,000 jobs after failing to secure financial support. The airline said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is partly to blame for its collapse. During the pandemic, exports of many food and drink products from the UK declined significantly, and that included Scotch whisky.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms. A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched. In 1998, The Zoonotic Importance of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Transmission From Human to Monkey was noticed. In 2001, scientists noticed that antibodies peculiar to humans were found in macaque monkeys, both wild and domesticated. Of the panel of human viruses studied, measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 were found in some of the studied animals. In 2006, scientists noticed HPT of measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in the case of performing monkeys, who are \"a common phenomena in Asia\". In 2018, scientists speculated that HPT was likely to have occurred in the case of human malaria parasites. Also in 2018, scientists speculated that an outbreak of tuberculosis among a closed breeding colony of Aotus monkeys was likely due to continuing intermittent HPT exposure. While a disease specific to hominins must keep its human host alive long enough to transmit itself, zoonotic diseases will not necessarily do so as they can complete their life cycle without humans. 55% of chimps at the Gombe reserve die of disease, most of them zoonotic. When the virus infects humans, symptoms manifest as fever, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and back pain. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and a team of researchers in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from simian AIDS in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In those with a long term indwelling urinary catheter rates are 100%. This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place.

Many news outlets \n\n have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. A causative agent may not be isolated in about half of cases despite careful testing.

Intra-articular use of PSGAGs has been shown to improve lameness, signs of arthritis, joint effusion, and synovial fluid quality. IA use of PSGAGs may have an increased risk of Staphylococcus aureus infections within the joint when compared to intra-articular injections of other substances, although this can be prevented by concurrently injecting aminoglycoside antibiotics. Range of motion was slightly limited and joint was mildly swollen and tender when palpated. Patient was originally treated with splinting and ibuprofen, but this further worsened his condition. Patient was then treated with physical therapy, but symptoms persisted. Arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Commentary published by the National Health Service (NHS) called the study \"an important proof of concept\" and said it showed that tissue engineering had \"a great deal of potential.\" Between the years 2005 and 2008, four women with vaginal hypoplasia due to Müllerian agenesis were given regenerated vaginas. Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. After about eight years, all four patients reported normal function and pleasure levels during sexual intercourse according to the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire, a validated self-report tool. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible.

This is done through \"deprescribing\", where the risks and benefits are weighed when considering whether to continue a medication. This includes drugs such as bisphosphonates (for osteoporosis) where it is often used indefinitely although there is only evidence to use it for five to ten years. Some people with severe osteoporosis might be prescribed bisphosphonates to preserve bone mass, in addition to hormone replacement therapy. Other therapies, such as estrogens (e.g., estradiol, conjugated estrogens), selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., raloxifene, bazedoxifene), and bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronic acid, risedronic acid), can also be used to improve or maintain bone density. ; rheumatoid arthritis. ; low body weight. ; individuals receiving, or planning to receive, long-term glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy. ; individuals being monitored to assess the response or efficacy of an approved osteoporosis drug therapy. ; when androgen deprivation therapy is being planned for prostate cancer.

A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K (a vitamin necessary for bone health) and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2000, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n\n Cocaethylene is largely considered a recreational drug in and of itself, with stimulant, euphoriant, anorectic, sympathomimetic, and local anesthetic properties. The monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine play important roles in cocaethylene's action in the brain. Cocaethylene increases the levels of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain by inhibiting the action of the serotonin transporter, norepinephrine transporter, and dopamine transporter. These pharmacological properties make cocaethylene a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI; also known as a \"triple reuptake inhibitor\"). In most users, cocaethylene produces euphoria and has a longer duration of action than cocaine. Some studies suggest that consuming alcohol in combination with cocaine may be more cardiotoxic than cocaine and \"it also carries an 18 to 25 fold increase over cocaine alone in risk of immediate death\". Stating that contraception is a lie and \"against the beginning of new life\", the Philippine Medical Association also stressed that the \"health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer\". Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that \"The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs\" and thus are safe medicines. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000.\" The ACA coverage of female contraception has been noted to be beneficial for women.

Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. A few antibiotics have received marketing authorization in the last seven years. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\" In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President Barack Obama had been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms. On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order to implement the recommendations proposed in a report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&D of new antibiotics.

However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. A 2020 Cochrane review of studies involving men over 40 with enlarged prostates and lower urinary tract symptoms found that prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) may work similarly to common surgical options (transurethral resection of the prostate) to relieve symptoms and improve men's quality of life in the short term (up to a year). In the longer term (13–24 months), this review is very uncertain about the positive and negative effects of PAE in comparison with transurethral resection surgery. Follow up procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer (prostate biopsy) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause incontinence (inability to control urine flow) and erectile dysfunction (erections inadequate for intercourse). The Cochrane review from 2020 assessed the current evidence and found that there are great uncertainties whether PAE differs in terms of serious side effects or problems with erections compared with transurethral resection of the prostate. However, PAE may reduce problems with ejaculation. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In September 2020, Monash University Professor of Diabetes Paul Zimmet claimed that the switch to daylight saving time caused an increase in heart attacks, road accidents, workplace accidents, and cognitive dysfunction, and could amplify the health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews responded that daylight saving would be part of the forthcoming summer season. Daylight saving was widely believed to be introduced as a consumer spending initiative by local councils and tourism boards throughout New South Wales. A drought in Tasmania in 1967 led to the reintroduction of daylight saving in that state during the summer, and this was repeated every summer since then. In practice, since the late 1960s, DST across Canada has been closely or completely synchronized with its observance in the United States to facilitate consistent economic and social interaction. When daylight time became standardized across the US in 1966 when Congress passed the Uniform Time Act, Canada soon followed. The latest United States change (the Energy Policy Act of 2005), adding parts of March and November to the period during which DST is observed starting in 2007, was adopted by the various provinces and territories on the following dates:\n\n Each state and territory of Australia determines whether or not to use daylight saving time (DST).

Haroche was born 1944 in Casablanca, Morocco, and in 1971 gained a PhD from Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. He shares half of the prize for developing a new field called cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) – whereby the properties of an atom are controlled by placing it in an optical or microwave cavity. the development of atomic-scale computer simulations, which have greatly extended their power and effectiveness across an immense range of applications. ; 2008 Bryan Webber (University of Cambridge) For his pioneering work in understanding and applying quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction which is one of the three fundamental forces of Nature. ; 2009 Michael Cates (University of Edinburgh) For pioneering work in the theoretical physics of soft materials, particularly in relation to their flow behaviour. van den Broek, F.Kurlbaum, Em.Wiechert, R.Pictet, B.Rosing, P.Ehrenfest, W.de Sitter, P.Knipping, L.Shubnikov, brothers Edw.Ch. The Nobel Prize in Physics (Nobelpriset i fysik) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists who have made outstanding contributions in Physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes which were established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895. Perlmutter received one-half of the cash prize, while Riess and Schmidt shared the other half.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result \n\n reoffense. A 2016 followup by Peirson argued that \"public policy makers and leaders should be careful to not misuse the word and unwittingly stigmatize persons with mental illness and substance use disorders\". Anderson went on to promise that students will also have \"confidential and seamless access\" to psychological counselling services, paid for by the department. Harvard students currently have unlimited access to mental health services if seen by a psychologist or psychiatrist at University health services and up to 40 sessions of regular outside care with a copay as part of their continuing effort to provide access to mental health care. conditions at Pennhurst were unsanitary, inhumane and dangerous, violating the Fourteenth Amendment, and that Pennhurst used cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Retardation Act of 1966 (MH/MR). The District Court decision was the first time that any federal court ruled that an institution must be closed based on a constitutional right to community services. The rulings collectively leant credence to the nascent \"deinstitutionalization\" movement, which sought to move mental patients from hospitals to halfway houses or reintegrate them into their families.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. By 10 April, 4,072 confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. In countries where the disease has been for the past three years and the cases confirmed are local (within the confines of the country) transmission is considered to be \"endemic.\" The longest standing V. chloerae epidemic was recorded in Yemen. The epidemic in Yemen took over 2,500 lives and impacted over 1 million people of Yemen More outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Americas, and Haiti. The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10 April.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Advances in ART, however, have created new possibilities for men with male factor infertility, including those whose sperm counts have been decreased by cancer treatment and other diseases, and men with incurable, sexually transmissible virus diseases. Infectious diseases transmissible by semen for which there is no cure include:\n\n Testosterone therapy (TTh), which aims to restore testosterone levels to mid-normal ranges in men diagnosed with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), is an approved treatment. Treatment for oligospermia is centered around underlying causes, such as endocrine and systematic disorders that can cause hypogonadism. Although there is no FDA indication for use of aromatase inhibitors improving spermatogenesis, testolactone has been shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Though there is no FDA indication for the use of clomiphene in male infertility, it has been prescribed since the 1960s. Combinations of vitamins and minerals, including selenium, co-enzyme Q10, L-carnitine, folic acid, zinc, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to improve male infertility, but due to \n\n low amounts of studies and participants, more clinical studies are needed. There is evidence suggesting a significant association between vitamin D serum concentrations and the quality of sperm in men, characterized by the sperm's motility and progress motility. Washed sperm is used in artificial insemination using the intrauterine insemination (IUI) technique and in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Sperm washing is a standard procedure in infertility treatment. Once the fastest sperm have been isolated, before using them for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, it is important to confirm the absence of HIV virus in the sample. The presence of anti-sperm antibodies in infertile men was first reported in 1954 by Rumke and Wilson. It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility. If more than 10% of the sperm are bound to anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), then infertility is suspected. The blood-testis barrier separates the immune system and the developing spermatozoa.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

New diagnostic methods that are being investigated include work with anti-myelin antibodies, and studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid, but none of them has yielded reliably positive results. At the current time, there are no laboratory investigations that can predict prognosis. Medical biomarkers fall into 5 major categories: 1) diagnostic (used to identify if you have a disease or condition); 2) prognostic (used to determine how well you will do with the disease or condition); 3) predictive (used to determine if you may get the disease); 4) efficacy or monitoring (used to determine how well a drug or treatment is doing in fighting the disease) and 5) exposure (used to \n\n In 1992, a gene called apolipoprotein E was established as a possible factor in Alzheimer's disease, but its presence did not predict disease with certainty.

In short, critical gaps exist in the literature, with a paucity of prospective, controlled studies on late-life outcomes and neurodegeneration after mTBI and related basic science research.

The REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act calls for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. The bill died in the Subcommittee on Health, and also in 2013/2014 when \n\n In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or \"negligent\" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. The Obama administration's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States concluded that \"the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment.\" In the fall of 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the 'Positive Justice Project', \n\n The measure would repeal Section 31 of Article I of the California Constitution.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Nicotine patches should be removed and replaced every day at the same time. Nicotine patches are under study to help relieve the symptoms of postoperative pain and to treat early dementia. Studies are being conducted about the use of transdermal nicotine patches to treat anxiety, depression, and inattentiveness in subjects with ADHD and to treat late-life depression. Two small studies have shown that transdermal nicotine patches improve some symptoms of ulcerative colitis. However, this is not the case with Crohn's disease, a similar health condition, where smoking and nicotine intake in general worsen the disease's effects. After testing for persistence using the APT and the MTPT, the participants went through eleven days of smoking cessation therapy that included cognitive-behavioral therapy, training on coping strategies, and nicotine replacement therapy. Participants were then contacted on a \n\n A nicotine patch is a transdermal patch that releases nicotine into the body through the skin. It is used in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), a process for smoking cessation. Endorsed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is considered one of the safer NRTs available for the treatment of tobacco use disorder.

In one passage, he remarked, \"It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights.\" And don't tell me they don't have better family structures than most of us white people.\" A year later Bundy called the reaction to his statements a \"misunderstanding,\" saying he was not racist and that he should not have used the term \"Negro.\" He then proceeded to make further statements about race, comparing \"welfare and housing\" to slavery. He expressed support for Blacks who have \"raised themselves up to a point where they are equal with the rest of us.\" by a white supremacist organization at dozens of US colleges. The slogan was chanted along with \"White Power\" by up to 100 neo-Nazis rallying in Manchester, United Kingdom in March 2015 and was the theme of a March 2016 event in Swansea and a March 2017 event in Edinburgh, all of which were organized by the National Front. In an exposé from The Week, James Poulos warned that \"Europe is on track to rediscover what looks to us like a highly unsettling form of white pride.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In October 2021, another research paper reported that genetic factors influence the development of same-sex sexual behavior. The authors concluded that \"our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation\". Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality. In a 2008 study, its authors stated that \"There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in \n\n of the multiple causes of homosexuality. In 2017, Scientific Reports published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. LeVay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. They hypothesized that \"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\". Their results suggested that \"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\".\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy; from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more (as measured from the last menstrual period).

The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. The test is usually performed prior to ablative surgery for epilepsy and sometimes prior to tumor resection. The risk of post-operative cognitive change can be estimated, and depending on the surgical approach employed at the epilepsy surgery center, the need for awake craniotomies can be determined as well. During one injection, typically the left hemisphere, the patient experiences impaired speech and language or is completely unable to express or understand language.

This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed ; transcranial direct current stimulation ; resection In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period.

Davis, published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found no association between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease, discussed in the Wakefield report, \"nor any evidence that the vaccine triggered acute onset of symptoms.\" Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it.
