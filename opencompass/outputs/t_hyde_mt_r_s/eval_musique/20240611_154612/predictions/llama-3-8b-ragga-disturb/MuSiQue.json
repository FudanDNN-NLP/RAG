The couple was known to have had seven children. At the time of the English Civil War (1642-1651), the couple was reduced to poverty and forced to flee the country, living separately for several years. In March 1565, Mary Livingston married John Sempill of Beltrees, a son of Robert Sempill, 3rd Lord Sempill (c. 1505–1576), who had been born in England. The 19th-century writer Agnes Strickland researched the marriage, noting that it was delayed rather than \"shame-hastened\" as Knox suggested, and had been discussed in autumn 1564. By 1546 Mary had married her cousin Sir Anthony Heveningham (1507–1557) by whom she had five children, including Arthur Heveningham, and her youngest daughter, Abigail (wife of Sir George Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire), who was later in attendance on Queen Elizabeth in 1588. She was buried in Heveningham church, Suffolk, on 8 January 1571. She married Brian O'Rourke around 1575 or 1576. The couple had two other sons, Art and Eogan. After the separation, she wished to marry John Fitzgerald, the brother of James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, but he was killed in \n\n  Elizabeth was born on 28 December 1635 at St James's Palace and was baptised there five days later, on 2 January, by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n"

He fought in World War I, Polish–Soviet War and World War II, serving in the military forces from 1914 until 1945. Born on 18 September 1894 in the village of Gostkowo, Russian-controlled Congress Poland, Smoleński studied at the University of Liège, Belgium, and at Warsaw University of Life Sciences, where he joined the Riflemen's Association and moved from Congress Poland to Austrian Galicia. On 6 August 1914 Smoleński marched from Kraków towards Russian Poland, as a soldier of 2nd Platoon, First Cadre Company. He then served in 1st Uhlan Regiment of Władysław Belina-Prażmowski. After the end of the war, Jaruzelski graduated from the Polish Higher Infantry School and then from the General Staff Academy. Born to Polish nobility in Kurów in eastern Poland, Jaruzelski was deported with his family to Siberia by the NKVD after the invasion of Poland.

The medieval historian Henry of Huntingdon conceived the idea of the Heptarchy, which consisted of the seven principal Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (Heptarchy literal translation from the Greek: hept – seven; archy – rule). Initially, the National Assembly seemed willing to allow a place for the caliphate in the new regime and Mustafa Kemal did not dare to abolish the caliphate outright, as it still commanded a considerable degree of support from the common people. It was sometimes used in Morocco by the Alaouite dynasty until it was definitely abolished by King Mohammed V (1957–1961) who introduced agnatic primogeniture. The Crown of Aragon and its institutions were abolished in 1716 only after the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) by the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain. The old regime was swept away, the administration was subsumed into the Castilian administration, the lands of the Crown were united formally with those of Castile to legally form a single state, the kingdom of Spain, as it moved towards a centralized government under the new Bourbon dynasty.\n\nQuestion: When was the kingdom that Heptarchy was part of abolished?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Initially, the National Assembly seemed willing to allow a place for the caliphate in the new regime and Mustafa Kemal did not dare to abolish the caliphate outright, as it still commanded a considerable degree of support from the common people. It was sometimes used in Morocco by the Alaouite dynasty until it was definitely abolished by King Mohammed V (1957–1961) who introduced agnatic primogeniture. The Crown of Aragon and its institutions were abolished in 1716 only after the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) by the Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip V of Spain. The old regime was swept away, the administration was subsumed into the Castilian administration, the lands of the Crown were united formally with those of Castile to legally form a single state, the kingdom of Spain, as it moved towards a centralized government under the new Bourbon dynasty.\n\n"
