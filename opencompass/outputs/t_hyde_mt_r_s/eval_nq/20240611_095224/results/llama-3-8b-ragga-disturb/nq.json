This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet. Most shore stations monitor several frequencies. Because of the nature of radio wave propagation, communications made via short-wave radio can be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment and knowledge. One disadvantage may be that one requires training and licensing to transmit using a short-wave radio, in many countries. At this time, not all of their antennas appear to be in use. This does not work for single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic \"Donald Duck\" sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single-sideband AM is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications because it has power and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers.

The key words here are fair and eventually – if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance.

His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities surrounded by parks. Howard wanted the cities to be proportional with separate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the Utopian novel Looking Backward and Henry George's work Progress and Poverty, Howard published his book Garden Cities of To-morrow in 1898. His work is an important reference in the history of urban planning.

In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths. The outer most region of the eye is the cornea, light passes through the cornea first. \"The image formed by the cornea is upside down and reversed from right to left. \"(Journey N, 1997-2019) The layers of the cornea in raptors include the, Anterior corneal epithelium, Anterior limiting lamina (Bowman's layer), Substantia propria (stroma comprising the majority of corneal thickness),Posterior limiting lamina (Descemet's membrane) Posterior epithelium (endothelium).

It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. In the middle of the retina is the fovea, which contains a high concentration of cones. Cones are responsible for colour vision and have high spatial acuity, whereas rods are not. Rods are instead responsible for vision at lower light.

Gallstone ileus is a rare form of small bowel obstruction caused by an impaction of a gallstone within the lumen of the small intestine. Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Once a fistula has formed, a stone may travel from the gallbladder into the bowel and become lodged almost anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name \"gallstone ileus\" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone). Porcelain gallbladder is a calcification of the gallbladder believed to be brought on by excessive gallstones, although the exact cause is not clear. As with gallstone disease in general, this condition occurs predominantly in overweight female patients of middle age. It is a morphological variant of chronic cholecystitis. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the recommended treatment. Gallbladder disease is a frequent cause of abdominal pain, but can also result in critical illness. Women in the first trimester of pregnancy can have a tubal or ectopic pregnancy outside the uterus \n\n Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this.\n\nQuestion: where is gall bladder situated in human body\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The United States Mint has issued legal tender coins every year from 1792 to the present. From 1934 to the present, the only denominations produced for circulation have been the familiar penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar. The last gold coins were minted in 1933. The last 90% silver coins were minted in 1964, and the last 40% silver half dollar was minted in 1970.

The country's economy is almost entirely dependent on oil production, with oil exports accounting for approximately 98 percent of government revenues in 2011 according to the International Monetary Fund. Industrial fishing also makes an important contribution to the economy of the region and small-scale artisanal fisheries provide a living for thousands of Angolans and South Africans. In Namibia, more than 20 species are fished commercially and approximately 90% of the catch is exported. It has the highest Human Development Index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60% of Angola's economy, almost all of the country's revenue and all of its dominant exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed 1.4 Moilbbl/d in late 2005 and was expected to grow to 2 Moilbbl/d by 2007. According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative American think tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.

Where taxpayers do not pay tax owed, the IRS has strong means to enforce collection. taxes do not cover all taxes due, all taxpayers must make estimated tax payments or face penalties. Taxpayers have rights to appeal any change to tax, and these rights vary by jurisdiction. Taxpayers may also go to court to contest tax changes. The IRS has an additional three more years to make changes if the taxpayer has substantially understated gross income. The period under which the IRS may make changes is unlimited in the case of fraud, or in the case of failure to file a return. Taxpayers who fail to file returns, file late, or file returns that are wrong, may be subject to penalties. These penalties vary based on the type of failure. Some penalties are computed like interest, some are fixed amounts, and some are based on other measures.

In more modern times, the monarch left it to the politicians involved to choose a successor through private consultations (Winston Churchill in May 1940, Harold Macmillan in January 1957, Alec Douglas-Home in October 1963). Nowadays, the monarch has no discretion, as the governing party will elect a new leader who will near-automatically be appointed as he or she commands the support of the majority of the Commons (most recently Theresa May in 2016 or Boris Johnson in 2019).

After entering an ovum cell through the micropyle, one male nucleus fuses with the polar bodies to produce the endosperm tissues, while the other fuses with the ovule to produce the embryo. In gymnosperms, the ovule is not contained in a carpel, but exposed on the surface of a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. When semen is released into the vagina, the spermatozoa travel through the cervix and body of the uterus and into the fallopian tubes where fertilization usually takes place. Many sperm cells are released with the possibility of just one managing to adhere to and enter the thick protective layer surrounding the egg cell (ovum). The first sperm cell to successfully penetrate the egg cell donates its genetic material (DNA) to combine with the DNA of the egg cell resulting in a new organism called the zygote. In contrast, the mitochondrial DNA of the zygote comes entirely from the egg cell. Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters \n\n  Sperm competition is the competitive process between spermatozoa of two or more different males to fertilize the same egg during sexual reproduction.

The sperm cell becomes a pronucleus after the sperm enters the ovum, but before the genetic material of the sperm and egg fuse.

The origin seems to be related to a continuous differentiation throughout the growth of the tissue and even further differentiation during adulthood. The vertical structure of the eye has two layers. The sclera, also known as the white of the eye or, in older literature, as the tunica albuginea oculi, is the opaque, fibrous, protective, outer layer of the human eye containing mainly collagen and some crucial elastic fiber. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. The human eye is relatively rare for having a pale sclera (relative to the iris). The outer nuclear layer (or layer of outer granules or external nuclear layer), is one of the layers of the vertebrate retina, the light-detecting portion of the eye. from 1mm at the posterior pole to 0.3 mm just behind the rectus muscle insertions. The sclera's blood vessels are mainly on the surface. Along with the vessels of the conjunctiva (which is a thin layer covering the sclera), those in the episclera render the inflamed eye bright red.

The book popularized the work of population genetics to other biologists, and influenced their appreciation for the genetic basis of evolution. In his book, Dobzhansky applied the theoretical work of Sewall Wright (1889–1988) to the study of natural populations, allowing him to address evolutionary problems in a novel way during his time. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the \n\n The book began as a series of lectures at Columbia University in October and November 1936. He envisioned two parts &ndash; \"part I containing data on the sources of evolutionary change, and part II containing a discussion of their interactions leading to race- and species formation.\" After the lectures (for which he received $500), Dobzhansky returned to Pasadena, and in December Columbia University \n\n include paleontology, systematics and botany in a series of notable books: Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) by Ernst Mayr; Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and Variation and Evolution in Plants (1950) by G. Ledyard Stebbins. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species.\n\nQuestion: who wrote the book the origin of species\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Speakers of these languages are currently scattered over most of Asia north of 35 °N and in some eastern parts of Europe, extending in longitude from Turkey to Japan. It was widely accepted until the 1960s and is still \n\n The Oghuz languages are a sub-branch of the Turkic language family, spoken by approximately 108 million people. The three languages with the largest number of speakers are Turkish, Azerbaijani and Turkmen, which combined account for more than 95% of speakers. Swedish turcologist and linguist Lars Johanson notes that Oghuz languages form a clearly discernible and closely related block within the Turkic language family as the cultural and political history of the speakers of Oghuz languages has linked them more closely up to the modern age. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Neo-Aramaic, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian and Greek. The Finnish language is spoken by the majority of the population in Finland and by ethnic Finns elsewhere. Unlike the languages spoken in neighbouring countries, such as Swedish and Norwegian, which are North Germanic languages, or Russian, which is a Slavic language, Finnish is a Uralic language of the Finnic languages group.

Historically, menstrual product advertising has had to balance frankness and information with taboos and censorship laws against discussing or showing menstrual themes. Educational pamphlets and school outreach has been an important way of marketing to young consumers during the twentieth century One common way that sanitary-product advertising avoids depicting menstruation is by pouring a blue, rather than red, liquid on the sanitary product to demonstrate its absorptivity. Historically, this has been due to strict censorship rules regarding menstrual product advertising. In 2010, the \"Always\" tampon brand created \n\n Menses is another way of wording menstruation or blood flow discharge from the uterus. Within the Diseases of Women I, the average amount of menses for healthy women should be somewhere around a half pint for around two-three days. A menstruation period longer than four days was thought to be an indicator of more delicate embryos. Less than three days is said to indicate robust and healthy individuals but would lead to likely infertility. The term menstrual inequity refers to the disparities in affordability, accessibility, destigmatization, and safety of menstrual products. Menstruation is a highly stigmatized biological process, to the extent that most women feel uncomfortable discussing their experiences. Menstrual products are part of menstrual culture, as they are prominent in shops, through advertising and through disposal methods (such as sanitary bins and bags).

On April 6, 1917, Congress officially declared war against Germany and joined the Allied forces. Led by General John J. Pershing, the American Expeditionary Forces arrived in Europe in June 1917. The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, nearly three years after World War I started. Before entering the war, the U.S. had remained neutral, though it had been an important supplier to the United Kingdom, France, and the other powers of the Allies of World War I.

He also said that, \"The current political assumption ignores both the problems of resource depletion and inequity, which leads to human unhappiness.\" In its place, McKibben suggested that the focus should be on \"deep economy\", which includes, rather than constant growth, a consideration of human satisfaction. According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. Responding to the Great Depression of the 20th century, in the 1930s Michał Kalecki and John Maynard Keynes concurred with the latter theory, suggesting that \n\n The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who posited that fractional reserve banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes which leads to an artificial \"boom\". Mises stated that this artificial \"boom\" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called \"malinvestment\" - which eventually must end in a \"bust\". Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment\n\nQuestion: who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when \"spirits\" was a synonym for hard liquor. Bartholomew Traheron, in his 1543 translation of John of Vigo, introduces the word as a term used by \"barbarous\" authors for \"fine powder.\" By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including \"alcohol of wine,\" the distilled essence of wine. Libavius in Alchymia (1594) refers to \"vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum\". Johnson (1657) glosses alcohol vini as \"quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.\" The word's meaning became restricted to \"spirit of wine\" (the chemical known today as ethanol) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as \"alcohols\" in modern chemistry after 1850.

There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis.

Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. There are also enzymes (enterocyte digestive enzyme) on the surface for digestion. They have a large surface area so there will be more efficient absorption of fatty acids and glycerol into the blood stream. Intestinal villi (singular: villus) are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. Each villus is approximately 0.5–1.6 mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances. The digestive system comprises a foregut, a midgut and a hindgut, and is situated dorsally. The hepatopancreas feeds into the midgut, where digestive enzymes are released, and nutrients taken up. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus.

Digestion involves both mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine.

Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). Intramembranous ossification forms the flat bones of the skull, mandible and hip bone. In the fetus, the formation of the calvaria involves a process known as intramembranous ossification. Ossification (or osteogenesis) in bone remodeling is the process of laying down new bone material by cells named osteoblasts. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, healthy bone tissue: Intramembranous ossification is the direct laying down of bone into the primitive connective tissue (mesenchyme), while endochondral ossification involves cartilage as a precursor. It is a process that occurs during ossification, but not necessarily vice versa. Endochondral ossification is the formation of long bones and other bones. There are two centers of ossification for endochondral ossification. Chondrocytes multiply and form trebeculae.

Wine grapes represent 11% of total vineyard area. An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is a designated appellation for American wine in the United States distinguishable by geographic, geologic, and climatic features, with boundaries defined by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the United States Department of the Treasury. Over half (142) of the AVAs are in California. American Viticultural Areas range in size from the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA at 29900 sqmi across four states, to the Cole Ranch AVA in Mendocino County, California, at only 62 acre. Michigan wine refers to any wine that is made in the state of Michigan in the United States. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007. Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA. There are also a few disjunct wineries in every region of the state, including some in the Upper Peninsula that have opened over the past several years. York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes, just behind California and Washington. It has AVA's near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island, and in the Hudson Valley has the second-most productive area in the country for growing apples, making it a center for hard cider production, just like New England.\n\nQuestion: what are the top five wine producing states\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From any polyhedron one can form a graph, by letting the vertices of the graph correspond to the vertices of the polyhedron and by connecting any two graph vertices by an edge whenever the corresponding two polyhedron vertices are the endpoints of an edge of the polyhedron. This graph is known as the skeleton of the polyhedron. A graph is planar if it can be drawn with its vertices as points in the Euclidean plane, and its edges as curves that connect these points, such that no two edge \n\n Mantel's theorem states that any n-vertex undirected graph with at least n2/4 edges, and no multiple edges or self-loops, either contains a triangle or it is the complete bipartite graph Kn/2,n/2. w(H) > r if and only if for every set of r vertices in L(H) there is a vertex not adjacent to any of them. ; mw(H) > r if and only if for every set of r vertices in L(H) there is a vertex not adjacent to any of them, and in addition, there is an independent set I in L(H) which contains a vertex not adjacent to any such set.

There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. The judgments made by the justices of the peace can, with some exceptions, be appealed to the tribunals of first instance. Judge advocates occupying the position of staff judge advocate (SJA) serve on the special and personal staff of general officers in command and who are general court-martial convening authorities (in other words, who have the authority to convene a general court-martial). This branch of government explains and applies the laws by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases. Among other responsibilities, the Chief Judge has the ceremonial duty of administering the oath of office of the Governor. In modern tradition, the Chief Judge retires voluntarily at sixty years of age, or statutorily at sixty-five years of age. Most appointments to the judiciary are made by the Governor, but acting upon the recommendation of the National Judicial Council.\n\nQuestion: what is the job of justice of the peace\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. This was the second and last year that write-in votes were allowed at the Oscars. Its score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. According to Landis, Oscar was stylistically influenced by older Hollywood comedies, particularly those belonging to the \"screwball\" genre, that were popular during the period in which the film takes place. Oscar was released in the United States on April 26, 1991, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards at the 63rd Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director for Costner, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Mixing. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. It is one of only three Westerns to win the Oscar for Best Picture, the other two being Cimarron (1931) and Unforgiven (1992). to 2020, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Clark interpreted the Court's precedents in determining if the search of the Kers’ apartment and car were reasonable. Land was in the spotlight in late 2009 when he tried the case Rhodes v. Macdonald, in which Army physician Connie Rhodes attempted to secure a restraining order against her being deployed to Iraq on the argument that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and was ineligible to serve as President. Within hours of Land's decision, the physician's attorney, Orly Taitz, told the news site Talking Points Memo that she felt Land's refusal to hear her case was an act of treason. The evidence turned up by the INS and FBI searches was used in Abel's trial, in which he was convicted and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Abel, represented by James B. Donovan, appealed to the Supreme Court that the searches violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and thus the evidence should not have been used at his trial. Thus the case was re-argued to decide the issues reformed as follows: \n\n Murphy, a citizen of the Muscogee-Creek Nation, admitted to committing murder in the state of Oklahoma, and was subsequently tried by the state courts around 2015. During these trials, Murphy argued that the language of the Oklahoma Enabling Act did not specify that the Native American reservations were disestablished, and because he had committed the murder within the Muscogee reservation territory, that his crime was subject to federal jurisdiction and not state under the Major Crimes Act. This argument was rejected by the state and on its first appeal within the federal courts, but at the Tenth Circuit in 2017, the court found in favor of Murphy's argument that the Enabling Act did fail to disestablish \n\n In the 2010 campaign, Susan B.

The Bay of Montevideo (Bahía de Montevideo) is the bay around the city of Montevideo, Uruguay in the Rio de la Plata. In 1680, Portuguese colonists established Colônia do Sacramento on the northern bank of Río de la Plata, on the opposite coast from Buenos Aires. The 1750 Treaty of Madrid secured Spanish control over Banda Oriental (present day Uruguay), and settled the boundaries between Spain and Portugal. In 1816, Portugal conquered Banda Oriental from Spain and incorporated the territory into the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and it became the Cisplatina province within Brazil. It is one of the major ports of South America and plays a very important role in the economy of Uruguay.

The following year, \"Basque\" won the Grammy for Best Instrumental, and a guest concert appearance at Wembley Arena John made on George Michael's cover of \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" was released as a single and topped the charts in both the UK and the US. John performed \"Believe\" at the 1995 Brit Awards and won the Outstanding Contribution to Music prize. A duet with Luciano Pavarotti, \"Live Like Horses\", reached number nine in the UK in December 1996.

Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. A graphite pencil, also called a lead pencil, is a type of pencil in which a thin graphite core is embedded in a shell of other material. Production technology has changed little over the past 120 years; only standards and mechanisms for the manufacture of graphite rods and wooden halves have improved. The hardest pencil contains about 20% graphite, the softest one up to 90%. The origin of lead-tin-yellow can be dated back to at least the thirteenth century when Type II was applied in frescos, perhaps having been discovered as a by-product of crystal glass production. Until the eighteenth century, Type I was the standard yellow used in oil painting. After 1750, no paintings seem to have been made containing the pigment, and its existence was eventually forgotten for reasons that are not entirely clear. A large deposit of graphite was discovered in 1565 on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. Because the pencil core is still referred to as \"lead\", or a \"lead\", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, even though it never contained the element lead.\n\nQuestion: when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is called \"touch DNA\" because it only requires very small samples, for example from the skin cells left on an object after it has been touched or casually handled, or from footprints. Touch DNA analysis only requires seven or eight cells from the outermost layer of human skin. The technique is very similar to Low Copy Number DNA analysis, to the extent that court rulings have sometimes confused the two. However, in LCN DNA analysis, the DNA goes through additional cycles of PCR amplification. particularly the weakness of the hydrogen bonds and electronic interactions that hold strands of DNA together compared to the strength of the bonds within each strand.

In mixed inhibition, the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, i.e. a site different from the active site where the substrate binds. This process is known as phosphorylation, where the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group to the substrate molecule. Conversely, it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group (producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP). These two processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during glycolysis. The phosphorylation state of a molecule, whether it be a protein, lipid or carbohydrate, can affect its activity, reactivity and its ability to bind other molecules. Returning to glycogen phosphorylase, the less active \"b\" form can itself be activated without the conformational change. This amplifies the effect of activating glycogen phosphorylase. Refer to glycolysis for further information of the regulation of glycogenesis. In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.\n\nQuestion: which site of an enzyme is called allosteric site\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the modern Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in 1828: \"Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. It was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party. Since the 1860s, its main political rival has been the Republican Party. Before 1860, the Democratic Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of Reconstruction after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. The New Deal attracted strong support for the party from recent European immigrants, many of whom were Catholics based in the cities, but caused a decline of the party's conservative pro-business wing. The party opposed a national bank and Great Britain. The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the Era of Good Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president. Jackson and Martin Van Buren worked with allies in each state to form a new Democratic Party on a national basis.

It was published to document the veracity of the depiction of slavery in Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Uncle Tom's Children is a collection of novellas and the first book published by African-American author Richard Wright, who went on to write Native Son (1940), Black Boy (1945), and The Outsider (1953). The book's title is derived from Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, an anti-slavery novel published in 1852. At the time of the novel's initial publication in 1851, Uncle Tom was a rejection of the existing stereotypes of minstrel shows; Stowe's melodramatic story humanized the suffering of slavery for white audiences by portraying Tom as a Jesus-like figure who is ultimately martyred, beaten to death by a cruel master because he refuses to betray the whereabouts of two women who had escaped from slavery. Stowe reversed the gender conventions of slave narratives by juxtaposing Uncle Tom's passivity against the daring of three African American women who escape from slavery. The novel was both influential and commercially successful, published as a serial from 1851 to 1852 and as a book from 1852 \n\n Uncle Tom is the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. Stowe read the first edition of Henson's narrative and later confirmed that she had incorporated elements from it into Uncle Tom's Cabin.\n\nQuestion: where was uncle tom 's cabin first published\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out across the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. After completing glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, approximately 30–38 ATP molecules are produced per glucose. Found in all known forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the \"molecular unit of currency\" of intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. Oxidative phosphorylation is the process driving ATP synthesis by means of the energy of O2 released through the oxidation of reducing equivalents. It occurs in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of transmembrane protein complexes that catalyze redox reactions. As protons move down the electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane protein ATP synthase, ATP is generated from ADP and an inorganic phosphate group.\n\nQuestion: where does the formation of atp take place\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The motor neurons of the different motor fibers, were the lower motor neurons – alpha motor neuron, beta motor neuron, and gamma motor neuron having the Aα, Aβ, and Aγ nerve fibers respectively. the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain the same in muscles that contract during locomotor activity. In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, \n\n Excluding reflexes, all skeletal muscles contractions occur as a result of conscious effort originating in the brain.

Via an expeditious and reproducible process, a polypeptide folds into its characteristic three-dimensional structure from a random coil. Each protein exists first as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil after being translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids. At this stage the polypeptide lacks any stable (long-lasting) three-dimensional structure (the left hand side of the first figure). As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by \n\n A codon table can be used to translate a genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. The DNA codons in such tables occur on the sense DNA strand and are arranged in a 5′-to-3′ direction. This problem was overcome in the 1960s by the use of reticulocytes in vertebrates, which produce large quantities of mRNA that are highly enriched in RNA encoding alpha- and beta-globin (the two major protein chains of hemoglobin). This additional functionality is reflected in the increased complexity of the translation process, making it a hard object to investigate. Yet details on when and what mRNA is translated and what mechanisms are responsible for this control are key to understanding of normal and pathological cell functionality. They join by condensation reactions to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. In Nature, the process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is an RNA copy of one of the organism's genes.\n\nQuestion: where is the protien made in the cell\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Panasonic Toyota Racing was a Formula One team owned by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation and based in Cologne, Germany. Toyota announced their plans to participate in Formula One in 1999, and after extensive testing with their initial car, dubbed the TF101, the team made their debut in 2002. Toyota drew criticism for their lack of success, as they never managed to win a Grand Prix with one of the sport's biggest budgets along with being the world's largest car manufacturer. Toyota was a well-funded team, but despite this, strong results had never been consistent. The Toyota MH20 is a concept car introduced in 1972, at the 19th Tokyo Motor Show. The Japanese automobile manufacturer Daihatsu, a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota Group since 2016, has produced a multitude of vehicles since its inception in 1951. Son to the company founder, Toyoda, in 1952, joined his father's business at Toyota Motors. The merger of the sales and production organizations in 1982 produced Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyoda's leadership would be integral to the global introduction into popular culture of the Lexus brand of luxury automobiles and environmentally focused Prius engine electric hybrids.\n\nQuestion: when did toyota first come to the united states\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Temps des fêtes (Candlemas) was long celebrated at the end of the Christmas season in both Quebec and in Acadian communities. A recent folk tradition that adapts a custom from France is the Tintamarre parade of Acadia, similar to France's Medieval Charivari festivities. The musical's emblem is a picture of the waif Cosette sweeping the Thénardiers' inn (which occurs in the musical during \"Castle on a Cloud\"). It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The statue of Hercules, placed at the station commemorating the fall of Louis XVI, symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors. In one hand, the statue grasped a club, a symbol of power, while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people. Other aspects of Quebec folklore include superstitions surrounding objects, events, and dreams. Listed below are objects along with a brief description of the superstition associated with them. Other prominent symbols include the national motto \"A Mari Usque Ad Mare\" (From Sea to Sea), the sports of hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada Goose, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, the  Canadian parliamentary complex, the Canadarm, and more recently the Canadianization of totem poles and Inuksuks.

In Galatians, Paul says that James, Peter and John will minister to the \"circumcised\" (in general Jews and Jewish proselytes) \n\n Some early Jewish Christians believed that non-Jews must convert to Judaism and adopt Jewish customs in order to be saved. Paul criticized Peter for himself declining to eat with gentiles during a visit by some of these Christians and therefore presenting a poor example to non-Jews joining the Christians. Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch and at the Council of Jerusalem. Rejected by the Jews, the message is taken to the Gentiles under the guidance of Paul the Apostle. The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial. Paul was in contact with this community. He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord,\" which may explain why the early texts contain scarce information about Peter. According to Dunn, this was not an \"usurpation of power,\" but a consequence of Peter's involvement in missionary activities. Paul himself described several meetings with the apostles in Jerusalem, though it is difficult to reconcile any of them fully with the account in Acts (see also Paul the Apostle).\n\nQuestion: which apostle spoke at the council of jerusalem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo Vs. System, starting with Baseball (1983) and Tennis (1984). The new magazine was founded by Nintendo of America marketing manager Gail Tilden in 1988. Of this issue, 3.6 million copies were published, with every member of the Nintendo Fun Club receiving a free copy. From the beginning, Nintendo Power focuses heavily on providing game strategy, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. In its early years, ads only appeared in the first and last few pages of the magazine, leaving no \n\n Before Internet connections became widespread, there were few services for digital distribution of games, and physical media was the dominant method of delivering video games. The service allowed Atari 2600 owners to use a specialized cartridge to connect through a phone line to a central server and rent a video game for 5–10 days. From 1987 to 2003, Nintendo's Japan-only Disk Writer kiosks allowed users to copy from a jukebox style of rotating stock of the latest games to their floppy disks. There were also examples such as Soft bender TAKERU for PCs, which also served as a distribution system for karaoke. With the lowered prices, popularity of the video game industry continued to grow and the first video game magazine, Electronic Games, was printed. However, attempts to copycat on the success of the Atari 2600 saturated the market, and the video game crash of 1983 decimated the industry in the United States. With the American-produced games on the downswing, Nintendo successfully launched the Nintendo Entertainment System in America in 1985, revitalizing the market with the introduction of the third and fourth generation of home consoles such as the Master System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari 7800, and the TurboGrafx-16, with systems transitioning to support 3D graphics and support for optical media rather than cartridges.\n\nQuestion: what was the first video game for nintendo\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some neurons such as photoreceptor cells, for example, do not have myelinated axons that conduct action potentials. Other unipolar neurons found in invertebrates do not even have distinguishing processes such as dendrites. Afferent nociceptive fibers (those that send information to, rather than from the brain) travel back to the spinal cord where they form synapses in its dorsal horn. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. The cells in the dorsal horn are divided into physiologically distinct layers called laminae. Aδ fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, Aβ fibers connect with lamina I, III, & V. After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order nociceptive project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white commissure. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the cerebral cortex in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 1) Somatic receptors in the skin, muscles and tendons ; 2) Afferent nerve fibers carry signals from the somatic receptors to the posterior horn of the spinal cord or to the brainstem ; 3) An integrating center, the point at which the neurons that compose the gray matter of the spinal cord or brainstem synapse ; 4) Efferent nerve fibers carry motor nerve signals from the anterior horn to the muscles ; 5) Effector muscle innervated by the efferent nerve fiber carries out the response.

Low voltage: Between 50 V AC and 1,000 V AC or 120 V and 1,500 V ripple-free DC, or an electrical potential between a conductor and earth less than 600 V AC or 900 V ripple-free DC. Almost all domestic and light commercial (e.g., offices) power is low voltage for regulation purposes. ; High voltage:Any voltage in excess of low voltage; usually found in industrial processes and electricity transmission and distribution networks. ; Extra-low voltage (ELV): 50 V AC or 120 V ripple-free DC, or less. ; Separated extra-low voltage (SELV): Extra-low voltage system that is also electrically isolated. A separate earth conductor will normally be supplied in both cases but may not be present depending on the connection type. This isolation is used to protect against electric shock, to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, or to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected. Isolation transformers block transmission of the DC component in signals from one circuit to the other, but allow AC components in signals to pass. Transformers in the locomotives transform this power to a low voltage and high current for the motors. A similar high voltage, low current system could not be employed with direct current locomotives because there is no easy way to do the voltage/current transformation for DC so efficiently as achieved by AC transformers.

A common building material in central Mexico was tezontle (a light, volcanic rock). It was common for palaces and monumental structures to be made of this rough stone and then covered with stucco or with a cantera veneer. Very large and ornate architectural ornaments were fashioned from a very enduring stucco (kalk), especially in the Mayan region, where a type of hydraulic limestone cement or concrete was also used. In the case of the common houses, wooden framing, adobe, and thatch were used to build homes over stone foundations. However, instances of what appear to be common houses of limestone have been discovered as well. Buildings were typically finished with high slanted roofs usually built of wood or thatch although stone roofs in these high slant fashions are also used rarely. Traditionally, burhs were constructed first with a massive series of banks fronted by a ditch. The stone was cut to size, transported to the site and laid without mortar. To prevent flooding, 100 spouts are installed at each corner, each with a unique carved gargoyle in the shape of a giant or makara. Borobudur differs markedly from the general design of other structures built for this \n\n For centuries Engans have constructed dwellings made from locally available bush materials. Roof construction is often of a crude thatch type, waterproofing being obtained by repeated lighting of a heavily smoking fire inside and the accretion of the soot onto the roofing material.

In broad terms, it can be viewed as the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body's tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate \n\n Toughness in meat is derived from several proteins, such as actin, myosin and collagen, that combined form the structure of the muscle tissue. Heating these proteins causes them to denature, or break down into other substances, which in turn changes the structure and texture of meat, usually reducing its toughness and making it more tender. Forcemeat is a mixture of ground, lean meat emulsified with fat. The emulsification can be accomplished by grinding, sieving, or puréeing the ingredients. The emulsification may either be smooth or coarse in texture, depending on the desired consistency of the final product. Forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie. In US usage, there are four basic styles of forcemeat.

Written by Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878, sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It first replaced \"God Save the Queen\" in 1974 as the official national anthem, following a nationwide opinion survey. \"God Save the Queen\" became known as the royal anthem, which is used at public engagements attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family.

Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt). For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the March and September equinoxes, when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

The nickel is the only coin whose size and composition (5 grams, 75% copper, and 25% nickel) is still in use from 1865 to today, except for wartime 1942-1945 Jefferson nickels which contained silver. Due to the penny's low value, some efforts have been made to eliminate the penny as circulating coinage.

Eighty percent of the population work in agriculture, primarily grain and paddy. The Indian Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare alongside Indian Council of Agricultural Research, has taken several policies towards this. Indians consider Ashok Vatika, a garden in Hindu epic Ramayana, which consisted of plants and fruit-bearing trees, as an example of an agroforestry system. Since the 1970s, in line with initiatives taken by other countries, the Indian government has also promoted research in the field of agroforestry. Even though agriculture was valued by social and religious practices; some experts noted that various government regulations were seen as an impediment in advancing agroforestry. Another aspect for the need of an agroforestry policy was the lack of the forest and tree cover in India. According to the Forest Survey of India in 2019, the country had 80.7 million hectares of forest and tree cover, which accounts to 24.56% of the total geographic area in the country; however, the country requires one third (33.3%) of its land under forest and tree cover, according to the National Forest Policy. ; The industrial growth for the current year has been listed as 2.5% while the agricultural growth is 2.8%. ; Total formal employment has increased from 2011–12. ; India is on a growth path that delivers sustainable development and has a\n\nQuestion: what is the share of agriculture in indian economy\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Setting a legal drinking age of 21 is designed to discourage reckless alcohol consumption by youth, limiting consumption to those who are more mature, who can be expected to make reasonable and wise decisions when it comes to drinking. Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. Reagan said that although he wished states would create their \n\n legislation to increase the drinking age, a federal law had to be implemented to avoid blood borders, or teenagers driving to the nearest state with a lower drinking age. Reagan threatened states with withholding 5% of federal funding for highways if they did not comply with increasing the drinking age to 21. The legal drinking age was set to 21 years of age because studies showed that the leading cause of death of people age 1 to 34 accounted for one third of deaths due to unintentional injury from alcohol consumption. The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment.\n\nQuestion: when was the drinking age set to 21\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The equation for the reaction of glucose to form lactic acid is: Anaerobic respiration is respiration in the absence of. These include nitrate, sulfate, and carbon dioxide. This results in the complete combustion of the acetyl-CoA to CO2 and water. The energy released in this process is captured in the form of 1 GTP and 11 ATP molecules per acetyl-CoA molecule oxidized. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules in the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every \"turn\" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism.

About 12.5mm (0.5 inch) posterior to the globe, the central retinal artery turns superiorly and penetrates the optic nerve, continuing along the center of the optic nerve, entering the eye to supply the inner retinal layers. The central retinal artery pierces the eyeball close to the optic nerve, sending branches over the internal surface of the retina, and these terminal branches are the only blood supply to the larger part of it. The central part of the retina where the light rays are focused after passing through the pupil and the lens is a circular area called the macula.

It has a complex life cycle and is thought to be venomous and to have caused injuries to humans. Traditionally jellyfish have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a body plan largely based on water that offers little nutritional value or interest for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the ocean sunfish and the leatherback sea turtle.

As with all siphonophores, string jellyfish may appear to be a single organism, but each specimen of Apolemia uvaria is a colony of specialised minute organisms called zooids. String jellyfish are colonial animals that may reach 3 m in total length and have a diameter of 2–5 cm. It occurs above the continental slope but is more common over the deep ocean, seldom occurring at a depth greater than 200 m.\n\n In 2020 researchers working off the coast of Western Australia came across an Apolemia which had coiled itself into a spiral form. This would make it longer than any other animal on the planet, if one includes colonial animals, although individuals of the lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) are known to be nearly as large; the largest known specimen of the latter had tentacles as long as 37 m and was projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75 m, making it one of the longest extant non-colonial animals.\n\nQuestion: which is the lion 's mane jellyfish 's species within its genus\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Under this military strategy, formulated by Count Schlieffen in 1905, Germany would launch a lightning attack on France through the poorly defended Low Countries. The same month, the French Commander-in-Chief, General Robert Nivelle, ordered a new offensive against the German trenches, promising that it would end the war within 48 hours.

Prior to 2006, the key in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments was a trapezoidal shape. The most-commonly enforced rule on the key is the \"three seconds rule\" in which the team of a player on offense who stays on the key for more than three seconds loses possession of the ball. Another rule is the lane violation which occurs if a player from either team enters the key before a free-throw shooter releases the ball in the act of shooting. A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player. ; 1938 – The laws are completely rewritten and reorganized by a committee under the leadership of Stanley Rous. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws.

In American professional basketball, defending team players are prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless the player is directly guarding an offensive player. Otherwise if a defender exceeds that time, the defending team is charged with a defensive three-second violation, which results in a technical foul where the team with the ball is awarded one free throw, plus retaining possession and a reset of the shot clock.

The pier now offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers. The pier is 312 m long and 48 ft above high water. The supporting piles, which are made of cast iron, are 2 ft in diameter at the seabed. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986.

And then Gary read the lyrics and was, like, \"These are brilliant, dude.\" The eighth track on the album is \"My Dilemma\", a Kelly Clarkson-esque pop rock song about conflicted feelings towards a potential breakup. In the song, Gomez demands that her negligent man does the cooking, cleaning, and housework, commanding him \"Make me dinner and bring it to me.\" \"Outlaw\" is a bleak cautionary tale and revenge ballad lyrically similar to Carrie Underwood's \"Cowboy Casanova\" and Lady Gaga's \"Monster\".

The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: \"There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends.\" For the refrains, she speaks of setting fire to photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, \"As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn\".

Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. However, textbooks often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, and there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak. German grammar is the set of structural rules of the German language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages. Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. The corresponding verbs (haben and sein respectively) are very common in German. German verbs are often treated in a sentence as though they were Russian verbs, being russified by replacing the German infinitive verb ending. The following features vary from speaker to speaker: \n\n The German language has several different ways of forming the plural. Sometimes the stress in the plural form is changed, for example der Muslim → die Muslime. example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely -e for the first-person singular, -st for the informal second-person singular, -t for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and -en for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural.\n\nQuestion: how many strong verbs are there in german\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He arose like a storm of wind and fire from the infernal pits of Angband beneath the Iron Mountains, as a last defense of the realm of Dor Daedeloth. Near the end of the War of Wrath that pitted Morgoth's hosts against the Host of the Valar, Morgoth sent Ancalagon to lead a fleet of winged dragons from the fortress of Angband to destroy the Dark Lord's enemies. Winged dragons first appeared during the War of Wrath, the battle that ended the First Age. Some dragons, known as \"Fire-drakes\" (\"Urulóki\" in Quenya), are capable of breathing fire. It is not entirely clear whether the \"Urulóki\" were only the first dragons such as Glaurung that could breathe fire but were wingless, or to any dragon that could breathe fire, and thus include Smaug. Like the Old Norse dragon Fafnir, they are able to speak, and can be subtle of speech. Tolkien wrote that Glaurung had four legs and no wings and could not fly, and sired the brood of Urulóki, wingless fire-breathing dragons. He is a main antagonist in The Children of Húrin, in which he sets in motion events that bring about the protagonist Túrin Turambar's eventual suicide before being slain by him. He is described as having four legs and the ability to breathe fire, but no wings.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the dragon in eragon\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an isocost curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that isocost curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle isoquant, the lowest cost can be obtained by using amounts of labor and capital such \n\n the point on the given isoquant is on the lowest possible isocost curve—that is, at the point of tangency between the given isoquant and one of the cost curves. This optimization can be formalized as follows:  for demand for physical capital. 1) Many goods need to be produced to create one whole product.

Seafloor core evidence indicates that there have been forty-one subduction zone earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 10,000 years, suggesting a general average earthquake recurrence interval of only 243 years. The region has experienced severe earthquakes in the past, including several megathrust earthquakes. Though earthquakes are common in Alaska, they often occur out at sea. This earthquake is more similar to the 2001 Nisqually earthquake located near Tacoma, Washington, than to the 1964 megathrust earthquake. The Cascadia Subduction Zone, which forms the boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates, is a very long sloping fault that stretches from mid-Vancouver Island to Northern California. Because of the great length of the fault, the Cascadia Subduction Zone is capable of producing very large earthquakes if rupture occurs along its entire length. Another notable intraslab earthquake in the Puget Sound region was the magnitude 6.8 2001 Nisqually earthquake. Intraslab earthquakes in Cascadia occur in areas where the subducting plate has high curvature. Similar to the distribution of interplate earthquakes in Cascadia, intraslab earthquakes are infrequent in Oregon, with its strongest earthquake since statehood being the 5.6 magnitude 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake, an oblique-slip quake. The shock was located in the area between Olympia and Tacoma, and was felt throughout the state, as well as parts of Oregon, British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana.

U.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics of the modern era, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which the U.S. boycotted in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden did not attend the 2014 Winter Olympics, reportedly to protest against Russia's anti-gay laws. The results were amended due to the Russian doping scandal. The United States competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. At the closing ceremony, a segment of American culture was performed, as the country hosted the next Olympics in Atlanta.

Schumacher published a collection of essays on shifting towards sustainable living through the appropriate use of technology in his book Small Is Beautiful. History The discussion of sustainability in film began in the early 1990s, as reported in The Hollywood Reporter and Variety . Manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources and innovation to impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. “Human beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future. is a staple of sustainable living practices. Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice. Lester R. Brown, a prominent environmentalist and founder of the Worldwatch Institute and Earth Policy Institute, describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as \"shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system.\" From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:   However, despite the work of a worldwide environmental movement, many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the United Nations Environment Programme, and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest ecological footprint data shows the world's footprint increased from about 50% undershoot in 1961 to 50% overshoot in 2007, the last year data is available. In 1972 the first edition of The Limits to Growth analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a system dynamics model.\n\nQuestion: when did the term sustainability start to be used\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The corresponding electrical energy generation mix was 64.5% coal, 24.0% natural gas, 5.6% solar, 2.2% hydroelectric, 2.1% wind, 0.8% geothermal, and 0.2% biomass. Waste heat recovered from industrial operations (0.5%) and petroleum-fired peaker plants (0.1%) generated the remainder. Coal previously generated 81% of Utah's electricity in 2013, and has been undergoing a gradual replacement with natural gas and renewables.

The Tennessean governor was not entitled to many powers at the time, but used the position to publicize his views.

Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. Geographically, the departments of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. In April 1991, during the negotiations between the government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front to end the Salvadoran Civil War, an agreement was reached to reform various articles of the Constitution. One of these reforms was the conversion of the Central Electoral Council into the Supreme Electoral Court, and the addition of the two non-partisan members onto the makeup of the Court. The first challenge the new Court faced was the 1994 Salvadoran general election. Whilst the International Foundation for Electoral Systems' observers found that \"the El Salvador voting process was conducted in an orderly, peaceful and transparent fashion which permitted the popular will of the Salvadoran people to be expressed\", concerns were \n\n Article 208 of the Constitution of El Salvador establishes that \"there will be a Supreme Electoral Court which will be formed of five Judges, who will remain on the Court for five years and will be chosen by the Legislative Assembly\", and that \"three of the Judges will each come from one of the three political parties or coalitions who obtained the greatest number of votes in the last presidential election\". El Salvador elects its head of state &ndash; the President of El Salvador &ndash; directly through a fixed-date general election whose winner is decided by absolute majority. Salvadorans also elect a single-chamber, unicameral national legislature &ndash; the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador &ndash; composed of 84 members (deputies).\n\nQuestion: what type of political system does el salvador have\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005 to commemorate Bill Russell. Since its inception, the award has been given 53 times to 31 players. Klay Thompson led the Warriors with 34 points.

The reorganisation of the plate boundaries in Iceland has also been attributed to microplate tectonics. The Iceland hotspot is a hotspot which is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the Iceland Plateau and the island of Iceland. Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, with eruptions occurring on average roughly every three years (in the 20th century there were 39 volcanic eruptions on and around Iceland). About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions.

Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Britain's declaration of war automatically committed India, the Crown colonies, and the protectorates, but the 1931 Statute of Westminster had granted autonomy to the Dominions so each decided their course separately. Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies immediately joined the British declaration on 3 September, believing that it applied to all subjects of the Empire and Commonwealth.

In the 1840s, after becoming acquainted with Samuel Morse, Cornell became involved in the creation of telegraph lines in the Northeastern United States, and in 1855 he founded the Western Union Telegraph Company. As a Republican, he served on the New York State Assembly and later the New York State Senate throughout the 1860s and established a public library in Ithaca in 1863. Cornell died in Ithaca on December 9, 1874. Mr. Bancroft planned to include this copy in \"Autograph Leaves of Our Country's Authors,\" which he planned to sell at a Soldiers' and Sailors' Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. As this copy was written on both sides of the paper, it proved unusable for this purpose, and Mr. Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This copy remained in the Bancroft family for many years until it was donated to the Carl A. Kroch Library at Cornell University by Nicholas H. Noyes and can be viewed by anyone who asks. Out of five known manuscripts, Cornell's copy is the only one owned by a private institution. Among historians, Cornell's manuscript is known as the Bancroft Copy. Karl Richard Lepsius. Cornell's collection of Egyptian papyri was started in March 1889 with a gift by former President Andrew Dickson White. The long roll, mounted and framed, hung for many years over the \n\n A.D. Hopkins, commonly referred to as the father of forest entomology in the United States, formulated the record-keeping system that now bears his name. Hopkins brought his system to the federal government when he came to work for the Division of Entomology in the late 1890s, by which time he had already been using his record-keeping system at West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, where he previously worked. The System contains U.S. in its name to distinguish it from those earlier Hopkins records at West Virginia University. For example, in the fall of 2005, Chinua Achebe came to Cornell and discussed his Things Fall Apart ('09).\n\nQuestion: who invented the cornell method of note taking\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Mraz further explained the track, in a \"track-by-track\" commentary for Billboard: \"I try to keep my music gender neutral, but this is obvious, it's called 'The Woman I Love,' but I'd like to dedicate to the men in the relationships because every so often the woman forgets her own greatness and she goes a little bat sh-- crazy sometimes.

The key difference between a manufacturing \n\n To those who are concerned that nations may be losing a net number of jobs due to outsourcing, some point out that insourcing also occurs. A 2004 study in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. The New York Times disagreed, and wrote that free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies \"offshored\" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return. A 2012 series of articles in Atlantic Magazine   highlighted a turning of the tide for parts of the USA's manufacturing industry. Specific causes identified include rising third-world wages, recognition of hidden off-shoring costs, innovations in design/manufacture/assembly/time-to-market, increasing fuel and transportation costs, falling energy costs in the US, increasing US labor productivity, and union flexibility.

This may mean that Galatians at the time were already bilingual in Greek, as St. Jerome later reports. However, scholars are divided as to whether Paul was writing to Greek Galatians or to the Hellenized descendants of the Celtic Galatians. A similar challenge is presented by Galatians 2:15 and 16, just after the Incident at Antioch, in which Paul says (speaking to Peter, a fellow Jew), \"We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\" The division between the Jews who followed the Mosaic Law and were circumcised and the Gentiles who were uncircumcised was highlighted in his Epistle to the Galatians:\n\n A major theme of Paul's Epistle to the Romans is said to be that, so far as salvation is concerned, Jews and Gentiles are equal before God (2:7-12; 3:9-31;  4:9-12;  5:12,17-19;  9:24;  10:12-13;  11:30-32). A problem with this argument, however, is the context of Galatians 5. Galatians 5:4 in particular, says, \"You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.\" Line this up with Galatians 2, Galatians 2:21 in particular, which says \"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ \n\n The Epistle to the Galatians says that, prior to his conversion, Paul was a Pharisee who \"violently persecuted\" the followers of Jesus. \"You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism.

In 300 BC or 299 BC, Pyrrhus of Epirus \n\n Aeschylus was born in c. 525 BC in Eleusis, a small town about 27 km northwest of Athens, in the fertile valleys of western Attica. Some scholars argue that his date of birth may be based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. But this might be a fiction invented by the ancients to account for the grandeur of Aeschylus' plays. As a youth, Aeschylus worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer Pausanias, the god Dionysus visited him in his sleep \n\n commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy. As soon as he woke, he began to write a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was 26 years old. In 510 BC, when Aeschylus was 15 years old, Cleomenes I expelled the sons of Peisistratus from Athens, and Cleisthenes came to power. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of Eleusis. Agathon introduced certain innovations into the Greek theater: Aristotle tells us in the Poetics (1456a) that the characters and plot of his Anthos were original and not, following Athenian dramatic orthodoxy, borrowed from mythological or historical subjects. Agathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and \n\n Aristophanes (, ; c. 446 – c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion (Cydathenaeum), was a comic playwright or comedy-writer of ancient Athens and a poet of Old Attic Comedy.

Following on the popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, a battle royale game released earlier in 2017, Epic developed a variant of Fortnite called Fortnite Battle Royale, which was released in September 2017 as a free-to-play title across computer, console, and mobile platforms.

The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. In 1927, Warner Bros. released the first feature-length film with sound, The Jazz Singer, whose audio track was recorded with a proprietary technology called Vitaphone. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a single color, used in many films in the 1920s. The finished film print was projected, three frames at a time, through the corresponding color filters. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors. It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes. An ordinary projector could therefore be used, if \n\n green and white.\n\nQuestion: when did movies start coming out in color\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A similar arrangement is seen in the cerebellum. The structure of a neuron is seen to consist of two separate functional regions, or compartments – the cell body together with the dendrites as one region, and the axonal region as the other. Brain cells make up the functional tissue of the brain. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Neurons are often grouped into a cluster known as a nucleus where they usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. Nerve fibers are classed into three types – group A nerve fibers, group B nerve fibers, and group C nerve fibers. These groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers. Another classification groups only the sensory fibers as Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV. An axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of a neuron; the other type is a dendrite. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while \n\n usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, \n\n Neurons are cells that are specialized to receive, propagate, and transmit electrochemical impulses.

The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the East River in New York City, connecting Lower Manhattan at Canal Street with Downtown Brooklyn at the Flatbush Avenue Extension. The main span is 1480 ft long, with the suspension cables being 3224 ft long. The bridge's total length is 6855 ft. It is one of four toll-free vehicular bridges connecting Manhattan Island to Long Island; the nearby Brooklyn Bridge is just slightly further downtown, while the Queensboro and Williamsburg bridges are to the north. Considered the forerunner of modern suspension bridges, it served as the model for many of the record-breaking spans built in the first half of the twentieth century. The $35,000, 240 ft original was completed in December 1855, and was built of materials transported from Troy, New York, via Cape Horn. Built in 1911, it has an overall length of 680 ft and a main span of 660 ft. The suspension design was chosen to address the steep-walled canyon at the crossing, which required a single span with no temporary falsework. The bridge towers rest \n\n the lake, where it is still open to foot traffic. At the time, it was one of the highest suspension bridges in the world 627 ft above the original streambed), but with the creation of the lake, the bridge now sits just above the water level when the lake is full.\n\nQuestion: how long is the famous suspension bridge in san francisco and what is it called\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cyrus described it as a \"total dance track\" with a cool concept. Cyrus depicted the club scene to be very sexy, which she thought was primarily composed by the music playing and intense lighting, and thought that it might trigger fake emotions with the person one is dancing with. She stated, \"If you're out, dancing at a club, the way the whole vibe is [...] Do you actually like the person you're dancing with or is just the whole ambiance of what's going on?\" Singer Ian Thornley said: \"It actually came from one particular moment where I came out of a supermarket… and it was the same thing of [thinking about] the same person… almost wanting to dwell on it. Then you really get into it and you’re really down on yourself and you really want to fucking wallow in it, so you go and put on that song… and it doesn’t work. And she leaned in to kiss me, sat next to me on the piano seat, as I'm playing her this song, and I thought, \"Oh my god!\" \"''the beat is unique sounding and the strings are so good that they will have to be used on future songs\". \"It's a sexy record, plus a swagger record, an anthem record all in one.

The collaboration marks Rodgers' fifth, Moran's seventh, and Davis' first number one, on Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the summit in its July 29, 2017 issue. In an interview with Billboard the artists discussed how the collaboration came together, which began after Rodgers heard a rough demo of the song. \"I hope our song makes people feel good, as though they’re in the middle of a party, letting go and having fun.\"\n\nQuestion: who sings i want to dance with you\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They describe the \"wonderful times / many natural highs\" which they have experienced. At the climax of the song, Ludwig sings (in operatic style) a bridge begging Julie to \"come across\" the \"river between [them]\" in the name of love. The chorus is sung again, this time slower and in an operatic style by Ludwig with Julie performing vocal embellishments to the lyrics. The duo then join in unison for the final chorus, which returns to the dance beat and varies the opening line to \"off again, on again\", implying that they have resolved their differences. Composed by Philip Vella with lyrics by Gerard James Borg, the song is a combination of dance music and opera. He goes on to wonder what the pair have in common anymore. The second verse takes much the same form, with Julie pledging her love for Ludwig, who describes her as \"the air, [...] the love that I breathe\" and \"the magic that flows from within\". The duo sings the chorus in unison, describing their love as being \"like the rhythm of rain\" and needing to \"find an end to this game\" \n\n The other characters think, correctly, that Laurey (Joan Roberts) and Curly (Alfred Drake) are in love.

In many countries, lucrative natural resources industries, especially the petroleum industry, are controlled by government-granted monopolies. The early 19th century Gibbons v. Ogden case weakened the steamboat monopoly that New York had granted, producing an exception for interstate commerce. As a form of coercive monopoly, government-granted monopoly is contrasted with a coercive monopoly or an efficiency monopoly, where there is no competition but it is not forcibly excluded. Advocates for government-granted monopolies often claim that they ensure a degree of public control over essential industries, without having those industries actually run by the state. Opponents often criticize them as political favors to corporations. Government-granted monopolies may be opposed by those who would prefer free markets as well as by those who would prefer to replace private corporations with public ownership. National Postal, telegraph and telephone service monopolies were enforced in many countries until the late 20th century. Telstra, for example, had a legal monopoly on telecommunications in Australia.\n\nQuestion: what is an example of a government monopoly in the united states\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Johnson performed the song in the key of E, and recorded two takes, the second of which was used for the LP. The song uses the melody made popular by the hit record M & O Blues by Walter Davis. Johnson composed two songs to this melody - \"Ramblin' On My Mind\" and \"When You Got A Good Friend\" - with different musical approaches and different guitar tunings, although both were in the key of E. Eric Clapton recorded the song for the 2004 album Me and Mr. Johnson. \"I've Got Friends\" is a song by American indie rock band Manchester Orchestra. Until 2017, \"I've Got Friends\" was Manchester Orchestra's only top-10 chart success and their highest-charting song; this feat was bested by \"The Gold\", which reached No. \"I've Got Friends\" was used in multiple video game soundtracks, such as MLB 11: The Show and Dirt 3, as well as in the television show The Vampire Diaries. The song was Rogers' second number one country hit as a solo artist. During the chorus, the lyrics — \"If you wanna be my lover/You gotta get with my friends\" —address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, while the ascending group of chords and the number of voices creates a sense of power that adds to the song's level of excitement. Towards the end, Brown and Halliwell rap the bridge, which serves as a presentation to each of the girls' personalities. The group repeats the chorus for the last time, ending the song with energetic refrains— \"Slam your body down and wind it all around\"—and the word \"zigazig-ah\". \"You Are My Friend\" is a ballad co-written and recorded by American singer Patti LaBelle, released as the second single off her self-titled debut album, in 1978 on the Epic label.\n\nQuestion: who sang the song you got a friend in me\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs, albeit often semantically related, and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm. (The first two pairs of cranial nerves arise from the cerebrum). Thus, brainstem damage is a very serious and often life-threatening problem. There are three main functions of the brainstem:\n\nG-Stem is the base stem, from the German Grund (\"ground\") ; D-Stem typically has a Doubled second root letter ; L-Stem typically Lengthens the first vowel ; N-Stem has a prefix with N ; C- or Š-Stem often has a Causative meaning and has a prefix with Š (ʃ pronounced like English sh), S, H, or ʔ (the glottal stop). The stems can contain secretory canals with resin, or latex which is particularly common among the Cichorioideae. The brainstem (or brain stem) is the posterior stalk-like part of the brain that connects the cerebrum with the spinal cord. In the human brain the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The brainstem is very small, making up around only 2.6 percent of the brain's total weight. Ten pairs of cranial nerves come from the brainstem. It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch).\n\nQuestion: what are the main functions of the stem\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Only the dose makes a thing not a poison\" (see median lethal dose). The term \"poison\" is also used in a figurative sense: \"His brother's presence poisoned the atmosphere at the party\". For instance, several kilograms worth of water would constitute a lethal dose. Throughout human history, intentional application of poison has been used as a method of murder, pest-control, suicide, and execution. As a method of execution, poison has been ingested, as the ancient Athenians did (see Socrates), inhaled, as with carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide (see gas chamber), or injected (see lethal injection). While arsenic is a naturally occurring environmental poison, its artificial concentrate was once nicknamed inheritance powder. In toxicology, the lethal dose (LD) is an indication of the lethal toxicity of a given substance or type of radiation. Because resistance varies from one individual to another, the \"lethal dose\" represents a dose (usually recorded as dose per kilogram of subject body weight) at which a given percentage of subjects will die. and Mrs. Ross offers her the antiseptic to bathe it, when she discovers she has carried away the medicine, leaving the poison for the child to give grandma.

The nervous system runs through the connective tissue and just below the epidermis, and is controlled by a pair of ganglia. Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells. The membranous layer or stratum membranosum is the deepest layer of subcutaneous tissue. However, prominent areas of the membranous layer are called fascias; these include the fascia of Scarpa in the abdomen and the fascia of Colles in the perineum. Although the skin is a large and logical target for drug delivery, its basic functions limit its utility for this purpose. The skin functions mainly to protect the body from external penetration (by e.g. There are two important layers to the human skin: (1) the Epidermis and (2) the Dermis.

Turpin and Lucas had each been convicted in separate murders, and their executions were Canada's last before capital punishment was abolished. For offences committed prior to 2 December 2011 all life sentences and related parole ineligibility periods are served concurrently (at the same time). In cases of multiple murder, where the offence occurred after 2 December 2011 (the date new legislation came into force), a court may, after considering any jury recommendation, order consecutive parole ineligibility periods for each murder. There is no death penalty in Canada, making life imprisonment the most severe punishment to be imposed in the country. The death penalty was abolished in 1964 for all but the murder of Gardaí, diplomats and prison officers.

It also creates a reducing environment in streams, lakes, and groundwater. [15] Because of its high reactivity with other molecules, increased sulfur concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to ozone depletion and start a positive warming feedback. rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon. \"Clean\" or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. The combustion process of petroleum, coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall.

After he was orphaned, he entered the Dominican monastery in Zaragoza in 1582. In 1606, Father Javierre, who had been his prior at Zaragoza convinced him to come to Madrid as his assistant. On 6 December 1608 he was named confessor of Francisco Gómez de Sandoval, 1st Duke of Lerma, favourite of Philip III of Spain. The last person to be burned alive at the stake on orders from Rome was Giordano Bruno, executed in 1600 for a collection of heretical beliefs including Copernicanism, belief of an unlimited universe with innumerable inhabited worlds, opinions contrary to the Catholic faith about the Trinity, divinity of Christ, and Incarnation. Another prominent form of fanaticism according to some came a few centuries later with the Spanish Inquisition. Selengut said, \"The inquisitions were attempts at self-protection and targeted primarily \"internal enemies\" of the church\". The driving force of the Inquisition was the Inquisitors, who were responsible for spreading the truth of Christianity. Selengut continues, saying: The inquisitors generally saw themselves as educators helping people maintain correct \n\n At the beginning of the 13th century, the Catholic Church instituted the papal or monastic Inquisition, an official body charged with the suppression of heresy. The Spanish Inquisition was particularly brutal in its methods, which included the burning at the stake of many heretics. In Seville, in April 1562, the Inquisition made an auto-da-fé in which an effigy of him was burned.

The film is based on J. M. Barrie's 1904 play, Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, and was adapted by Paul Leadon. The film was produced by Roz Phillips and featured music composed by John Stuart. The special featured a live production of the 1954 musical adaptation of Peter Pan, televised from Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York, starring Allison Williams in the title role and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook. The production employed a CGI version of Tinker Bell: rendered live and controlled by a technician, it expressed emotions and thoughts by changing its size and color. He presents Wendy as their loving mother as long as she remains in Neverland, which she meekly resists. Many adventures follow, as Peter Pan, the children and the Lost Boys battle against Captain Hook, save Wendy from his wicked intentions, and rescue the young Indian Princess Tiger Lily while Hook gets chased \n\n Peter and Wendy is a 2015 television film made for ITV in the UK. The film is based on the story of Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie, blending it with an original narrative set in the present day.

The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day. Black History Month has expanded further to Canada, where it is also celebrated in February, and to the United Kingdom, which celebrates it in October. It was first self-declared Indian Day in 1945, by Jules Sioui and chiefs from across Turtle Island (North America). Also in that same year, a national conference of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people chaired by Elijah Harper, titled The Sacred Assembly, called for a national holiday to celebrate the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to Canada. National Indigenous Peoples Day is now the first of a series of Celebrate Canada days, followed by the National Holiday of Quebec on \n\n 1870s as a community that defined itself by dual loyalties on one hand, and in another as \"a unified common organism,\" which gathered in strength on the basis that they had a common past, \"not a religious one but one that centered on the common Irish experience of British oppression and suffering\". In other words, this goes to show that the shifting character of commemorative rituals experienced during the Saint Patrick's parade have influenced the development of American culture in a larger sense, since it contributed to enriching its heritage and making of its Irish-American Diaspora a prideful concept to be celebrated and admired.

The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee. It is homologous to the region of the leg that lies between the knee and the ankle joints, the crus. Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet. Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers.

The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. The left atrium lies to the left and slightly posterior of the right atrium. At birth, the ductus arteriosus is still open, and there is higher than normal resistance to blood flow in the lungs. When the ductus begins to close and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, blood flow through the ductus is restricted and flow to the lungs is increased. In typical anatomy, the left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. Its inferior surface lies over the central tendon of the diaphragm. Last portion is a muscular outlet portion (infudibulum) that pumps the blood to the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary and systemic circulations take the blood through large arteries first and then branches into smaller arteries before reaching arterioles and capillaries. After capillaries, the blood enters the venules before joining smaller veins first and then larger veins before reaching the right heart.\n\nQuestion: where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dixon was a keen photographer, and in 1937 he produced his first Christmas cards. Initially, he was producing postcards under contract for W. J. Nigh & Sons Ltd, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. From 1937 (evidenced by a postmark on a colour tinted photo card of Shanklin Old Village) he was producing postcards on his own account. In 1951, more than 14 million greetings cards were produced and in 1955, nearly 30 million postcards. This was taken advantage of by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who had his postcards copyrighted on 17 December 1861, yet none of his printed-message cards is known to have been used. Charlton allowed Hymen L. Lipman to print a second series of cards, which carried the name \"Lipman's Postal Card\". The earliest known postmark on these cards is of 25 October 1870; the patent that Lipman applied for was never granted. The origin of modern trading cards is associated with cigarette cards first issued by the US-based Allen and Ginter tobacco company in 1875. They were the precursors of the sport cards and other trading cards. Her Children in Wonderland is also quite good.” In 1891 W.A Mansell & Co. announced that they were reinventing Christmas cards from being ‘mere flimsy pasteboard with hackneyed quotations’ to ‘objects of design, skilled execution and literary style’. The following year The British Trade Journal writes of the success of the new idea and that the “firm has spared no trouble and cost in procuring new designs by well-known artists…we notice a number of charming sketches by Miss Laura Troubridge printed in red and gold and in colours”\n\nQuestion: who commissioned the first christmas card in 1943\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She departed from New York on the first flight of the Dixie Clipper across the Atlantic. The purpose of the flight was to deliver the Zeppelin to its new owners, the United States Navy, who rechristened the ship USS Los Angeles. By 1929, Lehmann had filed a declaration of intent to become a United States citizen, but changed his mind when he was given charge of the Hindenburg in 1936. In 1935, when Hermann Göring created the Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei to increase Nazi influence over zeppelin operations, Captain Lehmann was named director of the new airline. In 1936, he commanded 10 round-trip flights to Lakehurst on the new Hindenburg. He was severely burned when the ship caught fire at Lakehurst on 6 May 1937, and died the following day. During a deathbed conversation with Commander Charles Emery Rosendahl, he said \"it must have been an infernal machine.\" Lehmann's two-year-old son had died on Easter Sunday, 28 March 1937, a few weeks prior to the Hindenburg's last crossing and he did not really want to make the voyage. By the time it was taken out of service in June 1937, the zeppelin had made 590 flights, each flight carrying up to 12 tons of mail to and from dozens of countries around the world. Although LZ 129 Hindenburg is most famous for its fiery end, for the 14 months of its existence, it carried considerable amounts of mail overseas, and many of those are readily available today. The LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II was the last of the zeppelins to carry mail; it was in civilian service for only a few months, from October 1938 to August 1939, and made only 30 trips, all within Germany.\n\nQuestion: where was the hindenburg scheduled to fly and how many passengers were on it\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Act II was preceded in the popcorn market by Act I, an early microwave popcorn that had to be stored in the refrigerator due to its real butter content. Act II was manufactured by the Golden Valley Microwave Foods (frequently abbreviated as GVMF on the packaging) company of Edina, Minnesota. The popcorn bag used in Act II was invented by James Watkins, a former engineer for the Pillsbury Company in Minneapolis, MN and then Founder/President of Golden Valley Microwave Foods. Thomas Edison was slow to develop a projection system at this time, since his company's single-user Kinetoscopes were very profitable. However, films projected for large audiences could generate more profits since fewer machines were needed in proportion to the number of viewers.

In his concessions he planned on his customers eating their dinner with the movie adding chicken wings and buffalo shrimp to the selection. On one such occasion, Paul recalled, his mother spotted a single piece of popcorn on the floor next to an ornate piece of royal furniture, which was completely blocked off from public access. He remembers his mother wondering aloud, where did that popcorn come from?

When Austrian, British, Prussian, and Russian armies invaded France in 1814, Napoleon was forced to abdicate. Under Louis XVIII, no major changes were made to the army, beyond the recreation of several regiments of the pre-revolutionary maison militaire du roi. However, when Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, the army, for the most part, went over to his side, and Louis fled. The First French Empire was the regime established by Napoleon I in France. This empire lasted from 1804 to 1814, from the Consulate of the First French Republic to the Bourbon Restoration, and was briefly restored during the Hundred Days in 1815. The Second French Empire was the regime established in France by Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic. After Russia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. In 1870, Napoleon III led France to a disastrous defeat at the hands of Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, and he subsequently abdicated.\n\nQuestion: what emperor took over france after the reign of terror\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was also the first of three stories written for the series by Chris Boucher and the first of five directed by Pennant Roberts. In the serial, the powerful split-personality computer Xoanon (played by Tom Baker, Rob Edwards, Pamela Salem, Anthony Frieze, and Roy Herrick) attempts to create two super races from the descendants of a human expedition with eugenics—the savage Sevateem, and the psychic Tesh. The resulting tension between the good and evil aspects of the girl's nature provides the basis for much of the show's conflict and suspense.

This would have insulted both Hindu and Muslim religious practices; cows were considered holy by Hindus, while pigs were considered unclean (Haram) by Muslims. The old aristocracy, both Muslim and Hindu, who were seeing their power steadily eroded by the EEIC, also rebelled against British rule. Another important source of discontent among the Indian rulers was that the British policies of conquest had created significant unrest. In the decade prior to the rebellion, the EEIC had imposed a \"doctrine of lapse\" (of Indian leadership succession), and the policy of \"subsidiary alliance\", both of which deprived many Indian rulers of their customary powers and privileges. Thus, the Hindu soldiers viewed the Act as a potential threat to their faith.

The story goes that once Cash heard this news he never sang the song again.\" The song was a number one hit on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts published by RPM, reaching its peak on both charts for the week of December 31, 1977. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: \"Lady\" in 1980 and \"You Were a Good Friend\" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor.

No drilling has yet been accomplished, so information on microbes comes from samples of hydrothermal fluids coming out of vents. Characterized by hydrothermal circulation, they extend to about 80 million years in age. This circulation is driven by latent heat from the cooling of crust, which heats seawater and drives it up through more permeable rock. In the younger crust, there is a lot of iron and sulfur cycling. Sediment cover slows the cooling and \n\n the flow of water. The subducting plate releases volatiles and solutes to these volcanoes, resulting in acidic fluids with higher concentrations of gases and metals than in the mid-ocean ridge. When hotspot volcanoes occur in the middle of oceanic plates, they create permeable and porous basalts with higher concentrations of gas than at mid-ocean ridges. The continental margins and continental shelf mark lower density, but greater thickness felsic continental rock that is often much older than that of the seafloor. The oldest oceanic crust in the Atlantic is up to 145 million years and situated off the west coast of Africa and east coast of North America, or on either side of the South Atlantic. In many places, the continental shelf and continental slope are covered in thick sedimentary layers. Oceanic detachment faults occur at spreading ridges where magmatic activity is not enough to account for the entire plate spreading rate. They are characterized by long domes parallel to the spreading direction (oceanic core complexes of the footwall). They cannot be structurally restored, as slip on the fault exceeds the thickness of oceanic crust (~30 km compared to ~6 km, for example). The footwall is also much more extensively hydrothermally altered than in continental settings.\n\nQuestion: where does new crust come from in sea floor spreading\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Once the drawer is reset back to its starting amount for the next cashier's shift, it is either placed in the safe or given to another cashier that is starting their shift.\n\nQuestion: where do you get a cashiers check from\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to author Bruce Spizer, the line-up for the basic track, before overdubs, was Lennon (vocals, acoustic guitar), Harrison (electric guitar), Preston (organ), Voormann (bass) and White (drums). A friend of the Beatles since their years in Hamburg, Klaus Voormann played upright bass. Pop culture author Robert Rodriguez describes \"Sunshine Life for Me\" as a song \"custom-crafted\" for Starr, who had previously demonstrated an affiliation for country music in his White Album composition \"Don't Pass Me By\" and in his 1970 country album Beaucoups of Blues, which he recorded in Nashville with producer Pete Drake. Harrison recalls in I, Me, Mine that it was \"a fun session and a good track\". Robertson also expressed his enjoyment, saying that after Harrison showed them the song, he and his bandmates \"went into our mountain-music mode\". He then recorded the track during the main sessions for the album, held at FPSHOT through to September 1980. Aside from Harrison, who also served as producer, the musicians at the sessions were Neil Larsen and Gary Brooker (both on keyboards), Ray Cooper (percussion), Willie Weeks (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums). The latter's presence marked the first time he had played on a Harrison \n\n once, and she shredded 10 times better than I ever played it\". Another guest was guitarist Pat Smear, who had been a bandmember from 1995 to 1998, and a guest musician on the tour for In Your Honor.\n\nQuestion: who played guitar on my guitar gently weeps\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The main characters of the show are the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth (and Space Beth), their children Summer and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle, Washington. Dan Harmon has described Rick and Morty as \"a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism\". Thereunder, Troy Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty \"supplies an artful answer to the question of what follows postmodernism: a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes, all at once, leavened by some humanistic wistfulness.\" Rick and Morty is an American animated science-fiction comedy franchise whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a 2006 parody film of Back to the Future for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon. After six years, the sketch was developed into Rick and Morty, a half-hour prime time show that was a hit for Adult Swim, receiving universal acclaim across all seasons.

In 1966, Delhi was converted into a union territory and eventually the Chief Commissioner was replaced by a Lieutenant Governor. The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi. New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of the government of India, hosting the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House, and the Supreme Court of India. The foundation stone of New Delhi was laid by George V during the Delhi Durbar of 1911. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931, by Viceroy and Governor-General Irwin. It is bordered by Telangana to the north-west, Chhattisgarh to the north, Odisha to the north-east, Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the west and the Bay of Bengal to the east. However, it had become the centre of the nationalist movements since the late nineteenth century, which led to the Partition of Bengal by Viceroy Lord Curzon. The anti-colonial sentiments amongst the public led to a complete boycott of British goods, which forced the colonial government to reunite Bengal and immediately shift the capital to New Delhi. Five Zonal Councils were set up vide Part-III of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956.\n\nQuestion: seven union territories of india and their capital\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As the firebox gets hotter, the network of steel pipes that pass around the cooker produce hot water. Due to environmental concerns, trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is being considered as an alternative. After fire suppression, the halon diffuses, leaving no residue.

Health problems associated with dental fluorosis may occur when fluoride concentrations in groundwater exceed 1.5 mg/l, which is the WHO guideline value since 1984. It is also present in human teeth that have been exposed to fluoride ions, for example, through water fluoridation or by using fluoride-containing toothpaste. The presence of fluorapatite helps prevent tooth decay or dental caries. Fluoroapatite has a critical pH of 4.5, thus it makes tooth structure more resistant to additional caries attack. It has a mild bacteriostatic property as well, which helps decrease the proliferation of Streptococcus mutans, the predominant bacterium related to dental caries. At the urging of Dr. Frederick McKay and others concerned with the brown-staining of teeth in certain regions of the country, Dean was asked to make this his first assignment at the Institute in 1931. Dean was part of a team that focused on determining optimal concentrations of fluoride in drinking water that would only cause minimal and mild mottled enamel on the teeth (dental fluorosis), while at the same time precipitating lower rates of dental caries (cavities). In 1934, as part of this work, Dean published an index to categorize the severity of dental fluorosis. In 1939 he reported on children who grew up in 4 nearby Illinois towns: Overall caries in the low fluoride towns were 2-3 times the caries in high fluoride towns. The greatest difference was in cavities between \n\n  In the earth's crust, fluoride is the 13th most abundant element. The fluoride acts as a hardening agent with the enamel base on teeth, remineralizing and protecting them from harsh acids and bacteria in the oral cavity.

Overall, these advancements will help towards making fluoride and future drugs strong protectors against oral health disease.\n\nQuestion: where is the highest level of fluoride stored in the teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ganglion cells vary much in size, and the dendrites of the smaller ones as a rule arborize in the inner plexiform layer as soon as they enter it; while those of the larger cells ramify close to the inner nuclear layer. Through the rat optic nerve, early research made significant contributions to knowledge in the field of myelinogenesis. The numbers of axonal telodendria (the branching structures at the end of the axon) can also differ from one nerve fiber to the next. Axon dysfunction \n\n Axons are the primary transmission lines of the nervous system, and as bundles they form nerves. Some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter. The longest axons in the human body are those of the sciatic nerve, which run from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe of each foot. The diameter of axons is also variable. Most individual axons are microscopic in diameter (typically about one micrometer (µm) across).\n\nQuestion: ganglion axons forming the optic nerve run to the\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Delaware's state flower has been the peach blossom since 1995, and peach pie became its official dessert in 2009. In 2018, world production of peaches (combined with nectarines for reporting) was 24.5 million tonnes, led by China with 62% of the world total (table). The U.S. state of Georgia is known as the \"Peach State\" due to its significant production of peaches as early as 1571, with exports to other states occurring around 1858. In 2014, Georgia was third in US peach production behind California and South Carolina. The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. It bears edible juicy fruits with various characteristics, most called peaches and others (the glossy-skinned, non-fuzzy varieties), nectarines. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, \n\n  Although its botanical name Prunus persica refers to Persia, genetic studies suggest peaches originated in China, where they have been cultivated since the neolithic period. Archaeologists point to the Yangtze River Valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties probably took place.

However, Lead is toxic and is a possible carcinogen. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm). In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that approximately 35 percent of U.S. homes (37 million) still contain some lead-based paint, a decline from 1990 estimate of 64 million homes with lead paint. and trichloroethylene that had been called for by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. According to the EPA, lead poisoning is the number one environmental health threat in the U.S. for children ages 6 and younger. The Court called the lead paint risks for children \"severe\". Lead, which was used in gasoline until 1995 and paint until 1978, is known to damage the nervous system in various ways. A few studies have found that people with high levels of lead in their body had twice the risk of Parkinson's disease. The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint.\n\nQuestion: when did they stop putting lead in paint\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act (Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195), which set stringent regulations on industry. Boyd Redner writes in A History of The Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Institute: “The National Industrial Recovery Act spelled out provisions to businessmen … every industry was to come under a code, and the code had two sets of regulations … [1.] The Chamber of Commerce and other conservative groups provided enthusiastic support. The original draft of the act grew out of the so-called Gerard Swope plan for Recovery.\" On June 16, 1933, President Franklin D.

The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. Its primary role is to receive the blood from the body, pump it to the lungs to be oxygenated, and receive it once more to pump it again to the rest of the human body tissues. Therefore, one could just as well say that venous return is determined by the mean aortic pressure minus the mean right atrial pressure, divided by the resistance of the entire systemic circulation (i.e., the systemic vascular resistance). It is often suggested that venous return dictates cardiac output, effected through the Frank Starling mechanism. However, as noted above it is clear that, equally, cardiac output must dictate venous \n\n Venous return (VR) is the flow of blood back to the heart.

Under the revised system, contributions paid in equal share by employer and employee were expected to be equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system. In 1990 some 90% of companies paid retirement benefits to their employees in the form of lump-sum payments and pensions.

Paraguay is bounded by Bolivia to the northwest and north, Brazil to the northeast and east, and Argentina to the southeast, south, and west. The Paraguay River, which runs from north to south, divides Paraguay into two distinct geographic regions—the Región Oriental (Eastern Region) and the Región Occidental (Western Region), also called the Chaco Boreal. It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paraná flooded savanna along the lower Paraná and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers. Crossing the departments of Central, Cordillera, Caaguazu and Alto Paraná. Triángulo Dionisio Foianini (Dionisio Foianini Triangle) is the name given to Bolivia's border with Brazil and Paraguay. Its importance lies in the fact that this border is marked in part by the Paraguay River and, as a result, Bolivia has a water route to the Atlantic Ocean that does not involve Brazil. Currently Bolivian ships must pass along the eleven kilometre Tamengo Canal which connects Laguna Cáceres to the Paraguay River at the Brazilian city of Corumbá. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm3/sec (2,530 cub. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km2 (9,382 square miles).\n\nQuestion: where does the paraguay river start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Though Bonhomme Richard sank after the battle, the battle's outcome was one of the factors that convinced the French crown to back the colonies in their fight to become independent of British authority. The French invasion of Saint Kitts also known as the Siege of Brimstone Hill, from 19 January–13 February 1782, was a part of the American Revolutionary War. After landing on Saint Kitts, the French troops of the Marquis de Bouillé stormed and besieged the fortress of Brimstone Hill. The Comte de Grasse, who delivered de Bouillé's troops and supported the siege, was outmanoeuvred and deprived of his anchorage by Admiral Samuel Hood. Hood's attempts to relieve the ongoing siege were unsuccessful, and the garrison capitulated after one month. An eyewitness stated that he saw the arms of French troopers cut off cleanly \"like Berlin sausages.\" Other French soldiers were killed by blows to the head, blows which divided the head down to the chin.

The Ohio River drains portions of eight states, including, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. About 850 miles of the river is navigable, from Minneapolis-St. Paul to the Ohio River. The river runs approximately 273 miles (439 km) long, in the U.S. state of Illinois. This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The Illinois River meets the Mississippi at Pere Marquette State Park, which is near Grafton. The Illinois River is relatively shallow, just like the Mississippi. In addition, the Illinois River is a \"managed\" river, just as the Mississippi River is. The Mississippi River is the largest drainage basin in the United States. From the perspective of natural geography and hydrology, the system consists of the Mississippi River itself and its numerous natural tributaries and distributaries. The major tributaries are the Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Red rivers. Given their flow volumes, major Ohio River tributaries like the Allegheny, Tennessee, and Wabash rivers are considered important tributaries to the Mississippi \n\n The Allegheny River is a 325 mi long headwater stream of the Ohio River in western Pennsylvania and New York, United States.

For these reasons, the opinions of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously. Events in the main sequence of the Odyssey (excluding the narrative of Odysseus's adventures) take place in the Peloponnese and in what are now called the Ionian Islands (Ithaca and its neighbours). However, scholars both ancient and modern are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after Ismaros and before his return to Ithaca) were real. The geographer Strabo and many others came down squarely on the skeptical side: he reported what the great geographer Eratosthenes had said in the late 3rd century BC: \"You will find the scene of Odysseus's wanderings when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds.\" a separate itinerary to the sequence that ended with the Laestrygonians and was possibly derived from the stories of the Argonauts. He placed many of the later episodes on the north west Greek coast, near the Acheron. Along the way he found on the map Cape Skilla (at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf) and other names that implied traditional links with the Odyssey. land of the Cyclopes = Sicily ; land of the Laestrygonians = Sicily ; island of Aeolus = one or more of the Aeolian Islands off Sicily's north coast ; Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians = Corcyra (modern Corfu), off the west coast of Greece and Albania ; Ogygia, the island home of the nymph Calypso = Gaulos, modern Gozo, part of the Maltese archipelago.

If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, \"roll clouds\" and tornadoes may occur. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted. It is  normally accompanied by heavy precipitation.

The answer in both cases is that the points are virtual; they do not physically exist. Optical spaces are divided into real and virtual parts. The situation is reversed for image points.

The shoe typically costs $250 in the U.S at launch. The Adidas_1 was a running shoe made by German multinational corporation Adidas, introduced in early 2005. It was the second general consumer sneaker to incorporate a computer (the Adidas 'Micropacer' had been the first in 1984). The shoe was ahead of its time and a brand statement quickly followed by the introduction of an improved generation shortly after the release of the original shoes, which was called Intelligence Level 1.1. The shoe was later discontinued and later followed by the Adidas_1 basketball shoe, introduced in 2006. Responding to an anti-sneaker rap song by Jerrald Deas called \"Felon Sneakers\", the trio released a song of their own called \"My Adidas\" in 1986. The song paid tribute to the Superstar shoe, and attempted to flip the stereotype of the 'b-boy'. and Adidas was the first endorsement deal between hip-hop artists and a major corporation, and a Run-D.M.C.

Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, and John Candy. Cool Runnings was released in the United States on October 1, 1993 to generally positive reviews. It wasn't funny enough, the key elements were lacking, and it just wasn't working. Leon, Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba have all confirmed in their interview with Empire that it was originally meant to have been a serious sports drama film. The film's working title was Blue Maaga. Before Jon Turteltaub was officially hired, Jeremiah S. Chechik was slated to direct until he moved on to do Benny & Joon (1993) instead. Brian Gibson was also considered to direct, but he dropped out to do What's Love Got to Do with It (1993) instead. Turteltaub used the actual ABC sports footage from the 1988 Olympics and incorporated it into the film.

Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA. Wilkins, Crick, and Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\". The first reports of a double helix molecular model of B-DNA structure were made by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. Through Max Perutz, his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King's College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helical structure in a paper in the journal Nature in April 1953. The first high quality X-ray diffraction patterns of A-DNA were reported by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in 1953. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center.\n\nQuestion: who proposed the first accurate model of dna\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The poem tells of a battered old violin that is about to be sold as the last item at an auction for a pittance, until a violinist steps out of the audience and plays the instrument, demonstrating its beauty and true value. The poem ends by comparing this instrument touched by the hand of a master musician to the life of a sinner that is touched by the hand of God. Welch's famous poem inspired other works. Contemporary Christian artist Wayne Watson recorded a song by the same name, with lyrics adapted to the music based on this poem. The song was written by John Kramp in 1974 while a freshman at Baylor University and recorded for Wayne Waston's first album Workin' In The Final Hour in 1980 and recorded 12 years later on his How Time Flies compilation project. Melissa Etheridge wrote the song after the initial version of her debut album was rejected by the recording company, which left her only four days to provide new material and a modified edition of the album.

The decrease in current triggers a fire alarm. Americium is used in the most common type of household smoke detector, which uses 241Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 microcurie (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms. Because of this, haze is far less likely to set off fire alarms than fog machines or larger smoke particles. Fire alarms– Fire alarms monitors the environmental changes associated with combustion. Once the alarm has been triggered by fire or smoke, a loud sound emanates to warn of danger and sends a message to a central monitoring center, which then notifies the local fire department. Heat detectors – \n\n Americium-241, an alpha emitter, is used in smoke detectors.

It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature. Romanticism has been seen as \"the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages\", reaching beyond rational and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant. The name \"Romanticism\" itself was derived from the medieval genre chivalric romance. This movement contributed to the strong influence of such romances, disproportionate to their actual \n\n The British Romantic movement of the early nineteenth century introduced new aesthetic ideas to literary studies, including the idea that the object of literature need not always be beautiful, noble, or perfect, but that literature itself could elevate a common subject to the level of the sublime. The Romantic interest in the medieval can particularly be seen in the illustrations of English poet William Blake and the Ossian cycle published by Scottish poet James Macpherson in 1762, which inspired both Goethe's Götz von Berlichingen (1773), and the young Walter Scott. The latter's Waverley Novels, including Ivanhoe (1819) and Quentin Durward (1823) helped popularise, and shape views of, the medieval era. the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a \"culture\" among non-elites. The era occurred during the early to mid 19th century primarily at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique of the Paris Opera Ballet and Her Majesty's Theatre in London.\n\nQuestion: when did the romanticism period start and end\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The crash was the fastest fall in global stock markets in financial history and the most devastating crash since the Wall Street Crash of 1929. A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles. There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale.

In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government. It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution; a \"rulebook\" for how the new nation should function.

To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the \"custom of nations\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. Rhode Island was the final state to ratify the Constitution in 1790, the first ten amendments were ratified in 1791 and became known as the United States Bill of Rights. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England pioneered some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.

Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth. If the infant is not closing down properly, the lower jaws become more noticeably deficient (micrognathia or retrognathia). This condition is called an anterior open bite and has facial/skeletal implications. teeth as they line up in the mouth. This may cause the upper front teeth to flare out and become more prone to fracture if accidentally hit. Appliances that expand the upper arch tend to bring the front teeth back into a more-normal position. Lack of a good oral seal (lips together) allows the gingiva (gums) to get dry and may get inflamed and irritated. In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth). It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. Diastema is sometimes caused or exacerbated by the action of a labial frenulum (the tissue connecting the lip to the gum), causing high mucosal attachment and less attached keratinized tissue. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of the gap between two front teeth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Burundian crisis was significantly neglected during the summit, however, Yoweri Museveni the new chairman of the member bloc vowed to quickly find a solution to the crisis. the struggle against the heavily dominated Arabicized Sudanese Government, which was achieved in 2005. Following the independence of South Sudan in 2011, Algeria soon recognized the independence of South Sudan from Sudan. Recently Algeria had shown deep concerns to South Sudan crisis and urged for mediations between two nations as part of African Union's peace plan. Algeria had also supported a peacekeeping mission from Japan to South Sudan. During a visit in South Sudan in February 2017, Moroccan king Mohammed VI intended to demonstrate how the Algeria-South Africa block feeding secessionist movements in Africa, including the Polisario Front, had failed. The exiled SANU leaders did not accept Deng's moderate approach, and formed the Azania Liberation Front in Kampala, Uganda. He finally broke with the exile groups in 1971 due to disagreement with Joseph Lagu, commander of the Anyanya guerrilla fighters, who wanted to subordinate the political wing of the movement to the military wing. A South African Government statement gave the reason for the recall of its troops as: \"The Sudanese government made it increasingly difficult for us to provide logistic support to our troops, and impossible for our forces to protect the women and children of that country\". South Africa withdrew their troops from UNAMID from 1 April 2016 after nearly 12 years of deployments to Darfur.

In practice, the Speaker is usually a member of the governing party or parties, who have the majority in the House. The Speaker continues to be a member of his or her political party, but it is left to their individual discretion as to whether or not they attend party meetings.

Before the party, as Fowler was checking to make sure everything would be ready for the 300 invited guests, found Lillian sweeping the decks and assisted her.

Initially, these plans included a park similar to Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios), to be called Disney Hollywood Studio Theme Park at Tokyo Disneyland. During the creation of the park, the United States and Japan had to compromise on certain design elements of the park due to cultural differences, such as the park's entrance focal point. Her instructions from her boss were to ask Walt Disney if there was truth to the rumors that he was behind the land purchase in central Florida.
