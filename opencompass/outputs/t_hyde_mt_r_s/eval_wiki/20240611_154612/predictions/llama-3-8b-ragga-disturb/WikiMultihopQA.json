This estate had been recently occupied by Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, her maternal grandmother. On 22 February 1848 Karoline Amalie died in the Winter Palace aged 76, after suffering from a chest illness as the Privilegirte Gothaische newspaper reported on the same day. On New Year's Day 1811 she died in Schloss Kirchheim after long suffering from endometrial cancer. Five days later she was buried in the choir of the Martinskirche in Kirchheim, contrary to her wish to be buried beside Charles Eugene in Ludwigsburg. In 1906 the württembergischen Geschichts- und Altertumsverein placed a marble relief of her on the south wall of the choir and in 1962 her remains were reburied in a new oak coffin. She died a few days later in Neustrelitz.

Emperor Wilhelm II and Empress Augusta Victoria attended her funeral, which was held at the castle where she died. They were buried in the Mausoleum auf dem Hutberge in the park of Schloss Kamenz/Silesia. After World War II, the mausoleum was plundered and they were reburied in the park. On 19 May 1891 Reusch premiered a famous statue of Albert at Königsberg Castle with the inscription: \"Albert of Brandenburg, Last Grand Master, First Duke in Prussia\". King's Gate contains a statue of Albert. Albert was oft-honored in the quarter Maraunenhof in northern Königsberg. Its town square, König-Ottokar-Platz, was renamed Herzog-Albrecht-Platz in 1934 to match its church, the Herzog-Albrecht-Gedächtniskirche. According to some sources Pauline died at the home of a mayor who had housed the family temporarily; according to others, she died on the Freienwalde, one of the royal Prussian possessions west of Berlin near the Oder. This estate had been recently occupied by Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, her maternal grandmother. Pauline was definitely buried on the Freienwalde estate. A monument by sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow was put in place only in 1813. The neglected grave was rediscovered by the new owner of Freienwalde, Walther Rathenau in 1909. The princess grew up with her sisters in Königsberg Castle.

Emperor Wilhelm II and Empress Augusta Victoria attended her funeral, which was held at the castle where she died. They were buried in the Mausoleum auf dem Hutberge in the park of Schloss Kamenz/Silesia. After World War II, the mausoleum was plundered and they were reburied in the park. On 19 May 1891 Reusch premiered a famous statue of Albert at Königsberg Castle with the inscription: \"Albert of Brandenburg, Last Grand Master, First Duke in Prussia\". King's Gate contains a statue of Albert. Albert was oft-honored in the quarter Maraunenhof in northern Königsberg. Its town square, König-Ottokar-Platz, was renamed Herzog-Albrecht-Platz in 1934 to match its church, the Herzog-Albrecht-Gedächtniskirche. According to some sources Pauline died at the home of a mayor who had housed the family temporarily; according to others, she died on the Freienwalde, one of the royal Prussian possessions west of Berlin near the Oder. This estate had been recently occupied by Princess Frederika Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, her maternal grandmother. Pauline was definitely buried on the Freienwalde estate. A monument by sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow was put in place only in 1813. The neglected grave was rediscovered by the new owner of Freienwalde, Walther Rathenau in 1909. The princess grew up with her sisters in Königsberg Castle. Marie died in 1649 and was buried in the City Church in Bayreuth; she had donated the high altar in this church.\n\n"

He was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church at Saint Sophia Cathedral, London, on 10 July 1986, with King Juan Carlos I of Spain, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Diana, Princess of Wales, Infanta Elena of Spain, Princess Benedikte of Denmark, Kyril, Prince of Preslav and Penelope, Lady Romsey serving as godparents. He would also comment that, allegations to the contrary notwithstanding, his uncle's notorious relationship with his assistant Monique Friesz in his later years, during which substantial assets were presumed to have been consumed or diverted, did not reflect manipulation on her part so much as the desire of the Comte de Paris for companionship when he chose to isolate himself from the society, culture and luxury to which he had previously been accustomed. He is the last surviving grandchild of George I of Greece and one of the 2 last surviving great-grandchildren of Christian IX of Denmark (the other is his second cousin Christian Castenskiold, son of Princess Dagmar of Denmark). He was buried in the cathedral of Trani. Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark (Φίλιππος; born 26 April 1986) is the youngest child of Constantine II and Anne-Marie of Denmark, who were the last King and Queen of Greece, reigning from 1964 to 1973.\n\n"

Werner (born January 17, 1947 in New York City, New York) is an American film and television director. Peter Patzak (2 January 1945 – 11 March 2021) was an Austrian film director and screenwriter. His film Kassbach – Ein Porträt was entered into the 29th Berlin International Film Festival and his film Wahnfried was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. His 1997 film Shanghai 1937 was entered into the 20th Moscow International Film Festival. Peter was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1938. His father Andras Peter (1903–1944), an esteemed art historian and third-generation Catholic who was fond of England, was killed by Hungarian Nazis in 1944 because of his Jewish ancestry. Prasnovsky became an alcoholic, and Peter and his mother eventually left to live with friends in Budapest. He was born in Norbiton, Surrey, lived in Sweden, Canada and Lithuania for many years, and now lives in France. Nearly all of Watkins' films have used a combination of dramatic and documentary elements to dissect historical occurrences or possible near future events. The first of these, Culloden, portrayed the Jacobite uprising of 1745 in a documentary style, as if television reporters were interviewing the participants and accompanying them into battle; a similar device was used in his biographical film Edvard Munch.\n\n"

Edward governed well and powerfully, despite the conditions against him. However, Edward's early death in 1553 led to the accession of Henry's daughter Mary I. She returned England to Roman Catholicis, burning at the stake some 300 Protestants as heretics and forcing others into exile. He was the only son of Sir George Darrell of Littlecote (died 1474), Keeper of the Great Wardrobe to King Edward IV,  and his second wife Joan Haute, daughter of William Haute. His father died when Edward was eight years old, and he succeeded to very substantial estates, the \n\n II of Jülich, and the Heerkeren faction supporting their half-sister Mathilde, wife of Count John II of Blois. Edward was betrothed in 1368 to Katherine of Bavaria (30 May 1361 – 10 November 1400, buried Kloster Monkhuizen), daughter of Albert I, Duke of Bavaria and Margaret of Brieg. Edward died when she was only 10 years old and Katherine subsequently married in 1379 to Edward's nephew, William of Jülich. The title was first assumed in 1340 by Edward III of England, the Kingdom of England being ruled by the Plantagenet dynasty at the time. At the time of Charles IV's death in 1328, Edward was his nearest male relative through Edward's mother Isabella of France.\n\n"
