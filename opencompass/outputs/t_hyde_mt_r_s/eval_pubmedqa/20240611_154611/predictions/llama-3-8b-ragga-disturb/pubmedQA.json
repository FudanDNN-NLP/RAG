One hypothesis is that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism significantly influences the epidemiology of MS. Two opposing versions of this hypothesis include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis, the former being more favored. Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of \n\n bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. There are several diseases that present similarly to multiple sclerosis. The symptoms of MS are largely immune mediated, but the mechanism of the immune system's initiation in this disease is unknown. It is likely that both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in the initiation and progression of the disease. One hypothesis for the initiation is that an infection stimulates the innate immune system, specifically perivascular microglia.

        "context": " Many microbes have been proposed as triggers of MS, but none has been confirmed. One hypothesis is that infection by a widespread microbe contributes to disease development, and the geographic distribution of this organism significantly influences the epidemiology of MS. Two opposing versions of this hypothesis include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis, the former being more favored. Evidence for a virus as a cause include the presence of \n\n bands in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. There are several diseases that present similarly to multiple sclerosis. The symptoms of MS are largely immune mediated, but the mechanism of the immune system's initiation in this disease is unknown. It is likely that both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in the initiation and progression of the disease. One hypothesis for the initiation is that an infection stimulates the innate immune system, specifically perivascular microglia. This allows the entrance of T-cells, and microglia spread viral epitopes, along with myelin epitopes, to T cells, \n\n Smoking may be an independent risk factor for MS.

The cells of these tumors have a growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity. This growth factor receptor is called c-kit and is produced by a proto-oncogene (c-kit). However, three medications have been identified for clinical benefit in GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec), an orally administered drug initially marketed for chronic myelogenous leukemia based on bcr-abl inhibition, also inhibits both c-kit tyrosine kinase mutations and PDGFRA mutations other than D842V, is useful in treating GISTs in several situations. Imatinib has been used in selected neoadjuvant settings. In the adjuvant treatment setting, the majority of GIST tumors are cured by surgery, and do not need adjuvant therapy. An exception to this \n\nKIT-D816V point mutations in c-KIT exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. c-KIT is a gene that encodes for a transmembrane receptor for a growth factor termed stem cell factor (scf). In the gut, however, a \n\n imatinib is encountered, the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib (marketed as Sutent) can be considered. The effectiveness of imatinib and sunitinib depend on the genotype. A specific subtype of PDGFRA-mutation, D842V, is also insensitive to imatinib.

        "context": "However, tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (imatinib) is effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The cells of these tumors have a growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity. This growth factor receptor is called c-kit and is produced by a proto-oncogene (c-kit). However, three medications have been identified for clinical benefit in GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. Imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec), an orally administered drug initially marketed for chronic myelogenous leukemia based on bcr-abl inhibition, also inhibits both c-kit tyrosine kinase mutations and PDGFRA mutations other than D842V, is useful in treating GISTs in several situations. Imatinib has been used in selected neoadjuvant settings. In the adjuvant treatment setting, the majority of GIST tumors are cured by surgery, and do not need adjuvant therapy. An exception to this \n\nKIT-D816V point mutations in c-KIT exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. c-KIT is a gene that encodes for a transmembrane receptor for a growth factor termed stem cell factor (scf). In the gut, however, a \n\n imatinib is encountered, the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib (marketed as Sutent) can be considered. The effectiveness of imatinib and sunitinib depend on the genotype. A specific subtype of PDGFRA-mutation, D842V, is also insensitive to imatinib. Now there is real world data coming for avapritinib as well (Dr Sameer Rastogi et al) Regorafenib (Stivarga) was FDA approved in 2013 for advanced GISTs that cannot be surgically removed and that no longer respond to imatinib (Gleevec) and sunitinib (Sutent).

Minority patients, when compared to non-minority patients, were not as likely to be appropriately evaluated for their pain and reported less pain relief. 2004, a multi-site study determined that persons with persistent asthma per the HEDIS definition at the time had more \"asthma-related adverse events\" if they were classified by HEDIS as having appropriate asthma therapy than if they did not have appropriate therapy. ; A 2008 study of 1056 adults with asthma found that \"compliance with the HEDIS asthma measure is not favorably associated with relevant patient-oriented outcomes\" such as scores on an Asthma Control Test. For example, they suffer higher rates of morbidity due to stroke, perinatal disease, and diabetes mellitus compared to Whites. Distal stressors have been linked to these health disparities among African Americans. Compared to Caucasian patients, African American and Hispanic patients are particularly at risk for being undertreated for pain. There are a variety of conditions for which African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities experience continuous undertreatment, including cancer pain, acute postoperative pain, chest pain, acute pain, and chronic low back pain. A study examining over 1300 non-minority and minority patients discovered that those at facilities with principally minority patients were three times more likely to be undermedicated than patients treated in\n\n"

American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and the person's preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. A gradual loss of therapeutic benefit occurs in a minority of people during the course of treatment. A strategy involving the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode, followed by psychotherapy in its residual phase, has been suggested by some studies. For patients who wish to stop their antidepressants, engaging in brief psychological interventions such as Preventive Cognitive Therapy or Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy while tapering down has been found to diminish the risk for relapse. Those groups were tested for many things including cortisol levels, depressive symptomatology, and stress reactivity levels. There were no large differences between consumers of self-help books and nonconsumers when it comes to diurnal cortisol level, there was a large difference in depressive symptomatology with consumers having a higher mean score. However, the problem-focused group shows higher depressive symptomatology. Recommendations for psychological treatments or combination treatments in preventing recurrence are not clear.\n\n"

        "context": " Treatment is control of the blood pressure, often with continuous intravenous antihypertensives medicines in the intensive care setting. Other signs provide evidence for specific causes of pressure overload. Hypertension is diagnosed by sphygmomanometry. Pulmonary hypertension is also associated with chronic lung disease. Coarctation of the aorta presents with a significant difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs, a systolic murmur or radiofemoral delay. Additionally, the prevalence of certain disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia is increased in premenopausal women and can lead to secondary hypertension. This was often successful in reducing blood pressure but due to its non-selective nature the side effects of the procedure were poorly tolerated. Modern antihypertensive pharmacological interventions have improved the control of hypertension, but only 34-66% of people with hypertension in England, USA and Canada have blood pressure at or below target levels. Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above target (140/90mm Hg) despite concomitant use of 3 or more anti-hypertensives – one of which should be a diuretic. It has been estimated that 8-10% of people with hypertension fall into this category.\n\n"

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX\n\n The success of vaccines in preventing major outbreaks relies on the mechanism of herd immunity, also known as community immunity, where the immunization of individuals provides protection for not only the individuals, but also the community at large. Often however these vaccine programmes require the immunization of a large majority of the population to provide herd immunity. A few successful vaccine programmes have led to the eradication of infectious diseases like small pox and rinderpest, and the near eradication of polio, which plagued the world before the second half of the 20th century.\n\n"

Exceptions may include pregnant women, those who have had a recent kidney transplant, young children with significant vesicoureteral reflux, and those undergoing surgery of the urinary tract. Bacteria can ascend into the bladder or kidney and causing cystitis and nephritis. These pathogenic species are usually distinct from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal gut flora. But a different strain of the same species may be pathogenic. The distinction is sometimes difficult as in the case of Escherichia.\n\n"

There is a slight increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior when taken by children, adolescents, and young adults. Evidence of benefit in children and adolescents is unclear. Furthermore, lithium dramatically decreases the suicide risk in recurrent depression. Psychopharmacologists have also tried adding a stimulant, in particular, d-amphetamine. However, the use of stimulants in cases of treatment-resistant depression is relatively controversial.\n\n"

The rationale for this rule change offered by World Rugby is that \"forcing players to tackle lower may reduce the risk of head injuries to both the tackler and tackled player,\" as well as encouraging more offloads and expansive play. Initial trials of this rule change from the Fédération Française de Rugby (FFR) has had positive results, showing that reduction of permissible tackling to waist height reduces the number of head impacts and player injuries.\n\n"

A simple diagram can be drawn of ABA inhibits seed germination, while gibberellin (GA, also plant hormone) inhibits ABA production and promotes seed germination. cutin biosynthesis ; surface wax formation ; mitochondrial growth ; adaptation to environmental changes ; lipid metabolism ; fertilization of flowering plants ; adaptation of plants under stress conditions ; activation and regulation of signaling cascades ; apoptosis ; symbiosis ; fruit ripening Ordinarily, most lipids do not spontaneously exit membranes because their hydrophobicity makes them poorly soluble in water. It is a survival strategy exhibited by many plant species, which enables them to survive in climates where part of the year is unsuitable for growth, such as winter or dry seasons. Many plant species that exhibit dormancy have a biological clock that tells them when to slow activity and to prepare soft tissues for a period of freezing temperatures or water shortage. On the other hand, dormancy can be triggered after a normal growing season by decreasing temperatures, shortened day length, and/or a reduction in rainfall. Chemical treatment on dormant plants has been proven to be an effective method\n\n"

Quantification of the maximum velocity through the valve, the area of the opening of the valve, calcification, morphology (tricuspid, bicuspid, unicuspid), and size of the valve (annulus, sinuses, sinotubular junction) are common parameters when evaluating the aortic valve. Invasive measurement of the aortic valve can be done during a cardiac catheterization in which the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta can be measured simultaneously. In mild aortic stenosis, the crescendo-decrescendo is early peaking whereas in severe aortic stenosis, the crescendo is late-peaking, and the S2 heart sound may be obliterated. Stenosis of Bicuspid aortic valve is similar to the aortic valve stenosis heart murmur, but a systolic ejection click may be heard after S1 in calcified bicuspid aortic valves. Individuals with severe aortic stenosis are candidates for aortic valve replacement once they develop symptoms or when their heart function is impacted.

        "context": "Diagnosis of aortic stenosis is contingent upon quantification of this gradient. Quantification of the maximum velocity through the valve, the area of the opening of the valve, calcification, morphology (tricuspid, bicuspid, unicuspid), and size of the valve (annulus, sinuses, sinotubular junction) are common parameters when evaluating the aortic valve. Invasive measurement of the aortic valve can be done during a cardiac catheterization in which the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta can be measured simultaneously. In mild aortic stenosis, the crescendo-decrescendo is early peaking whereas in severe aortic stenosis, the crescendo is late-peaking, and the S2 heart sound may be obliterated. Stenosis of Bicuspid aortic valve is similar to the aortic valve stenosis heart murmur, but a systolic ejection click may be heard after S1 in calcified bicuspid aortic valves. Individuals with severe aortic stenosis are candidates for aortic valve replacement once they develop symptoms or when their heart function is impacted. Some people with asymptomatic aortic stenosis may also be candidates for aortic valve replacement, especially if symptoms appear during exercise testing.

Gender— approximately twice as common in women than men, usually in seventh and eighth decades ; Obesity ; Chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis ; Primary sclerosing cholangitis ; Chronic typhoid infection of gallbladder; chronic Salmonella typhi carriers have 3 to 200 times higher risk of gallbladder cancer than non-carriers and 1–6% lifetime risk of development of cancer ; Various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with gallbladder cancer; however, existing genetic studies in GBC susceptibility have so far been insufficient to confirm any association ; Gallbladder polyps ; Calcified gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder) ; Congenital abnormalities of the bile duct such as choledochal cyst \n\n The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance provides women with resources to track their symptoms for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The Symptom Diary, developed by the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and the Gynecologic Cancer Foundation, can be used to track persistency of symptoms over time that may indicate the possibility of ovarian cancer. Completing this diary will help women document their concerns and assist their doctor in determining next steps. The Practice Guidance outlines important steps the patient’s doctor may take to evaluate whether the symptoms may be ovarian cancer. Leaders in ovarian cancer research, diagnosis and treatment have developed these symptom management strategies based\n\n"

The 21-member joint \n\n   Fluoroquinolones are often used for genitourinary infections and are widely used in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections associated with urinary catheters. Due to people with sickle-cell disease being at increased risk for developing osteomyelitis from the Salmonella, fluoroquinolones are the \"drugs of choice\" due to their ability to enter bone tissue without chelating it, as tetracyclines are known to do. Fluoroquinolones are featured prominently in guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Symptomatic bacteriuria is synonymous with urinary tract infection and typically treated with antibiotics. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. In February 2011, the risk of worsening symptoms for those with myasthenia gravis was added to the warning.\n\n"

Augmented renal clearance can be caused by increased fluid administration, certain medications, and critical illnesses. Many medications require adjustment to account for the changed clearance in people with ARC, notably some antibiotics. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Augmented renal clearance may result in failure of treatment due to the increased elimination of drugs. This can be prevented by increasing the dosage of the medication, or by increasing the frequency the medication is administered to account for increased elimination. ARC influences the recommended dosages for antibiotics including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and vancomycin in critical care. In any case, the occurrence of ARC is managed through pharmacokinetic monitoring and adjusting medication dosages, frequencies, or timing to ensure adequate response.

        "context": " In pharmacology, augmented renal clearance (ARC) is a phenomenon where certain critically ill patients may display increased clearance of a medication through the kidneys. Augmented renal clearance can be caused by increased fluid administration, certain medications, and critical illnesses. Many medications require adjustment to account for the changed clearance in people with ARC, notably some antibiotics. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Augmented renal clearance may result in failure of treatment due to the increased elimination of drugs. This can be prevented by increasing the dosage of the medication, or by increasing the frequency the medication is administered to account for increased elimination. ARC influences the recommended dosages for antibiotics including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and vancomycin in critical care. In any case, the occurrence of ARC is managed through pharmacokinetic monitoring and adjusting medication dosages, frequencies, or timing to ensure adequate response.

About 10% of those discharged from hospital are readmitted due to underlying co-morbidities such as heart, lung, or neurological disorders, or due to new onset of pneumonia. Complications may occur in particular in the elderly and those with underlying health problems. This may include, among others: empyema, lung abscess, bronchiolitis obliterans, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and worsening of underlying health problems. In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases. The diagnosis of influenza-like illness can be made based on the signs and symptoms; however, confirmation of an influenza infection requires testing. Thus, treatment is frequently based on the presence of influenza in the community or a rapid influenza test. A chest radiograph is frequently used in diagnosis. In people with mild disease, imaging is needed only in those with potential complications, those not having improved with treatment, or those in which the cause is uncertain.

Complications may occur in particular in the elderly and those with underlying health problems. This may include, among others: empyema, lung abscess, bronchiolitis obliterans, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and worsening of underlying health problems. In general, in adults, investigations are not needed in mild cases. The diagnosis of influenza-like illness can be made based on the signs and symptoms; however, confirmation of an influenza infection requires testing. Thus, treatment is frequently based on the presence of influenza in the community or a rapid influenza test. A chest radiograph is frequently used in diagnosis.

Similar to hospice care, this area of healthcare philosophy is becoming increasingly important as more patients prefer to receive healthcare services in their homes. As a patient nears the end of his life, it is more comforting to be in a private home-like setting instead of a hospital. However, it is now being applied to patients in all kinds of medical situations, including chronic fatigue and other distressing symptoms.

When someone has an estimated death date and a death trajectory, the patient's caregivers generally cease curative care and proceed to provide palliative or comfort care. Complementary therapies are often used in palliative care or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. \"From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life.

Frequent presentation without prominent respiratory symptoms in children who do not appear to have ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection but who have already developed antibodies suggests that the disease may be driven by a delayed, post-infectious mechanism. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. After organ transplantation or in otherwise immunocompromised persons, there are high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia.

Frequent presentation without prominent respiratory symptoms in children who do not appear to have ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection but who have already developed antibodies suggests that the disease may be driven by a delayed, post-infectious mechanism. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. After organ transplantation or in otherwise immunocompromised persons, there are high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia.
