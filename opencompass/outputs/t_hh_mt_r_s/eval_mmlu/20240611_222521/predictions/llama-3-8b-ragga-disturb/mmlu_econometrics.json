Model complexity refers to the number of parameters or variables included in the model, while data fit refers to how well the model matches the observed data. It penalizes models with more complex structures by adding a penalty term proportional to the number of parameters used. This penalty discourages overfitting, which occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than true patterns. The lower the AIC value, the better the trade-off between complexity and fit, indicating a more favorable model. It helps researchers choose models that are both parsimonious and accurate, striking an appropriate balance between these two aspects. One such issue is model selection, where different models may need to be compared to determine which one best fits the observed data. Another inference issue in compartmental models is model complexity. The Bayesian framework naturally penalizes complex models, avoiding overfitting and promoting model parsimony. This is achieved through the use of prior distributions, which express beliefs about the model parameters before considering the data. By specifying appropriate priors, researchers can control the complexity of the models and ensure that the inference process is not overly influenced by noise or irrelevant features. By assigning prior distributions to the model parameters, Bayesian inference allows for the estimation of posterior distributions for these parameters. They allow for model selection, model complexity control, and model comparison, helping to make more informed and evidence-based decisions in modeling neuronal behavior.

        "context": "Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is a statistical measure that evaluates the goodness of fit of an estimated model. Model complexity refers to the number of parameters or variables included in the model, while data fit refers to how well the model matches the observed data. It penalizes models with more complex structures by adding a penalty term proportional to the number of parameters used. This penalty discourages overfitting, which occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than true patterns. The lower the AIC value, the better the trade-off between complexity and fit, indicating a more favorable model. It helps researchers choose models that are both parsimonious and accurate, striking an appropriate balance between these two aspects. One such issue is model selection, where different models may need to be compared to determine which one best fits the observed data. Another inference issue in compartmental models is model complexity. The Bayesian framework naturally penalizes complex models, avoiding overfitting and promoting model parsimony. This is achieved through the use of prior distributions, which express beliefs about the model parameters before considering the data. By specifying appropriate priors, researchers can control the complexity of the models and ensure that the inference process is not overly influenced by noise or irrelevant features. By assigning prior distributions to the model parameters, Bayesian inference allows for the estimation of posterior distributions for these parameters. They allow for model selection, model complexity control, and model comparison, helping to make more informed and evidence-based decisions in modeling neuronal behavior.

Their properties under consideration were either estimated empirically, by UV/Vis spectroscopy, or calculated using established medicinal chemistry software. Satisfactory correlations were found between hydrogen bonding properties and solute size and the in silico calculated bioactivity descriptors, in particular %Abs. Regarding the structural demands, Poupaert et al. where E is the excess molar refraction, S is the dipolarity/polarizability, A is the overall hydrogen bonding acidity, B is the overall hydrogen bonding basicity, V is the McGowan characteristic molar volume. where π* is an index of the solvent dipolarity/polarizability; β is a measure of the solvent hydrogen bonding acceptor (HBA) basicity; α is a measure of the solvent hydrogen bonding donor (HBD) acidity and ν0 is the regression value of this solvent property in cyclohexane as reference solvent . The regression coefficients s, b and a in Eq. (2) measure the relative susceptibilities of the absorption frequencies to the indicated solvent parameters. Due to this, Eq. (2) served for deriving data for the further QSPR studies. It was demonstrated that log P correlates well with the ratio of the contributions of specific solvent-solute interactions in the former case, and with the ratio of the relative contributions of specific and nonspecific interactions in the latter. The obtained compounds were alkylated at the N3 position using the corresponding alkyl halide in K2CO3/N,N-dimethylformamide to obtain compounds 1-7 and 11-25 (Figure 2b) . The chemical shifts are expressed in ppm values referred to TMS (δH = 0 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectra, and the residual solvent signal (δC = 39.5 ppm) in 13C NMR spectra. As expected, no significant differences between repeated measurements were observed and their uncertanity was considered to be negligible When broad bands appear (e.g., c, e and f in Figure 3), high order polynomial curves (n = 9) were fitted to the data by using Origin 8 and the absorption maxima were determined on the basis of the first derivative of the fitted curves. The correlation analysis was realized using Microsoft Office Excel 2003, which considers the 95% confidence level. The goodness of fit is discussed using the correlation coefficient (R), standard deviation (sd) and Fisher's criterion (F). In the absence of the appropriate experimental data in the literature, computer methods are used do predict ADMETox-related properties of investigated compounds. 6.\ndsum of the values of the Taft steric parameters of R1and R2. Their individual contributions are quantified by means of the LSER concept using Eq. The solvent parameters are shown in the Table 3[16, 23]. The correlation of the spectroscopic data was carried out in terms of multiple linear regressions. On the basis of high values of the multiple correlation coefficients and the Fisher criterion, the correlation results of the absorption frequencies of studied molecules in the selected solvent set with the π*, β and α parameters can be considered as satisfactory. The regression values νo, s, b and a fit at the 95% confidence level are presented together with the corresponding standard errors in Table 4. The general effectiveness of the quantification and interpretation of solvent effects on the shifts of the absorption maxima of the investigated molecules is presented in Figure 4 by means of a plot of νexp versus νcalc (R = 0.989). This might be ascribed to steric interactions which the Kamlet-Taft equation does not take into account. The similar situations were reported in the literature [24, 25]. In contrast, the HBA properties of the solvents, represented by the b coefficient, have a smaller effect. These results are in accordance with their preferred existence as the imido tautomer in solution. Based on the estimated abilities of the compounds to interact with their environment, the relationship between specific interactions and the selected structural properties, which are related to ADMETox parameters, were investigated. The log P value is a solvational characteristic, since it is directly related to the change in the Gibbs energy of solvation of a solute between n-octanol and water. The calculated values of log P were plotted against the regression coefficient a from Eq. (2), as a measure of the importance of a solute to accept a hydrogen bond, revealing two linear relationships (Figure 5), mainly due to the different structural characteristics of the substituent R1. Correlation between the log P values and the regression coefficient a derived from Eq. The presented error bars correspond to standard errors of 4, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 21 (Table 4). A satisfactory correlation of log P with a is achieved through the additional inclusion of the sum of the Taft Es values of the substituents R1 and R2 , which is presented by Eq. Compounds 8, 19 and 24 are outliers from Eq. (3) for statistical reasons, but they have no significant effect on the modeling made for the investigated set of compounds. The obtained correlation corresponds well to the Abraham characterization of the n-octanol-water partitioning system . Here, the a coefficient from Eq. The HIA values (%Abs.)

In general, this is in agreement with work of Abraham, who suggested that hydrogen bond properties are dominant in governing the HIA [35, 36]. The relative affinities for the blood or brain tissue can be expressed in terms of the blood-brain partition coefficient, log BB = log (Cbrain/Cblood), where Cbrain and Cblood are the equilibrium concentrations of a drug in the brain and blood, respectively. Based on data from the ChemSilico program, all compounds have a high chance of entering the brain because their log BB values are greater than -0.3 (Table 1). Modeling of the BBB penetration has been the subject of many studies [39–41]. Here, the relationship between the brain-blood concentration ratio with a and ΣEs implies that the properties concerned with molecular size and hydrogen bond formation are important contributors to log BB. The outliers removed to obtain Eq. The percentage data were converted into an equivalent binding affinity kA with the following formula (Eq. (6)) derived from the law of mass action. However, the correlation between the log kA values and a, enhanced through the use of Σσ* and ΣEs as additional parameters  (Eq. (7)), implies that the binding of all the investigated compounds to albumin depends on specific molecular recognition, such as directed hydrogen bonds, charge interactions and space filling of binding pockets. The LSER method enabled the overall solvent effects to be quantitatively estimated and separated into specific and nonspecific contributions. The solvatochromic behavior of the investigated compounds was related to their pharmacologically relevant properties. Accompanying calculations of log P and various pharmacokinetic data (human intestinal absorption, blood-brain barrier permeation and protein binding affinities) were performed and correlated with the spectroscopically-derived hydrogen bond accepting abilities. Moreover, their good agreement with the regression models of Abraham was demonstrated for the contributions of hydrogen bond basicity and molecular size. The approach proposed in this work could be applied to optimize ADMETox properties of compounds with potential for pharmacological application.

Bootstrapping is the practice of estimating properties of an estimator (such as its variance) by measuring those properties when sampling from an approximating distribution.
