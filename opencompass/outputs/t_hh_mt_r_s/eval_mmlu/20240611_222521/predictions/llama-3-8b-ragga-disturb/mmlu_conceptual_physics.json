Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin-orbit coupling, which is an \n\n1) A solid, liquid, or dense gas excited to emit light will radiate at all wavelengths and thus produce a continuous spectrum. ; 2) A low-density gas excited to emit light will do so at specific wavelengths and this produces an emission spectrum. ; 3) If light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, the result will be an absorption spectrum. But these discrete spectral lines were not explained as electron transitions until the Bohr model of the atom in 1913, which helped lead to quantum mechanics. Every chemical element has absorption lines at particular wavelengths, which correspond to the differences between the energy levels of its atomic orbitals. When light passes through a gas or liquid containing these elements, certain wavelengths are absorbed, resulting in dark lines or bands in the spectrum. The brightness of an atomic spectral line emitted by atoms and ions in a gas (or plasma) can depend on the gas's temperature and pressure.\n\n"

Leucite is common in lavas but very rare in plutonic rocks. In fact, many of them are petrologically indistinguishable from lavas of similar composition. Pyroclastic density currents can also produce ash particles. Within pyroclastic density currents particle abrasion occurs as particles interact with each other resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within \n\n The density of individual particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200 kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450 kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300 kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200 kg/m3 for lithic particles. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) together with a high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.\n\n"
