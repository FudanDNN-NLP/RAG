Penn's Quaker beliefs helped an attitude of toleration toward all Christian denominations spread among the population of Pennsylvania and into the colony's laws. The Frame of Government of 1701 guaranteed liberty of conscience to all who confessed and acknowledged \"one Almighty God\", and made eligible for office all who believed in \"Jesus Christ the Savior of the World.\" Although the Quakers may have resembled the Puritans in some religious beliefs and practices, they differed with them over the necessity of compelling religious uniformity in society. The efforts of the founding fathers to find a proper role for their support of religion&mdash;and the degree to which religion can be supported by public officials without being inconsistent with the revolutionary imperative of freedom of religion for all citizens&mdash;is a question that is still debated in the country today. Immigrants included nonconformists such as the Puritans, who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England, and later Dissenters, such as Baptists. The groups had a variety of attitudes on religious toleration; the Puritans, for instance, initially wanted a totally Puritan society. While some leaders, such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and Quaker William Penn of Pennsylvania, ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony in New England established churches, initially Puritan. The Dutch colony of New Netherland established its state Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship, though enforcement was sparse in what was essentially a trading, mercantile colony. In some cases, jurisdictions wanted religious conformity for financial reasons: the established Church was responsible for poor relief, putting dissenting churches at a significant disadvantage. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. In 1681, when Quaker leader William Penn parlayed a debt owed by Charles II to his father into a charter for the Province of Pennsylvania, many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in a land where they might worship freely.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school us history.

The New Deal transformed American government and reformed American society in several important respects, such as reining in Wall Street, supporting home ownership, and introducing Social Security. But the visible hallmark of the New Deal was its vast array of public works, which put millions of people back to work and put much-needed funds into the hands of impoverished families and straitened communities.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school us history.

Meanwhile, a \"self-made prophet\" in the house next door to the singer's claims that a \"Black Messiah\" \"is gonna set the world on fire\" and \"set the whole world free\". The song criticizes the so-called \"racial equality\" that blacks and whites say they strive for, saying that neither race really believes in this goal wholeheartedly. \"Old Settler's Song (Acres of Clams)\" is a Northwest United States folk song written by Francis D. Henry around 1874. The song also goes by the names \"Acres of Clams\", “Lay of the Old Settler,” “Old Settler’s Song,” while the melody is known as “Rosin the Beau,” \"Old Rosin the Beau,\" \"Rosin the Bow,\" \"Mrs. Kenny,\" \"A Hayseed Like Me,\" \"My Lodging's on the Cold, Cold Ground.\" Amit Paul, a popular singer from \n\n The Oxford Companion to the American Musical wrote that the song includes passages of \"cantor-like chanting\", and is \"the most revealing of the many character numbers\". History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe explains that the song is based on a monologue from the stories of Sholem Aleichem entitled \"If I were Rothschild\", in reference to the wealthy Jewish banking family. The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase \"if I were a rich man\" to the Cowardly Lion's \"if I were king of the forest\" in The Wizard of Oz; both songs involve a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the character's actual condition and the one they imagine. While it first appears that the song will be a nostalgic look at the speaker's childhood, the song then goes on to describe the racial violence and economic depression that the speaker witnessed as an adolescent and a young adult. Some of the song's images reference the recent history of Springsteen's hometown Freehold Borough, New Jersey, in particular the racial strife in 1960s New Jersey and economic tensions from the same times (such as the \"textile mill being closed\" was the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school us history.

Wilentz claims that those assertions are not true: \"Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws.\" Wilentz acknowledges that the Founding Fathers rejected what Samuel Adams denounced as \"utopian schemes of leveling,\" but he notes that some of the Founding Fathers were quite pragmatic when it came to policy specifics. The book asserts that the United States prospered because it was established upon universal natural law principles that had been passed down from common law and traditional Judeo-Christian morality, as many of the Founding Fathers had been guided by the Bible, among others. The Cornerstone Speech is so called because Stephens used the word \"cornerstone\" to describe the \"great truth\" of white supremacy and black subordination upon which secession and the Confederacy were based: \"[I]ts foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\" Using biblical imagery (Psalm 118, v.22), Stephens argued that divine laws consigned African Americans to slavery as the \"substratum of our society\" by saying: \"Our confederacy is founded upon principles in strict conformity with these laws. the loftiest ideals for a balanced, God-permeated life as passed down by their Master, Paramahansa Yogananda; their Founder, J.

Just before the next assembly, Christopher Cooper of Ashford published a reply to 'The Moderate Trinitarian,' &c., 1699, by Daniel Allen, whose work seems to have inspired the mediating policy of the assembly's committee. Cooper charges Caffyn with unsoundness respecting Adam's fall, Christ's satisfaction, and the soul's immortality; he quotes a description of Caffyn's opinions as 'nothing but a fardel of Mahometanism, Arianism, Socinianism, and Quakerism.' At the same time he admits that Caffyn took pains to \n\n our true Father' in his Homilies on Ephesians. Moreover, quoting partly from Paul the Apostle, Chrysostom opposed unfair and unjust forms of slavery by giving these instructions to those who owned slaves: \" 'And ye masters', he continues, 'do the same things unto them'. 'With good-will do service' ... and 'with fear and trembling' ... toward God, fearing lest He one day accuse you for your negligence toward your slaves ...

Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a divine presence and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on empirical evidence of an evidence-based outcome achieved via faith healing. Claims that \"a myriad of techniques\" such as prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, HIV/AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries. It can involve prayer, a visit to a religious shrine, or simply a strong belief in a supreme being. Many people interpret the Bible, especially the New Testament, as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. The increased interest in alternative medicine at the end of the 20th century has given rise to a parallel interest among sociologists in the relationship of religion to health. \"Death, disability, and other unwanted outcomes have occurred when faith healing was elected instead of medical care for serious injuries or illnesses.\" When parents have practiced faith healing rather than medical care, many children have died that otherwise would have been expected to live. In various belief systems\n\nChristianity\n\nOverview\n\nRegarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the Holy Spirit, faith healing often involves the laying on of hands. Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation. , after describing Jesus exorcising at sunset and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in : \"He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases\". New Testament\n\nParts of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed:  and . Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), who \"bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine\" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, \"And who is my neighbor?\" Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed all who were present every single time. Jesus told his followers to heal the sick  and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to \"cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a \"wicked and adulterous generation\". In the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord. The New Testament says that during Jesus' ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Catholicism\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes two \"not mutually exclusive\" kinds of healing, one justified by science and one justified by faith:\n healing by human \"natural means  through the practice of medicine\" which emphasizes that the theological virtue of \"charity demands that we not neglect natural means of healing people who are ill\" and the cardinal virtue of prudence forewarns not \"to employ a technique that has no scientific support (or even plausibility)\"\n healing by divine grace \"interceded on behalf of the sick through the invocation of the name of the Lord Jesus, asking for healing through the power of the Holy Spirit, whether in the form of the sacramental laying on of hands and anointing with oil or of simple prayers for healing, which often include an appeal to the saints for their aid\"\n\nIn 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued \"Instruction on prayers for healing\" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing, which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing. It accepts \"that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science\", but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence. According to U.S. Catholic magazine, \"Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific agemiracles really are possible.\" The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. According to Catholic Encyclopedia, it is often said that cures at shrines and during Christian pilgrimages are mainly due to psychotherapypartly to confident trust in Divine providence, and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places. Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of Lourdes at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to Saint Jude, who is known as the \"patron saint of lost causes\". Evangelicalism \n\nIn some Pentecostal and Charismatic Evangelical churches, a special place is thus reserved for faith healings with laying on of hands during worship services or for campaigns evangelization. Biblical inerrancy ensures that the miracles and healings described in the Bible are still relevant and may be present in the life of the believer. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings. A former English plumber turned evangelist who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. During the 1920s and 1930s, Aimee Semple McPherson was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the Great Depression. By the late 1940s, Oral Roberts, who was associated with and promoted by Branham's Voice of Healing magazine also became well known, and he continued with faith healing until the 1980s. Roberts discounted faith healing in the late 1950s, stating, \"I never was a faith healer and I was never raised that way. Christian Science\nChristian Science claims that healing is possible through prayer based on an understanding of God and the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation. The material world as humanly perceived is believed to not be the spiritual reality. Christian Scientists believe that healing through prayer is possible insofar as it succeeds in bringing the spiritual reality of health into human experience. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not consider themselves to be faith healers since faith or belief in Christian Science is not required on the part of the patient, and because they consider it reliable and provable rather than random. Although there is no hierarchy in Christian Science, Christian Science practitioners devote full time to prayer for others on a professional basis, and advertise in an online directory published by the church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. The church believes healings come most often as a result of priesthood blessings given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, Joseph Smith. Brigham Young stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God. Islam\n\nA number of healing traditions exist among Muslims. Buddhism\nChinese-born Australian businessman Jun Hong Lu was a prominent proponent of the \"Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door\", claiming that practicing the three \"golden practices\" of reciting texts and mantras, liberation of beings, and making vows, laid a solid foundation for improved physical, mental, and psychological well-being, with many followers publicly attesting to have been healed through practice. Scientology\nSome critics of Scientology have referred to some of its practices as being similar to faith healing, based on claims made by L. Ron Hubbard in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health and other writings. Scientists and doctors generally find that faith healing lacks biological plausibility or epistemic warrant, which is one of the criteria used to judge whether clinical research is ethical and financially justified. A Cochrane review of intercessory prayer found \"although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not\". Of the hundred cases reviewed, none revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability. The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient's records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. A 2011 article in the New Scientist magazine cited positive physical results from meditation, positive thinking and spiritual faith\n\nCriticism\n\nSkeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural. The first is post hoc ergo propter hoc, meaning that a genuine improvement or spontaneous remission may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the faith healer or patient did or said. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed. Belgian philosopher and skeptic Etienne Vermeersch coined the term Lourdes effect as a criticism of the magical thinking and placebo effect possibilities for the claimed miraculous cures as there are no documented events where a severed arm has been reattached through faith healing at Lourdes. Vermeersch identifies ambiguity and equivocal nature of the miraculous cures as a key feature of miraculous events. Negative impact on public health\nReliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques. Choosing faith healing while rejecting modern medicine can and does cause people to die needlessly. Don Carson is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an \"open-but-cautious\" view. In dealing with the claims of Warfield, particularly \"Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased\", Carson asserts, \"But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so.\" However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, \"Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith.\" The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts,  particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church.\" Fraud\nSkeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a quack practice in which the \"healers\" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money. James Randi's The Faith Healers investigates Christian evangelists such as Peter Popoff, who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. A Florida Justice of the Peace dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law.

The program, initially targeting eight cancers, will bring together sizable multidisciplinary groups of MD Anderson researchers and clinicians to mount comprehensive attacks on acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers -- two cancers linked at the molecular level. The Moon Shots Program takes its inspiration from President John Kennedy's famous 1962 speech, made 50 years ago this month at Rice University, just a mile from the main MD Anderson campus. \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade ... because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win,\" Kennedy said. With \"intent to cure\" as the shared purpose, each moon shot team will focus on personalized treatment; informed prediction and real-time assessment of the effect of those therapies; effective prevention and risk-management strategies; significant advances in diagnostics and early detection; and reduced treatment-related side effects that are detrimental to patients. Gravity has an elegant and experimentally precise theory: Einstein's general relativity. The other three forces also have a Lagrangian theory, called the Standard Model. Its underlying idea is that they are mediated by the exchange of spin-1 particles, the so-called gauge bosons. What is more, the gauge Lagrangian must also contain a spin 0 particle, the Higgs boson, to give mass to the spin 1/2 and spin 1 particles. This particle has yet to be observed, and if it is not detected at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, the consistency of the Standard Model is in doubt. Alain Connes has generalized Bernhard Riemann's geometry to noncommutative geometry. It describes spaces with curvature and uncertainty. Historically, the first example of such a geometry is quantum mechanics, which introduced Heisenberg's uncertainty relation by turning the classical observables of position and momentum into noncommuting operators. Noncommutative geometry is still sufficiently similar to Riemannian geometry that Connes was able to rederive general relativity. Connes has thus devised a fully geometric formulation of the Standard Model, where all the parameters are geometric invariants of a noncommutative space. In 1929 Weyl wrote Einstein that any unified theory would need to include the metric tensor, a gauge field, and a matter field. He probably didn't develop it because he was unable to geometricize it.

Can one gleam the understanding of what exists all around them without the knowledge of how one can look at what is available to us in terms of our observations? You have to be able to use \"distance\" in order to arrive at the conclusion about the current state in terms of the geometry in order to understand how such perceptions are relevant characterization toward explaining the space and what may drive the universe in terms of it's expression. The problem is that at a certain length things break down. One then ponders how such a universe is part of something much greater in expression that one might want to see how this continuity of expression is portrayed in our universe. How such a balance is struck to maintain this feature as a geometrical understanding? Cosmologists are limited by this perspective. Others venture well beyond the constrains applied by them. The extended understanding for me of Duchamp as an artist was always in context of the cubists revelation as an evolution of Quantum Gravity displayed in a Monte Carlo demonstration as membranes. David Berenstein of Shores of Dirac Sea wrote a blog entry entitled, \"Art From Math ,\" help to point out a distinction that helped to stimulate perspective about mathematical art demonstration in regard to Plot development. Yet, it presented the opportunity of expressing \"a distinction of originality\" that in context of science's regard as to see such expression as an \"original\" yet producible by example. This plot development and resulting image demonstrated by David Berenstein was repeated by Lubos's Motl's example. By revealing the subject of Duchamp's Fountain this helped to see further understanding of David Berenstein's expression of artistic mathematical imaging by accident and as a result seen as unique in science by accident. Given a preceding map by Proffessor Strassler according to what has been gain in finality views requires this updating in order to proceed correctly in the views shared currently in science.

Carter had very little foreign policy experience, and he was unable to stop the bitter infighting between his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, on the dovish side, versus national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski was a hard-line Cold Warrior opposed to Communism and the USSR. He worked closely \n\n With the new administration elected in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed Presidential Review Memorandum (PRM) 10, which undertook an evaluation of US strategy. Unlike previous Cold \n\n Lofton, Jr. said it proved that McGovern was \"the most immoral hypocrite on the American political scene today.\" McGovern's view on intervention in Southeast Asia took a turn in 1978 in reaction \n\n its alliances in East Asia and readied itself for a possible competition with a rising China while encouraging Beijing to accept a status quo that favored the United States....It forced its allies to bear a greater share of the burden in Europe and East Asia while insisting on leading both alliances. And together with its NATO allies, it asserted the right to intervene in the sovereign territory of other states, even without Security Council authorization. Clinton may cloak U.S. policy in the rhetoric of \"world order\" and general global interests, but its defining essence remains the unilateral exercise of sovereign power. blundered by stating, \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school us history.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts—one of international terrorism and one of military aggression—present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.…\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us.

They became deeply involved and led an armed occupation of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 1973. They ensured AIM would be noticed to highlight what they saw as the erosion \n\n On November 1, 1972, one week before the 1972 presidential election between President Richard Nixon and Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D. ), 500 to 800 Native Americans members of the American Indian Movement barricaded the entrances to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in downtown Washington (only six blocks from the White House). Wanting to draw attention to the poor treatment by the U.S. government (poor housing, underfunded schools, and health crises) activists demanded a meeting with Nixon and top officials. Leaders of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and Lakota supporters occupied the town of Wounded Knee, and a 71-day armed siege resulted, known as the Wounded Knee Incident. Wilson remained in office and, following the occupation, violence increased on the reservation, with residents reporting attacks by his GOONs. More than 50 of Wilson's opponents allegedly died violently in \n\n On February 27, four days after the termination of Wilson's impeachment trial, local protesters and AIM activists seized the town of Wounded Knee, in protest of the outcome of the impeachment hearing. A letter within AIM Chapters stated, \"February 27, 1973, AIM Organization accepted the responsibility of providing all necessary strength and protection needed by the Oglala Sioux in the efforts to rid themselves of corrupt tribal president, Dick Wilson.
