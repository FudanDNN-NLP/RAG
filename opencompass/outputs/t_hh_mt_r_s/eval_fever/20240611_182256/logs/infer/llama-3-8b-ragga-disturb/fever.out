You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

["House is a medical drama television series, which premiered on the Fox network in November 2004. The show is a medical mystery drama, starring Hugh Laurie in the lead role as Dr. Gregory House, an unconventional and brilliant diagnostician at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. The series is produced by Heel and Toe Productions, in association with Shore Z Productions, Bad Hat Harry Productions, and 20th Century Fox Television. The show's executive producers are David Shore, Katie Jacobs, and Paul Attanasio.\n\nThe series follows the life of Dr. House, a medical genius who has a reputation for being a difficult and unorthodox doctor. House has a team of diagnosticians, including Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), who work with him to solve medical mysteries. The show's format is similar to that of a procedural drama, with each episode focusing on a different patient and medical mystery.\n\nThe show has been praised for its strong writing, acting, and production values. Hugh Laurie's performance as Dr. House has been particularly acclaimed, earning him numerous awards and nominations,", 'House is a sitcom.']
