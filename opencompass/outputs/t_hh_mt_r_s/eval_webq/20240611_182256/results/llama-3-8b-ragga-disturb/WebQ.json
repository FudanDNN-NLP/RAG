The incoming African slave labourers—who spoke many various languages themselves—and the English speaking plantocracy communicated through the formation of a contact creole language unique to Jamaica. Today we know this creole as patois, and even those Jamaicans who don't speak it on a daily basis can speak it fluently, and fully understand it. Standard English is taught in Jamaican schools, although teachers may speak to pupils and their parents in patois outside of the classroom. It is important to note that for all practical purposes, English is Jamaica's native language. When the English took over the country from the Spanish in the seventeenth century Jamaica was linguistically a blank slate. Jamaican patois \n\n Jamaican Maroon language, Maroon Spirit language, Kromanti, Jamaican Maroon Creole or Deep patwa is a ritual language and formerly mother tongue of Jamaican Maroons.

Jamaican Patois is also spoken in Costa Rica and French Creole is spoken in Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana in South America. Often these patois are popularly considered \"broken English\" or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified with more correctness as a Creole language; in fact, in the Francophone Caribbean the analogous term for local basilectal languages is créole (see also Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole).\n\nQuestion: what does jamaican people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Polk was born in North Carolina. He later lived in and became Governor of the state of Tennessee. A Democrat, and an ardent supporter of Andrew Jackson, Polk served as Speaker of the House (1835–1839) and Governor of Tennessee (1839–1841) before becoming president. During his single four-year term, Polk accomplished every major goal that he set for his administration and successfully managed the Mexican–American War, obtaining for the United States most of its present contiguous land area. Polk was also elected to the Kent County Levy Court in 1819. In 1826, the Federalist Party selected Polk as their candidate for governor, and after a hard-fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the Democratic-Republican candidate, David Hazzard. Satisfied by these developments, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency. Polk's narrow victory over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a mandate for completing the resolution. James K. Polk was the 11th president of the United States. He was also the governor of Tennessee from 1839 to 1841.

In a letter to his father, Mozart compared this concerto with the 16th concerto in D: \"'I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat; but the B flat one beats the one in D for difficulty.'\" Beginning with this concerto, Mozart began to use the term \"grand\" to describe his concerto such as K.450 which feature a prominent and required wind section for the ensemble. The concerto is in three movements:  Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. This concerto has three movements: 1. Works written in 1784 include, besides this concerto, the five piano concertos 15–19, the Quintet in E for Piano and Winds, and several piano works – the Sonata in C minor being the most noteworthy—one string quartet (the \"Hunt\"), and several sets of orchestral dances. Works by other composers who were known to Mozart from around this time include the 80th symphony (in D minor) and second cello concerto of Joseph Haydn. A number of concertos and concertante works have been written for cor anglais (English horn) and string, wind, chamber, or full orchestra. The earliest known English horn concertos were written in the 1770s, mostly by prominent oboists of the day, such as Giuseppe Ferlendis, Ignaz Malzat (and his non-oboist brother Johann \n\n1) Allegro, ; 2) Andante, in C major ; 3) Allegretto – Presto, The Piano Concerto No. 453, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was written in 1784.

Among his many creations were the lightning rod, Franklin stove, bifocal glasses and the flexible urinary catheter. Franklin never patented his inventions; in his autobiography he wrote, \"... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.\" Benjamin Franklin was sufficiently impressed by a verrillon performance on a visit to London in 1757 that he created his own instrument, the glass armonica, in 1762. Franklin's armonica inspired several other instruments, including two created by Chladni. Its basic elements are simple to understand. One receives the real medicine; the other gets a placebo, and the researchers and the patients alike are blind to which is which. But where did the idea come from? Even scientists are surprised to learn that it was created by Benjamin Franklin. We don’t often think of Franklin’s scientific research except in terms of his work on electricity. He was the first meteorologist in America, the first geographer, the first oceanographer, an inventor of medical apparatus, and, least known of all, the first parapsychologist—a student of extraordinary and anomalous human functioning. It was in this last capacity that he created the blind protocol. In 1778 Franklin was in Paris, as America’s ambassador to the court of King Louis XVI, when the eighteenth century’s greatest medical rogue, Franz Anton Mesmer, arrived from Vienna, in a cloud of celebrity and controversy. Mesmer prudently decamped to Paris, which was where he encountered Franklin. But he also had a flamboyantly theatrical style and more than a whiff of the con; he had startling theories of illness and disturbing and erotically tinged methods of treatment. The sommambules sat holding hands around a large wooden tub filled with powdered glass and magnetized iron filings. They were relaxed and brought into rapport by the sweet haunting tones of the glass harmonica, an instrument invented, coincidentally, by Franklin. The effect was dramatic. It often worked, and Mesmer’s success made him popular with laypeople and feared by the medical establishment. However it happened, he seems to have sincerely believed he had discovered a cure for all illnesses. It is clear, though, that he had no real insight into why the trances worked. What was called for, he realized, was some sort of impartial test. It gave the effects he achieved a certain gloss, electricity, magnetism, and gravity being the high-prestige research areas of the day. We now know that he plagiarized much of this from one of the most prominent and well-regarded English physicians of the previous generation, Richard Meade (1673-1754). He also mixed in some alchemy, proposing that there existed a universal “fluid” in all living forms that could flow from one organism to another and affect a patient’s health. When he arrived in Paris, the French medical establishment, alarmed as much by his entrepreneurial success as by his unfounded theories, denied him a license to practice medicine in the city. He got around it by partnering with a disciple, the already licensed Charles d’Eslon. The four physicians asked the Academy of Sciences to add some scientists to their number, and five were chosen, including Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, the discoverer of oxygen, and Franklin, known throughout the world as the man who had discovered electricity. Franklin was by now arguably the most famous man in the Western world. Or it may be that whatever the condition of his body, his mind and his curiosity were as vigorous as ever. Franklin was not up to traveling when the commission began its work, so the first meetings were held without him and without his thoughts about how such an evaluation should be undertaken. D’Eslon explained to the commissioners that the tub was the condenser and conductor of the animal magnetism. He saw none of this as very useful. Among his other accomplishments, Franklin seems to have been the first scientist to consider demographics. On the theory that class and culture might help explain what was happening, and to allow comparisons between populations, the first session at Passy involved only lower-class patients, whose presence Franklin seems to have arranged. No cures were achieved. To this group were added Franklin, his grandsons, his secretary, an American officer, and a group of patients of d’Eslon. De Bory and Romagni felt nothing, nor did Franklin, the grandchildren, or the American officer. Franklin then suggested what became the first use of blindness and sham treatments in a scientific test. As Franklin had hoped, this was very revealing. D’Eslon touched an apricot tree in the garden with his wand, supposedly magnetizing it, and said that afterward anyone who touched the tree would be affected. Franklin, once again, saw the matter not as a question of belief but of getting unbiased evidence. D‘eslon was asked to stand several yards away from the tree. At the third he said his headache was much worse and volunteered that he felt he was getting close to the magnetized tree. Franklin and the other members of the commission in attendance were satisfied that the experiments conducted at his house, under the conditions of blindness he had devised, had settled the question of whether animal magnetism was real. Benjamin Franklin’s signature stood first, and such was his preeminence that throughout Europe and America scientists and laypeople alike felt that it had been he who had settled the issue. Although Mesmerism itself died out, the importance of Franklin’s blind protocol was not lost. In 1799 the English physician John Haygarth took the next step with the development of true placebo treatments. Haygarth refined the idea when he was asked to evaluate a medical device invented by a Connecticut doctor, Elisha Perkins. Like Mesmer’s treatments, Perkins’s were based on the manipulation of a mysterious energy. By the 1760s (or earlier) German artisans had invented a so-called \"pulse hammer\" (Pulshammer). In 1767 Benjamin Franklin visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it. Franklin's pulse hammer consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor. In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird.

On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west. Contrary to the Germans' expectations, Great Britain, along with the British Empire, declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London had demanded. However, they could do little against the 1.5 million-strong German invading force. On 2 August 1914, following the events leading to the outbreak of World War I, the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country. The ultimatum stated that Belgian independence would be reinstated upon German victory and that reparations would be made afterwards. At the start of World War I, Albert refused to comply with Germany's request for safe passage for its troops through Belgium in order to attack France, which the Germans alleged was about to advance into Belgium en route to attacking Germany in support of Russia. In fact, the French government had told its army commander not to go into Belgium before a German invasion. King Albert, as prescribed by the Belgian constitution, took personal command of the Belgian Army, and held the Germans off long enough for Britain and France to prepare for the Battle of the Marne (6–9\n\nQuestion: what country did germany invade first in ww1?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Primary elections were held on May 6, 2014. Despite FitzGerald's massive defeat, he is as of 2018 the last Democrat to carry the historically Democratic Monroe County, which voted for Republican candidate Mike DeWine four years later. Kasich's landslide victory gave him the highest percentage of the vote since George Voinovich's win in 1994, a large improvement from his narrow victory in 2010. On July 27, 2010 Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins \"edged Attorney General Drew Edmondson in the Democratic primary by fewer than six-tenths of 1 percent — about 1,500 votes — with all but three of the state's 2,244 precincts reporting unofficial results.\" In the speech, Edmondson stated, \"To her credit and mine, this primary has been one on the issues, on the record, clean, positive, straightforward. I think it will be written down in the history books as a testament to both Jari Askins and Drew Edmondson that the Democratic Party comes out of this primary united and unfractured and ready to win this state.\" Two-term Governor John Kasich was term-limited, as Ohio does not allow governors to serve three consecutive terms.

Initially, Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate, but soon after, Senator Robert F. Kennedy too challenged him. While campaigning, Kennedy was assassinated shortly after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. After Kennedy's assassination, the Democratic party nominated Vice president Hubert Humphrey as their presidential candidate. The 1964 presidential campaign of Lyndon B. Johnson was a successful campaign for Johnson and his running mate Hubert Humphrey for their election as president and vice president of the United States. Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right. Johnson took over after the assassination promising to keep Kennedy's policies and his team. In November 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One within a few hours of Kennedy's assassination. Succeeding to the presidency just about a year before the 1964 presidential election, Johnson launched War on poverty and signed Clean Air Act as his initial legislation. Lyndon B. Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973) was the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969, served as vice president during the Kennedy administration.

The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the entity that manages and operates the facility, further investigated the contamination in areas that would deem safe to conduct operations. Both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and TEPCO confirmed that this contamination was a result of \n\n Since 1973, Japan has been looking to become less dependent on imported fuel and start to depend on nuclear energy. In 2008, after the opening of 7 brand new nuclear reactors in Japan (3 on Honshū, and 1 each on Hokkaidō, Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Tanegashima) Japan became the third largest nuclear power user in the world with 55 nuclear reactors. These provide 34.5% of Japan's electricity. Following an earthquake, tsunami, and the failure of cooling systems at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on March 11, 2011, a nuclear emergency was declared. 140,000 residents within 20 km of the plant were evacuated. See Radiation effects from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster 900. The  was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima. Summary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Reports\n\nJapanese government report\nOn 5 July 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament, while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on 23 July 2012. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. Adults living in the city of Fukushima were estimated to have received, on average, an effective dose of about 4 mSv (Chapter II A(a) paragraph 30). WHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants. A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. The Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer. , six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. According to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. Finally, there has been a widely critiqued paper published by members of the controversial Radiation and Public Health Project which attempts to ascribe the natural annual cycle of rising and falling adult and infant mortality rates in the United States to Fukushima fallout, suggesting about 14,000 have died. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster. The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. Ten months after the earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear accident, perinatal mortality in 6 severely contaminated prefectures jumped up from January 2012 onward: jump odds ratio 1.156; 95% confidence interval (1.061, 1.259), P-value 0.0009. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. In severely contaminated areas, the increases of perinatal mortality 10 months after Fukushima were essentially independent of the numbers of dead and missing due to the earthquake and the tsunami.

King organized many protests attended not only by African-American, but also Caucasians. Although Malcolm X's actions were radical, especially when they contradicted that of Dr. King, but he is still considered one of the pioneers in fighting back against racial discrimination in daily life and not just from a political standpoint. Martin Luther King Jr. was but one of many notable Black ministers involved in the movement. Vivian and Jesse Jackson are among the many notable minister-activists. They were especially important during the later years of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s. She has been called a civil rights hero for her tenacity in soothing the spirit of her pastor, Martin Luther King Jr. Pollard was an elder of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, during the time of the bus boycott.

King was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, the day after giving his final speech \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\". Claims soon arose over suspect aspects of King's assassination and the controversial role of the alleged assassin, James Earl Ray. It was to these striking workers that King delivered his final speech, and in Memphis that he was killed. In Oakland, increasing friction between Black Panthers and the police led to the death of Bobby Hutton. The King assassination riots, also known as the Holy Week Uprising, were a wave of civil disturbance which swept the United States following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968. Some of the biggest riots took place in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Kansas City. On April 4, 1968, the day of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy delivered an impromptu speech on race reconciliation to a mostly African-American crowd in a poor inner-city Indianapolis neighborhood. Martin Luther King Jr. arrived in Memphis, Tennessee to support a strike by black sanitation workers in April 1968.

Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. Both Baudelaire and Poe suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, contracted tuberculosis, coughing blood while singing at the piano at the age of twenty. She died from the disease five years later and Poe's depression and alcoholism killed him two years after that. As in the death of Austen, there are a number of (conspiracy) theories as to the cause of Poe's death, including alcoholism, rabies, heart disease, cholera, drug-abuse, stroke, epilepsy, suicide, accidental suicide, delirium tremens, syphilis, tubercular meningitis and/or tuberculosis. Whatever it was that killed him, Poe was found delirious on 3 October, 1849 in the streets of Baltimore, wearing someone else's clothes. Both Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe faced various illnesses and struggles throughout their lives. Baudelaire, like Poe, had a traumatic childhood. On the other hand, Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, suffered from tuberculosis, which caused her to cough up blood while singing at the piano when she was only twenty years old. Poe himself struggled with depression and alcoholism, and his health deteriorated over time. Overall, both Baudelaire and Poe faced personal and health-related challenges, which ultimately influenced their creative lives and the works they produced. Both were also drug addicts and alcoholics, both suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and both died in sad circumstances, poor and alone in hospital rooms.Both Poe and Baudelaire were, arguably, the pioneers of modernist aesthetics.He spent the last years of his life in a semi-catatonic state in nursing homes and eventually died on 31 August, 1867.Both Baudelaire and Poe suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, contracted tuberculosis, coughing blood while singing at the piano at the age of twenty.

Although well known since the 1880s, Sebrell's insight was that it is generated in situ during the zinc-catalyzed vulcanization of rubber. He devised ways of producing mercaptothiazole on a commercial scale. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive.

After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. From 1940 to 1942, while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine, the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France. It was not until 1944 when France was liberated with the allied invasion restoring the French Government. ; 15 June — World War II: Verdun falls to German forces. ; 17 June — A Luftwaffe Junkers 88 bomber sinks the British ship RMS Lancastria, which was evacuating troops from near Saint-Nazaire, France, killing some 5,800 men. ; 21 June — World War II: Vichy France and Germany sign an armistice at Compiegne, in the same wagon-lit railroad car used by Marshal Ferdinand Foch to accept the surrender of Germany in 1918. ; 23 June — World War II: German leader Adolf Hitler surveys newly defeated Paris in now occupied France. After the stunningly quick defeat in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war; part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country. The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them as prisoners of war in camps inside of Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police. German forces split the French from their British allies by striking through the lightly-defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks. The invaders forced the British Expeditionary Force to evacuate, and defeated several French divisions before they advanced to Paris, and down the strategic Atlantic coast. By June, the dire French military situation had French politics revolving around whether the Third Republic should negotiate an armistice, fight on from North Africa, or just surrender. President Albert Lebrun \n\n The best, most modernised French armies had been sent north and lost in the resulting encirclement; the French had lost their best heavy weaponry and their best armored formations.

The religion of Islam founded by Muhammad in 7th century Arabia incorporated ideas from Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Christianity, specifically monotheism, Last Judgment, Heaven and Hell. However, it is closer to Judaism than Christianity, since it believes in the Unity of God, and God is seen as powerful rather than loving. The doctrine of Islam is based on five pillars: Shahada, faith; Salat, prayer; Zakat, alms-giving; Sawm, fasting; and Hajj, pilgrimage. Its beliefs are collected in the Quran, composed in its final form by 933. The first pillar, the shahadah or profession of faith is the affirmation \"There is no god but God (Allah) and Muhammad is his prophet.\" The fifth requires a pilgrimage to Mecca for those able to perform it, to participate in the special rites that occur during the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. The first shahada promotes the essential unity of the faith, proclaiming that there is no god but God. They are summarized in the famous hadith of Gabriel. The Sunni and Shia agree on the basic details of the performance and practice of these acts, but the Shia do not refer to them by the same name (see Ancillaries of the Faith, for the Twelvers, and Seven pillars of Ismailism). They are: Muslim creed, prayer, charity to the poor, fasting on the month of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca for those who are able.\n\nQuestion: what are some of the traditions of islam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Frederick is home to Frederick Municipal Airport (IATA: FDK), which accommodates general aviation, and Fort Detrick, a U.S. Army bioscience/communications research installation and Frederick county's largest employer. As the county seat for Western Maryland, Frederick not only was an important market town but also the seat of justice. Although Montgomery County and Washington County were split off from Frederick County in 1776, Frederick remained the seat of the smaller (though still large) county.

In 1851, while living with the family of William Still, a clerk at the Pennsylvania Abolition Society who helped refugee slaves make their way along the Underground Railroad, Harper started to write \n\n Atticus Finch's willingness to support social outcasts and victims of prejudice is the eponymous inspiration for the name of the Atticus Circle, which is an organization composed of \"straight allies\" (that is, heterosexual people supportive of the LGBT rights movement). In 2016, the lawyer Joseph Madison Beck published the memoir My Father & Atticus Finch, in which he noted the numerous parallels between his father Foster Beck's defense of a black man accused of raping a white woman in the 1938 trial State of Alabama vs. Charles White, Alias, and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird. In a letter to the author, Harper Lee herself noted the \"obvious parallels\" between the cases (Lee was 12 at the time of the Charles White trial) and between Atticus Finch and Foster Beck, though she also stated that she could not recall the trial, and that To Kill a Mockingbird was a work of fiction. Former President Barack Obama referenced Atticus Finch as an ideal American character, and mentioned him during his farewell address to the nation on January 11, 2017.\n\n the next few years, it was reprinted several times. In 1858, Harper refused to give up her seat or ride in the \"colored\" section of a segregated trolley car in Philadelphia (97 years before Rosa Parks). Atticus is a lawyer and resident of the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, and the father of Jeremy \"Jem\" Finch and Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch. He represents the African-American man Tom Robinson in his trial where he is charged with rape of Mayella Ewell. Lee based the character on her own father, Amasa Coleman Lee, an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial. In 1960, Harper Lee, born in Monroeville, published perhaps the most celebrated novel set in Alabama, To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nQuestion: what highschool did harper lee go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is replaced by Nikita Khrushchev, who began a period of De-Stalinization. Over the course of the game's story, the Allies and Soviets fight for control over the European mainland in an alternate World War II:\n\nThe deaths of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin within two decades after the Yalta Conference had significant historical and political ramifications. It may have exacerbated post-WWII miscommunication between America and the Soviet Union, which may have contributed to the onset of the Cold War. Premier Stalin's death, eight years after the conference, also had significant political implications. As the leader of the Soviet Union, his passing marked a transition in power and potential shifts in Soviet foreign policy. This had implications not only for the Soviet Union but also for international relations and the balance of power during the post-war era. According to Richard Pipes, the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for World War II. Pipes argues that both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a \"genius\". According to Pipes, Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to assert Soviet power internationally. Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitler's rule began in 1933.\n\nQuestion: who was the leader of soviet union during wwii?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is transcendent and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. According to Islamic belief, Allah is the most common word to represent God, and humble submission to his will, divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith. \"He is unique (wāḥid) and inherently one (aḥad), all-merciful and omnipotent.\" Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edward Peters, \"The Qur’ān insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews . The Qur’an's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham\". 1) Belief in God ; 2) Belief in the Angels ; 3) Belief in Divine Books ; 4) Belief in the Prophets ; 5) Belief in the Day of Judgment ; 6) Belief in God's predestination It is a fundamental constituent in a Muslim’s belief system to believe in the unseen.

Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in Animal Farm and 1984.

In the 1940s, Dodger management, led by Branch Rickey and O'Malley’s father and partner, Walter, took the bold step to break baseball’s color barrier.

Frémont, who eventually dropped out of the race after brokering a deal with Lincoln) and the War Democrats (the minority of Democrats who backed Lincoln's prosecution of the war, as opposed to the Peace Democrats, or Copperheads, who favored a negotiated settlement with the Confederates). Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy. To sound a theme of unity in 1864, Lincoln ran under the banner of the National Union Party, rather than that of the Republicans. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution \n\n ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.

In November 2005, Barnes & Noble issued reprints of the Nonesuch editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including Bleak House, Great Expectations and Hard Times, the Christmas Books, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby. Nonesuch editions of Dickens' novels have also been republished by Duckworth in the UK. Dickens began by writing seventeen episodes, which were printed in All the Year Round between 28 January and 13 October 1860 and these were published in a single edition in 1861. Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875.

Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings. Da Vinci's anatomical studies were groundbreaking during his time and greatly advanced the understanding of human anatomy. Furthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. The anatomical knowledge he gained improved his ability to portray the human form, leading to the creation of masterpieces such as \"The Last Supper\" and the iconic \"Vitruvian Man.\" In addition to his artistic and scientific contributions, da Vinci's anatomical drawings also highlight his multidisciplinary approach as a true \"uomo universale\" or \"universal man.\" Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist. By virtue of their scientific significance, artistic excellence, and their portrayal of da Vinci's insatiable curiosity about the natural world, his anatomical drawings continue to inspire and captivate viewers even today. They serve as a testament to da Vinci's genius, and his holistic approach to understanding the beauty and complexity of the human form. When he received the commission for The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci had never worked on a piece of this great a size, fifteen feet high by almost twenty-nine feet wide. This method requires fresco painters to work quickly and with a pre-set plan.

Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa has become one of the most recognizable paintings in the world since it was created in 1503.

Austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the German spelling reform of 1996—several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in Vienna at the invitation of the Austrian federal government—and adopted it as a signatory, along with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, of an international memorandum of understanding (Wiener Absichtserklärung) signed in Vienna in 1996.

Lennon recorded the album from early to mid-1971 at Ascot Sound Studios, Abbey Road Studios and the Record Plant in New York City, with supporting musicians that included his ex-Beatles bandmate George Harrison, keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Alan White and Jim Keltner. Its lyrics reflect peace, love, politics, Lennon's experience with primal scream therapy, and, following a period of high personal tensions, an attack on his former writing partner Paul McCartney in \n\n Beatles. Lennon also indulged his love of rock and roll with \"Crippled Inside\" and \"It's So Hard\". In early 1969, John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, held nonviolent protests against the Vietnam War, dubbed the Bed-ins for Peace. The resulting chant was only a line long: \"Come together and join the party\". I don't really go 'round with those thoughts in my head all the time ...\" The track \"Imagine\" became Lennon's signature song and was written as a plea for world peace. Years later he acknowledged Ono's role in the song's creation and stated his regret that he had not credited her as a co-writer. Together, Lennon and Ono lament police brutality in \"Attica State\", the hardships of war-torn Northern Ireland in \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"The Luck of the Irish\" (see Bloody Sunday (1972) article), and pay tribute to Angela Davis with \"Angela\".\n\nQuestion: what type of music did john lennon sing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Neither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands are members of the European Union. Based in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, the organization was founded on 19 July 1989 by the Government of Greenland. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender  (LGBT) rights in Greenland are some of the most extensive in the Americas and the world, relatively similar to those in Denmark proper in Europe.

However, the standard Chinese writing system uses a non-alphabetic script with an alphabet for supplementary use. There is no original alphabet native to China. However, there were attempts to replace the whole Chinese script with alphabets but failed in the end, so the Chinese characters were kept. including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. This system is relatively standardised, and could be considered a true writing system. The system would be devised by the writer himself, with one's own understanding of the Arabic and Persian alphabets, mapped accordingly \n\n Chinese calligraphy is the stylized, artistic writing of Chinese characters; the written form of Chinese that unites the languages spoken in China.\n\nQuestion: what do you call the chinese writing system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Several Soviet Socialist Republics began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government. The history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991 spans the period from Leonid Brezhnev's death and funeral until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Due to the years of Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development, and complex systemic problems in the command economy, Soviet output stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the proxies of the United States against the Soviet Union's forces in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Baltic Regions republics and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the basic legitimating myth of the Soviet Union's federative system—that it was a voluntary and mutual union of allied peoples – eased the task of secession and independence. On January 25, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet Republics a \"delay-action bomb\". The collapse of the Soviet Union caught many people by surprise.

Darwin pondered why humans and animals were often generous to their \n\n the Origin of Species. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. Although the acceptance of human antiquity and natural selection originated from separate intellectual traditions, they had a powerful influence on scientific thinking during this time. The consensus on 'the antiquity of man' was established by Scottish geologist Charles Lyell, just two months before the publication of Charles Darwin's influential work, \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. This consensus, including the understanding that humans had a long history on Earth, provided a crucial foundation for the intelligibility and eventual acceptance of evolution by natural selection. He carefully argues out this theory by presenting accumulated scientific evidence from his voyage on the Beagle in the 1830s, and from his continuing studies up to the date of publication. ; Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences.

He wrote two books;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872 that dealt with topics related to evolutionary psychology. Darwin pondered why humans and animals were often generous to their \n\n Between 1868 and 1872, the life and work of Charles Darwin from Descent of Man to Emotions continued with aspects of his intended \"Big Book\" on evolution through natural selection. He now published his ideas on human evolution and on how beautiful but apparently impractical features could have evolved in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. After revising The Origin of Species as the definitive 6th edition, his major works on species culminated in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. The main point of Darwin's theory is that organisms with traits that are better suited to the conditions in which they live are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations.Since that fateful day, the genes for other diseases, such as Huntington's disease, inherited forms of breast cancer, sickle cell anemia, Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy, have been found. Through his experiments, Mendel established that genetic factors are passed from parents to offspring and remain unchanged in the offspring so that they can be passed on again to the next generation. Evolving the Theory of Natural Selection\n\nCharles Darwin's study of giant tortoises and finches on the Galapagos Islands led to his famous theory of natural selection (also known as \"survival of the fittest\"), which he published in his 1859 book titled On the Origin of Species. The main point of Darwin's theory is that organisms with traits that are better suited to the conditions in which they live are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations.Thus, over time, the traits seen in a population of organisms in a given area can change.The significance of Darwin's theory of natural selection can be seen today in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Formulating Cell Theory\n\nIn 1839, zoologist Theodor Schwann and botanist Matthias Schleiden were talking at a dinner party about their research. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \"a burning zeal\" to research natural history.

Leeuwenhoek is often considered the father of microbiology for his groundbreaking observations using microscopes he designed himself. He was the first to accurately describe and document microorganisms like bacteria, red blood cells, and spermatozoa. He was a Dutch scientist who lived in the 17th century. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is often referred to as the Father of Microbiology and is renowned for his groundbreaking work in the field of microscopy. Van Leeuwenhoek's discoveries significantly advanced the understanding of the microscopic world and laid the foundation for modern microbiology. His contributions revolutionized the way we perceive the world and uncover the intricate details of living organisms. Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the famous 17th century microscopist, discovered living organisms (living, because they were mobile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call dental plaque). The first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Jan Swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but had not published his findings at the time. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, improvements in microscope technology such as achromatic lenses allowed white blood cells and platelets to be counted in unstained \n\nSome notable scientists who contributed to the development of the microscope and its use in scientific research include Marcello Malpighi, Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, and Georgios Nicholas Papanikolaou. Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was a Dutch biologist known as the \"Father of Microbiology.\" Van Leeuwenhoek discovered and described various microorganisms, such as bacteria, protists, and sperm cells, providing valuable insights into the microscopic world. Hooke's book \"Micrographia\" published in 1665 showcased his observations and discoveries, including the first recorded observation of biological cells, which he named \"cells\" due to their resemblance to living quarters of monks. By utilizing the microscope, he identified cellular changes associated with cancer, revolutionizing the field of cytopathology. These scientists played critical roles in improving microscope design, expanding our understanding of microscopic structures, and pioneering various research techniques.

The next year saw Suzuki becoming the largest small car manufacturer in Japan, The two wheeler division, the third behind Honda and Yamaha and the outboard engine division making rapid strides. Osamu Suzuki led the formation of a capital alliance with competitor Toyota Motor Corp in 2019 in a bid to partner in the development of self-driving vehicles. However, as light glass fibre boats pushed aside the heavy wooden boats, American and Swedish produced outboard engines replaced the middle engines over time. The company started in 1937 assembling refrigerators from parts sent in from Waukegan, Illinois The factory expanded making many other household products. In 1941, Gale Products was acquired by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC) to build outboard motors. After building over one million motors, the parent company OMC ceased boat motor manufacturing reusing the facility as the new headquarters and factory of Lawn-Boy lawn mowers. Eventually, Lawn-Boy was sold to its competitor Toro where offices were moved to Minnesota and manufacturing was moved to other Toro facilities.

It has 500 characters on the \n\n Oracle bone script was an early form of Chinese characters written on animals' bones. Written on oracle bones – animal bones or turtle plastrons – it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. The first appearance of what we recognize unequivocally to refer as \"oracle bone inscriptions\" comes in the form of inscribed ox scapulae and turtle plastrons from sites near modern Anyang (安阳) on the northern border of Henan province. Though there is no proof that the Shang dynasty was solely responsible for the origin of writing in China, neither is there evidence of recognizable Chinese writing from any earlier time or any other place. The earliest confirmed evidence of the Chinese script yet discovered is the body of inscriptions on oracle bones and bronze from the late Shang dynasty. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. For inventories, contracts, and letters, the geba script was used. As its purpose need not expand to the realm of daily use among non-religious specialists—after all, literate Naxi today, as in the past, write in Chinese—at most it will presumably but continue to fulfill the needs of demon exorcism, amusing tourists and the like.\"\n\nQuestion: what was the ancient chinese writing system?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His story is read in the weekly Torah reading portions, predominantly in the parashot: Lech-Lecha (לֶךְ-לְךָ), Vayeira (וַיֵּרָא), Chayei Sarah (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and Toledot (תּוֹלְדֹת). Ḥanan b.

Haran is the father of Lot, who is Abram's nephew; the entire family live in Ur of the Chaldees. The Patriarchs in Hebrew bible are Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob, also named Israel, the ancestor of the Israelites. Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to Ishmael about founding a great nation, Isaac, Abraham's son by his half-sister Sarah, inherits God's promises to Abraham. After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a concubine named Keturah, by whom he had six sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

It was originally composed as Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata in Bengali by polymath Rabindranath Tagore. The first stanza of the song Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950. The melody that would become India's National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana, was first performed, on the occasion of a meeting in Calcutta of the Indian National Congress. Composed by Rabindranath Tagore, the song originally had lyrics in the Bengali language. The first Asian laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, wrote the words and music of \"Jana Gana Mana\" and \"Amar Shonar Bangla\", later adopted as the national anthems of India and Bangladesh respectively. Jana Gana Mana was written in shadhu-bhasha, a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata that Tagore composed.

Roswell Park is among a select group of Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. The Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry was established at Roswell Park in 1981 by then-Chair of Gynecologic Oncology, M. Steven Piver, MD. In 1990, it was named The Gilda Radner Registry to honor the memory of American comedian Gilda Radner, who died of ovarian cancer in 1989. Her husband, actor and producer Gene Wilder generously agreed to lend his late wife’s name to the registry in an effort to increase awareness of the disease and to help national research efforts. Under the direction of Dr. Odunsi, the Registry is investigating other genetic causes of ovarian cancer in order to better detect, prevent and treat the disease.

Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III (March 2, 1917 – December 2, 1986), better known as Desi Arnaz, was a Cuban-American actor, musician, bandleader, comedian and film and television producer, revolutionary in the creation of modern television. He is best known for his role as Ricky Ricardo on the American television sitcom I Love Lucy, in which he co-starred with his then-wife Lucille Ball. Arnaz and Ball are generally credited as the innovators of the syndicated rerun, which they pioneered with the I Love Lucy series. Arnaz and Lucille Ball co-founded and ran the television production company called Desilu Productions, originally to market I Love Lucy to television networks. After I Love Lucy ended, Arnaz went on to produce several other television series, at first with Desilu Productions, and later independently, including The Ann Sothern Show and The Untouchables. Moore remained a regular on The Lucy Show through the end of the 1964–1965 season after which the premise of the show was retooled and most of the supporting cast was written out. His parents were the stars of the television sitcom I Love Lucy, and Ball's pregnancy was part of the storyline, which was considered daring in 1952. I Love Lucy is an American television sitcom that originally aired on CBS from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes, spanning six seasons. The show starred Lucille Ball, her then real-life husband, Desi Arnaz, along with Vivian Vance and William Frawley. The series followed the life of Lucy Ricardo (Ball), a young, middle-class housewife living in New York City, who often concocted plans with her best friends, Ethel and Fred Mertz (Vance and Frawley), to appear alongside her bandleader husband, Ricky Ricardo (Arnaz), in his nightclub.

The style of guitar playing displayed by Hendrix is said to be reminiscent of that of American jazz guitarists Jim Hall and Wes Montgomery, according to fellow guitarist Mike Stern, who said the following about the song: \"His playing is so lyrical. But the thing about Hendrix was that he had that sound, he could achieve that lyrical feeling with a fatter sound on his Strat than you could get with a regular hollow-bodied jazz guitar.\" In the Hendrix biography Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy, the song is described as \"creak[ing] with radical harmonies and rhythmic concepts, not least the fact that the verse is in 3/4 time while the chorus is in 4/4.\" Hendrix historians Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek have praised \"Are You Experienced?\" as \"a majestic setpiece of declamatory anthem rock\": \"Mitch [Mitchell]'s military snare raps out behind the startlingly contemporary hip-hop scratch sound-effects of tapes running backwards punctuating Jimi's condition for being your guide ('If you can get your mind together').

Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost many profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention into securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 by Eli Whitney changed the face of agriculture in the American South. Whitney's gin was produced in response to the state of Georgia's appointed commission for the promotion of a gin suitable to remove seed from fibers on the short-staple, green-seed cotton.

Portuguese has two official written standards, (i) Brazilian Portuguese (used chiefly in Brazil) and (ii) European Portuguese (used in Portugal and Angola, Cape Verde, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Macau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe). Unlike the written language, however, there is no spoken-Portuguese official standard, but the European Portuguese reference pronunciation is the educated speech of Lisbon.

For many centuries, the Church of San Isidro served as a de facto cathedral, but while this church was associated with the patron saint of Madrid, St. Isidore was also the patron of manual laborers, not royalty, thereby relegating the role of royal chapel to this church.

Designated a California Historical Landmark, the mission is one of many locally designated landmarks in downtown Ventura. The mission was named after St. Bonaventure, a 13th-century Franciscan saint, one of the early leaders of the Order to which the friars belonged, and a Doctor of the Church. Built at an unknown date between 1792 and 1809, it was located approximately five miles from the main mission, inland and upstream along the Ventura River.

World War I has been \n\n Although in 1915 Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, the Italian government of Antonio Salandra had entered into clandestine discussions to join the Triple Entente. This led to the signing of the secret Treaty of London on 26 April by which Italy agreed to enter the war within one month. On 4 May Italy renounced the Triple Alliance, but did not yet enter the war in the side of the Entente as a majority in parliament continued to favour neutrality. The former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was warned that Salandra intended to take the country to war, and on 9 May he returned to Rome to try to prevent this. On 10 May he tried to persuade King Victor Emmanuel that a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies would show that parliament did not support entry into the war. Fiorenzo Bava Beccaris was born in Fossano, and took part in the Crimean War and the Italian Wars of Independence. In May 1898, when serious riots arising from high food prices broke out in Milan, the Italian government under Antonio di Rudinì declared a state of siege in the city. In recognition of his action Bava Beccaris received the Great Cross of the Order of Savoy from King Umberto I in June 1898. During 1914, he warmly supported the interventionist party in Italy who wished to participate in World War I, (as they did on 25 May 1915). In 1922, he recommended that King Victor Emmanuel III grant power to Benito Mussolini and the National Fascist Party. He died in Rome in 1924. Unlike the German Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini was officially only the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy. Initially the King and his staff (conscious of the Italian lack of preparation to war) did not approve Mussolini's intentions, but when France was clearly defeated in June 1940, the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) was abruptly sent to war. Mussolini made the mistake to believe that Britain would accept peace agreements with the Axis after France's surrender, and did not anticipate a long lasting war.\n\nQuestion: who was the italian leader in ww1?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The park is managed by the County of Maui and the Lahaina Restoration Foundation. According to reports a royal ball was held under the tree in 1886 for King Kamehameha III on his birthday. The Aloha Festivals Week has been held under this tree.

Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious. Once SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon. Initial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. The resulting wildfire was allowed to burn until noticed by firefighting services in the region, and was explained as an accident involving Spruce Creek's stores of emergency gasoline. The following is a series of notes collected from the forest surrounding Spruce Creek. A search for the apparent surviving SCP-3105 victim has been initiated, but has yet to produce results. I’m not sure why I’m in the mountains, and I can’t remember driving here, but it’s nice. The cabin’s fully stocked with food. In the meantime, it looks like my kayak is still in serviceable shape. The sun wheels through the sky, dragging the shadows behind it. It seems to tarnish the firmament, turning the polished silver, yellow, then a blazing red. The mountains put out the fire, and the stars peer out from the endless darkness above. The river is wild, higher than I’ve ever seen it at this time of year. My kayak sustained some damage, so I don’t think I’ll be taking it out again until I can get back to town and repair it. I woke up in the cabin today. It’s a little unusual, but I understand the allure. It is beautiful out there. The yellow aspens are quite a sight. It migrates north along the Pacific Coast in the spring, but returns to the wintering grounds in Mexico via an inland route along the Rocky Mountains. It looks like there’s a big wildfire to the east. They say the fire season gets longer every year. I noticed today that my kayak’s been scuffed up really badly. I took a look at the locks and I didn’t notice any obvious tampering. I’ll check the windows tomorrow. Thunder echoes through valleys. It’s loud. The fire is getting closer. The smoke is irritating my throat. Fire is rebirth. Then there is only ash. I’m not sure what’s going on. I woke up choking on smoke. When I ran outside, the sky was on fire. The valleys below are filled with fireflies. The chop of the rotors shakes the soles of my shoes. It sure is cold. The rain is coming down pretty hard, but if I follow this road, I should get somewhere nicer. Right? The mountains stand in the hazy distance, a dark silhouette against the soft pastel colors of the sunset. Wispy clouds sail by above as the car thrums away, into the golden plains. There is no smoke in the air. What's going on? Huh. Too late. It's always been too late. I'm not sure how it happened, but we messed something up. No it doesn't. 4. ʻewa means traveling toward the western tip of the island, \"Diamond Head\" is toward the eastern tip, mauka is inland (toward the central Koʻolau Mountain range, north of Honolulu) and makai toward the sea.

Researchers at the Rudolf Virchow Center aim to trace diseases back to dysfunctions of proteins. The Rudolf Virchow Center also organizes a graduate program and several undergraduate programs in biomedicine and experimental medicine,. In 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics.In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin.He pioneered the modern concept of pathological processes by his application of the cell theory to explain the effects of disease in the organs and tissues of the body. Moreover, he campaigned vigorously for social reforms and contributed to the development of anthropology as a modern science. In 1839 Virchow began the study of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute of the University of Berlin and was graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1843. At Würzburg Virchow published many papers on pathological anatomy. He began there the publication of his six-volume _Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie_ (\"Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics\"), most of the first volume of which he wrote himself. At Würzburg he also began to formulate his theories on cellular pathology and started his anthropological work with studies of the skulls of cretins (dwarfed, mentally deficient individuals) and investigations into the development of the base of the skull. During the 19th century, Germany was the center of the medical world, and several influential physicians emerged during this time. Some notable figures were Kussmaul, Quincke, von Recklinghausen, Müller, and Schönlein. These physicians made significant contributions to medicine and clinical observation, and their relationships with Virchow played a crucial role in shaping their work. In particular, Virchow's relationships with his mentors Müller and Schönlein had a profound impact on the development of Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen as students of Virchow. Virchow, as a mentor, provided guidance and inspiration to his students, fostering an environment of scientific and intellectual growth. Von Recklinghausen, also a student of Virchow, had a significant impact on the field of medicine through his contributions to pathology and dermatology. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of cells and cancer. Although Virchow made significant contributions to cellular biology and our understanding of cancer, it is important to mention that he rejected the notion that bacteria can cause disease and the value of cleanliness in preventing infection. His contributions laid the foundation for further research in the field of biology and continue to influence the fields of molecular biology and genetics today. Some of the contributions and accomplishments of Virchow during his time in Berlin include:\n\n1. Pathological Anatomy: Virchow published numerous papers on pathological anatomy and began his six-volume \"Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie\" (Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics) while at Würzburg. Cellular Pathology: Virchow formulated theories on cellular pathology during his time at Würzburg. Anthropological Work: Virchow started his anthropological work, studying the skulls of cretins and investigating the development of the base of the skull. His anthropological research contributed to the understanding of human anatomy and the effects of various conditions on skeletal structures. He focused on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, hospital design, meat inspection, and school hygiene. He supervised the design of two new Berlin hospitals, opened a nursing school, and designed the city's sewer system. Virchow's contributions had a profound impact on medicine and public health, shaping our understanding of diseases, promoting advancements in anatomical research, and advocating for healthcare improvements.\n\nQuestion: where did rudolf virchow conduct his research?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 2001 to 2007 he was a member of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Council of Economic Advisers, specialising in education policy, local government affairs & EU policy. From 2007 to 2010 he served as an adviser to Prime Minister Gordon Brown, covering foreign policy; Northern Ireland; and culture, media and sports policy. After the 2010 election he helped run Ed Miliband's campaign to become Leader of the Labour Party, and served as an adviser to Ed Miliband, the Labour party's leader, from 2010 to 2015. Muir worked closely with Peter Mandelson and Philip Gould on the Labour Party's 2010 general election campaign. He is believed to have argued for a hard edged attack on the Conservatives and their threat to middle income earners. It is also believed that he supported Gordon Brown's decision not to serve a full term. Muir left Downing Street when Gordon Brown resigned in May 2010.

It is generally considered a sequel and was created to update the public concerning developments since the multi-million-copy bestseller A Brief History of Time was published in 1988. Stephen Hawking has lived with ALS for the majority of his life. He's pictured delivering a lecture to mark NASA's 50th anniversary in 2008. Its symptoms mimic those of other diseases (such as Parkinson's) and there isn't one test to spot it. Often doctors will rule out other diseases to arrive at a diagnosis. British physicist Stephen Hawking has defied the odds, living for more than 45 years with the disease. Hawking was diagnosed at 21, while a graduate student at Cambridge University. He has been wheelchair-bound since the 1970s. In 1985, he developed pneumonia and had to have a tracheotomy operation, which robbed him of his ability to speak. When a computer whiz in California heard of Hawking's plight, he sent him a computer program called Equalizer that could speak for him. Since then, Hawking has become known for the synthesized, computer-generated voice that enables him to speak. Determined early on not to let the disease steal his life, Hawking went on to become one of the world's preeminent physicists. He published the best-selling book, \"A Brief History of Time,\" and he has made great contributions to the fields of quantum gravity and cosmology. A Brief History of Time is a 1991 biographical documentary film about the physicist Stephen Hawking, directed by Errol Morris. The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but, whereas the book is solely an explanation of cosmology, the film is, additionally, a biography of Hawking's life, featuring interviews with some of his family members and colleagues. In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to \"combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\"\n\nQuestion: what did stephen hawking become famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Roosevelt, who had been a victim of polio early in life, died in April 1945, and Truman assumed the Presidency through the end of the war. Roosevelt was known for his ability to connect with the American people through his fireside chats, where he explained his policies and reassured citizens during times of crisis. Secondly, Roosevelt's implementation of various economic recovery programs, such as the New Deal, helped alleviate the hardships faced by the American people during the Great Depression. Furthermore, Roosevelt's decisive actions and strong leadership during World War II were instrumental in garnering support. He led the nation through this challenging time, effectively mobilizing and uniting the American people towards a common goal. His administration's efforts in creating war industries, implementing rationing, and promoting patriotism fostered a sense of solidarity among citizens. Overall, Roosevelt's popular support was influenced by his leadership, effective communication, and the tangible impact of his policies in alleviating the hardships of the Great Depression. Additionally, his strong leadership during World War II further solidified his support among the American people, with economic class playing a role in shaping opinions, particularly during peacetime.

The mouvement was never made official with documents signed by members of a list of criteria in order for work to be considered Fauvism, but it was simply a small group of mainly French painters who used brilliant colour and unexpected brushstrokes, similar to the German Expressionism mouvement. Matisse created the Fauve style after experimenting with post-impressionistic painters, such as Gauguin, Cézanne and Van Gogh, as well as the Neo-impressionism of Cross, Signac and Seurat. All these painters inspired Matisse to reject 3D uses of spaces and use colour and mouvement to create 2D planes of space. design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain, Fauvism, Cubism, and Orphism, among others. Clamoring against the \"prostitution of art\", he kept burning all of his paintings he was able to lay his hands on \n\n Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (, ; ; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French Post-Impressionist artist. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.\n\nQuestion: what artistic movement did henri matisse belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lewis on August 12, 1805 said he visited the headwaters on Trail Creek just above Lemhi Pass on the Continental Divide in the Beaverhead Mountains at around 8,600 feet which he described:  In 1888 Jacob V. Brower, who had championed turning the headwaters of the Mississippi River into a Minnesota state park, visited another site which today is also claimed to be the furthest point on the Missouri. Brower published his finding in 1896 in \"The Missouri: Its Utmost Source.\" On 7 March 1876 a cutoff formed suddenly across the neck of a meander, known as the \"Devil's Elbow\", in the Mississippi River near Reverie, Tennessee, shortening the river's course and leaving the town connected to Arkansas, but across the new river channel from the rest of Tennessee. Later that spring, heavy rains and rapid snowmelt upstream led to flooding along the Missouri River, which damaged property and closed the river to navigation. The drought of 2012 narrowed navigation channels, forced lock closures, and caused dozens of barges to run aground on the Mississippi River along the Missouri shoreline. Because of extensive channeling the Little Chariton River, formerly a tributary, now flows directly into the Missouri about 7 mi from the main branch.\n\nQuestion: where the missouri river ends?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Thai baht banknotes commonly include the portrait or the picture of the sculpture of its kings. From 1985 to 1996, Thailand's economy grew at an average of over 9% per year, the highest economic growth rate of any country at the time. The baht was pegged at 25 to the U.S. dollar.

However, according to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The 1905 law on secularity was highly controversial at the time, but today is held as a founding document of French secularism or laïcité. Some French politicians and communities have more recently questioned the law, arguing that, despite its explicit stance for state secularism, it de facto favors traditional French religions, in particular the Catholic Church, at the expense of more recently established religions, such as Islam. 1814–1848 during the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy, the Chamber of Deputies was the lower house of the French Parliament, elected by census suffrage.

Hawking had earlier speculated that the singularity at the centre of a black hole could form a bridge to a \"baby universe\", into which the lost information could pass; such theories have been very popular in science fiction.

The 2016 work posits that the information is saved in \"soft particles\", low-energy versions of photons and other particles that exist in zero-energy empty space. Since Hawking's publication, many others have verified the result through various approaches.

Congressional Republicans made two serious efforts to repeal the ACA. First, in March 2017, Trump endorsed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), a Republican bill to repeal and replace the ACA. Opposition from several House Republicans, both moderate and conservative, led to the defeat of this version of the bill. Over the next weeks the Senate made several attempts to create a repeal bill; however, all the proposals were \n\n Democrats call for \"affordable and quality health care\" and favor moving toward universal health care in a variety of forms to address rising healthcare costs.

The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River. Examples preceding European contact include the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, the Blackfoot Confederacy, and Powhatan Confederacy in three different regions. they began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the potlatch. In present-day upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal nations in the mid-15th century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the United States government. The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans. As their territory expanded, smaller tribes were forced further west, including the Osage, Kaw, Ponca, and Omaha peoples.\n\nQuestion: where did the iroquois indians come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Navajo is an Athabaskan language of the Na-Dené family, with 178,000 speakers, primarily in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Western Apache, with 12,500 speakers, also mostly in Arizona, is closely related to Navajo but not mutually intelligible with it. Navajo and other Athabaskan languages in the Southwest are relative outliers; most other Athabascan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Navajo has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs in the Navajo Nation, including a Navajo language immersion school in Fort Defiance, Arizona. Tlingit: 1,360 speakers ; Athabaskan–Eyak ; Eyak: the last native speaker died in 2008 ; Athabaskan ; Northern ; Pacific Coast ; Southern In its uncontroversial core, Na-Dene consists of two branches, Tlingit and Athabaskan–Eyak: For linguists who follow Edward Sapir in connecting Haida to the above languages, Haida represents an additional branch, with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit together forming the other. Dene or Dine (the Athabaskan languages) is a widely distributed group of Native languages spoken by associated peoples in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Alaska, parts of Oregon, northern California, and the American Southwest as far as northern Mexico. Eyak was spoken in south-central Alaska; the last first language speaker died in 2008. Navajo is by far the most widely spoken language of the Na-Dene family, spoken in Arizona, New Mexico, and other regions of the American Southwest.

In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation. Rutherford moved in 1907 to the Victoria University of Manchester (today University of Manchester) in the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. In 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.\n\nQuestion: what school did sir ernest rutherford go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Harvard College students participate in more than 450 extracurricular organizations and nearly all live on campus—first-year students in or near Harvard Yard, and upperclass students in community-oriented \"houses\". Massachusetts Hall is the oldest surviving building at Harvard College, the first institution of higher learning in the British colonies in America, and second oldest academic building in the United States after the Wren Building at the College of William & Mary. Massachusetts Hall was designed by Harvard Presidents John Leverett and his successor Benjamin Wadsworth. It was erected between 1718 and 1720 in Harvard Yard. Massachusetts Hall, as Harvard's oldest extant dormitory, has housed many influential people. Founding fathers who lived in Massachusetts Hall include John Adams, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Elbridge Gerry, and James Otis.

Laos is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, bordered by Burma and People's Republic of China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south and Thailand to the west.

In Laos today there are over forty-seven recognized ethnic groups, with the Lao Loum comprising the majority group. As an inland crossroads of Southeast Asia the political history of Laos has been complicated by frequent warfare and colonial conquests by European and regional rivals. As a result, Laos today has cultural influence from France, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia. Laos developed its culture and customs as the inland crossroads of trade and migration in Southeast Asia over millennia. As of 2012 Laos has a population of roughly 6.4 million spread over 236,800 km2 (91,400 sq miles), yielding one of the lowest population densities in Asia. Yet the country of Laos has an official count of over forty-seven ethnicities divided into 149 sub-groups and 80 different languages. In Southeast Asia, traditional Lao culture is considered one of the Indic cultures (along with Burma, Thailand and Cambodia). Laos is geographically isolated and mountainous, bounded by the Annamite Range in the east, forming a traditional political and cultural boundary with Vietnam (a more Chinese influenced Sinitic culture).\n\nQuestion: where is laos in world map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Alpine arch generally extends from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and Vienna at the beginning of the Pannonian Basin. According to Cato and several Roman authors, the Alps formed the \"walls of Italy\". In 264 BC, Roman Italy extended from the Arno and Rubicon rivers of the centre-north to the entire south.

East of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, either via the Rio Grande or via one of several rivers (the South Platte River, the North Platte River, the Republican River, the Arkansas River, the Cimarron River, or the Canadian River) which eventually feed the Mississippi River along the way. Colorado also has three significant endorheic basins: the San Luis Closed Basin in the San Luis Valley, and the Bear Creek Basin and the White Woman Basin spanning the Colorado-Kansas border north and south of the Arkansas River. Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. It flows west to east starting in Colorado and dumping into the Mississippi River. Its length of 1,469 miles allows it to flow through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.

His critically acclaimed debut album My Aim Is \n\n Blood & Chocolate is the eleventh studio album by the British rock singer and songwriter Elvis Costello, released in the United Kingdom as Demon Records XFIEND 80, and in the United States as Columbia 40518. The recording of Blood & Chocolate was troubled, as the relationship between Costello and the Attractions had deteriorated during sessions for King of America. of Costello's albums since the mid-1990s, including 1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration Painted From Memory, 2001's Anne Sofie von Otter collaboration For the Stars and 2003's North. In 2001 Costello formed a new backing band consisting of Nieve, Attractions drummer Pete Thomas, and bassist Davey Faragher. Nieve played piano, organ and other keyboard instruments on most of Costello's projects over the next ten years, including the albums This Year's Model (1978), Imperial Bedroom (1982) and Blood & Chocolate (1986). On the 1984 Costello album Goodbye Cruel World and its accompanying tour, he was credited as \"Maurice Worm.\" He wrote some material on The Attractions' Costello-less album, Mad About the Wrong Boy under the name Norman Brain, in collaboration with his then girlfriend, Fay Hart. In the mid-1980s, Costello began to work less frequently with the Attractions and stopped working with them entirely between \n\n inspirations for his jangly guitar sound. In 2011, Costello appeared on Sesame Street to perform a parody of \"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes\", entitled \"(A Monster Went and) Ate My Red 2\". In the song, Costello sings with Elmo, who is dressed in Costello's style, in a performance described by Huffington Post as \"awesome\".\n\nQuestion: where was elvis costello born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ömnögovi includes several well known tourist areas, including the Flaming Cliffs, Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park and Khongoryn Els - The Singing Sand Dunes. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East. The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent. A large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west-southwest through the Taklamakan Desert in Western China, the Thar Desert in Western India and Iranian Plateau into the Arabian Desert in the Arabian Peninsula. It is a string of oases along the northern edges of the Qilian Mountains and Altyn-Tagh, with the high and desolate Tibetan Plateau further to the south. To the north are the Longshou, Heli and Mazong Mountains separating it from the arid Badain Jaran Desert, Gobi Desert and the cold steppes of the Mongolian Plateau. Mountain ranges separate the Ordos from the Gobi Desert north and east of the Yellow River. In the south and east, the Great Wall of China separates the Ordos from fertile loess lands.

The Convention adopted a new Constitution which provided for a republic with a much stronger national government in a federal framework, including an effective executive in a check-and-balance system with the judiciary and legislature. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the proposed new government. The new administration under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789. James Madison spearheaded Congressional amendments to the Constitution as assurances to those cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the inalienable rights that formed a foundation for the revolution. The most basic features of republicanism anywhere are a representational government in which citizens elect leaders from among themselves for a predefined term, as opposed to a permanent ruling class or aristocracy, and laws are passed by these leaders for the benefit of the entire republic. In addition, unlike a direct or \"pure\" democracy in which the majority vote rules, a republic codifies in a charter or constitution a certain set of basic civil rights that is guaranteed to every citizen and cannot be overridden by majority rule. The American interpretation of \"republicanism\" was inspired by the Whig party in Great Britain which openly criticized \n\n The United States Constitution established through the supremacy clause that the United States Constitution and federal law takes precedent over state law. These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. The law of the United States consists of many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law, of which the most important is the United States Constitution, the foundation of the federal government of the United States.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does the us follow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has two alternating capitals on the two occupied reservations: Irving at Cattaraugus Reservation, and Jimerson Town near Salamanca on the Allegany Reservation. The government of this tribe was established in 1848 by a Constitutional Convention of Seneca Indians residing on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Territories in present-day New York. The Seneca Nation of Indians Constitution established a tri-partite governing structure based on general elections of 16 Councilors, three Executives (President, Treasurer, Clerk), and Court justices (Surrogates and Peacemakers).

The unexpected tendency of consumers to spend their legacy currency, rather than exchange it at banks, led to temporary shortages of euro small change, with some consumers being given change in legacy currency. A coffee bar in Italy that took advantage of the transition to raise coffee prices by a third was ordered to pay compensation to customers.

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. Spanish, spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English: Samoan and Chamorro are recognized by American Samoa and Guam, respectively; Carolinian and Chamorro are recognized by the Northern Mariana Islands; Spanish is an official language of Puerto Rico. Spanish is the first official language of Puerto Rico, while English is the second official language. Spanish has been an official language in Puerto Rico since it was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. English was introduced as an official language when the United States acquired Puerto Rico as a territory after the Spanish–American War and the Treaty of Paris in 1898.

Bulldogs are typically stocky, powerful, square-built animals with large, strong, brachycephalic-type muzzles. It is believed bulldogs were developed during the 16th century in the Elizabethan era from the larger mastiffs, as smaller, more compact dogs were better suited for baiting. Pit bull is a term used in the United States for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers, while in other countries such as the United Kingdom the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed. Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and occasionally the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. If kept, they are usually beef breeds. Originally bred for bull-fighting. (See also MINIATURE BULL TERRIER DOGS; PIT BULL TERRIERS; STAFFORDSHIRE BULL TERRIERS.) The Boxer is a medium to large, short-haired breed of dog, developed in Germany. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group. The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. According to the AKC's website, though, the boxer is now the 11th-most popular dog breed in the United States. Bullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in England in the mid-1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff.\n\nQuestion: where do american bulldogs originate from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The book provides an overview of the historical and philosophical debates that have continued throughout the history of evolutionary theory, and carry on to this day in debates surrounding the merits of gene-centric selection and group selection models. The book is particularly critical of the popular science author Richard Dawkins, claiming that he presents a brand of evolutionary theory that portrays natural selection as acting at the level of the individual gene to the exclusion of group selection models which state that it could also act at the level of organisms or species. In the opening scene, Richard Dawkins responds very precisely to what he views as a misrepresentation of his first book, The Selfish Gene. Dawkins has examined this issue throughout his career and focused much of his documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin on this very issue. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work. Darwin, for example, proposed five separate theories \n\n manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins described himself as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction. The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas. Popular Science author Brian Clegg reviewed the book and described it as brilliantly identifying how Dawkins' views sit within the latest theories on evolution.\n\nQuestion: which dawkins book to read first?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Nikola Tesla faced resistance and eventually became forgotten over time for several reasons. One major reason was his unconventional and visionary ideas that often challenged the established scientific and economic interests of his time. Tesla's inventions and concepts, such as wireless transmission of energy and alternating current (AC), threatened the financial interests of the prominent figures in the electricity industry, such as Thomas Edison. This led to conflicts and competition that worked against Tesla's recognition and acceptance. Furthermore, Tesla's eccentric personality and unconventional lifestyle also contributed to his resistance and subsequent downfall. Tesla's focus on his scientific pursuits rather than commercialization hindered his ability to market and promote his inventions effectively. This setback was a significant blow to Tesla's reputation and legacy, as it showcased his inability to turn his extraordinary ideas into practical and profitable ventures. Moreover, Tesla's contributions were overshadowed by the success and popularization of other inventors' work, such as Thomas Edison and his direct current (DC) system. Edison engaged in a bitter rivalry with Tesla, which influenced public opinion and further marginalized Tesla's achievements. Over time, the lack of recognition, financial struggles, and overshadowing by competing inventors led to Tesla's fading from the public eye.\n\nQuestion: what was nikola tesla inventions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They are one of two principal ethnic groups in Belgium, the other being the French-speaking Walloons. \"Flemish\" was historically a geographical term, as all inhabitants of the medieval County of Flanders in modern-day Belgium, France, and the Netherlands were referred to as \"Flemings\", irrespective of their ethnicity or language. The contemporary region of Flanders comprises a part of this historical county, as well as parts of the medieval duchy of Brabant and the medieval county of Loon, where the modern Flemish ethnic group and culture gradually formed. The Flemish movement has inspired the growth of Flemish nationalist political parties such as the Volksunie (People's Union) which split into different parties including the Vlaams Blok (succeeded by the Vlaams Belang), the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and FlemishProgressives. After a period of marginalisation, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In the history of art and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and Netherlandish are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"Early Netherlandish painting\", and it is not uncommon to see Mosan art categorized as Flemish art. Today, Flanders' minority residents include 170 nationalities—the largest groups speaking French, English, Berber, Turkish, Arabic, Spanish, Italian and Polish. The sense of \"Flemish\" identity increased significantly after the Belgian Revolution. Prior to this, the term \"Flemings\" in the Dutch language was in first place used for the inhabitants of the former County of Flanders.\n\nQuestion: where did flemish people come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Wing-Chun kung fu teacher, Jeet Kune Do founder, and Chinese/Hollywood movie legend Bruce Lee. Hong Kong cinema historian Bey Logan says Lewis was the original pick of Bruce Lee for the villain Colt in Way of the Dragon, but that Lee and Lewis had a falling out before the film and thus Chuck Norris was tapped instead. \"He had the best doctors, and they think they did a good job of getting it all out,\" said Dennis Nackord, Lewis' senior black belt.

Despite a provision of his will that denounced organized religion and specifically forbade burial near a church or religious meeting house, his remains were taken to the City Tavern for friends and dignitaries to pay their respects, then a military escort took his remains to Christ Church, where after a brief Anglican service, Lee was buried in the churchyard in an unmarked grave. Lee died on 11 May 2012 at the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals Fung Yiu King Hospital from multiple organ failure.

Franklin's father wanted him to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although \"his parents talked of the church as a career\" for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten. Benjamin Franklin ( –  April 17, 1790) was an American polymath who was active as a writer, scientist, inventor, statesman, diplomat, printer, publisher and political philosopher. Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter and signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first United States postmaster general.

Franklin would begin to consider men and women as more intellectually equal later in his life, but he did not take this approach to his own children and grandchildren.

It includes the island of Great Britain, the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. The United Kingdom consists of four constituent countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom is a highly developed country with a market-orientated economy and is a member of the Group of 7 (formerly G8) leading industrialised countries. In 2017, the UK was the eleventh-largest goods \n\n The early modern predecessors of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Ireland and later including Scotland) included both an accessory union and aeque principali union. The Lordship and later Kingdom of Ireland were ruled separately in a personal union with the Kingdom of England (and Scotland after 1603; Great Britain after 1707) until they were legally united by the Acts of Union 1800, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The majority of England's trade is outside the UK, but the rest of the UK still accounts for more than 10% of its imports and exports. In a 2016 referendum, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, colloquially known as Brexit. United Kingdom has an established church in two of the four nations of the country; the Anglican Church of England, which the head of state is the head of the church in one, and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland who plays a notable role of the other. Another sizable difference between the U.S. and the UK is the piety of followers, as the UK much more secular than the U.S. A Gallup poll in 2015 reported that 41% of Americans said they regularly attend religious services, compared to just 10% of Britons.\n\nQuestion: what countries included in the uk?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since the opening of the People's Republic of China, Mandarin, the official language in PRC and Republic of China (Taiwan) has become increasingly prevalent. Many Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are also learning Mandarin and to a far lesser extent Cantonese. In New York City in 2002, Mandarin was spoken as a native language among only 10% of Chinese speakers but was predicted to replace Cantonese as the lingua franca among Chinese speakers. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. 1.34 billion spoke some variety of Mandarin Chinese as their first language, accounting for 71% of the country's population. According to the 2019 edition of Ethnologue, 904,000,000 people in China spoke some variety of Mandarin as their first language in 2017. Standard Chinese, known in China as Putonghua, based on the Mandarin dialect of Beijing, is the official national spoken language for the mainland and serves as a lingua franca within the Mandarin-speaking regions (and, to a lesser extent, across the other regions of mainland China). For example, Tibetan has official status within the Tibet Autonomous Region and Mongolian has official status within Inner Mongolia.

After graduating from Williamsville High School (now Williamsville South High School), Abercrombie pursued studies in sociology at Union College in Schenectady, New York, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1959. At the university he befriended and attended classes with President Barack Obama's parents, Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr. To support himself as a graduate student, Abercrombie worked as a waiter at Chuck's Steak House in Waikīkī, locker desk clerk at the Central YMCA, custodian at Mother Rice Preschool, construction apprentice program director, elementary school teacher, and a college lecturer. Ann Dunham attended the University of Hawaii, and while attending a Russian language class, she met Barack Obama Sr. in 1960, a graduate student from Kenya. She was the mother of Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. Dunham was known as Stanley Ann Dunham through high school, then as Ann Dunham, Ann Obama, Ann Soetoro, a.k.a. She also attended the University of Washington in Seattle from 1961 to 1962. He dropped-out of the school, returning home and enrolling himself at Thornton Community College, while working part time as an auxiliary clerk at the American Medical Association.

The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, Chinese characters have developed from logograms that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (regional speech). Cantonese is still the most commonly-used language in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Hokkien has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language alongside Mandarin. Continuing previous policies, the People’s Republic of China sought to further standardize a common language, now dubbed Putonghua (\"Common Speech\"), for national and political unity. In aims of reducing the country’s approximately 80% illiteracy rate, the \"Decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and State Council Concerning Elimination of Illiteracy\" of March 1956 solidified the Communist Party’s plans to reform the country's traditional characters to a simplified writing system. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. In the 1930s a standard national language was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and one of the official languages of Singapore. Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.\n\nQuestion: what is the primary language of china?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization.

In the first volume of Kotkin's biography, he detailed how the world that Stalin was born into molded his personality and shaped his views as he developed into the person who would in turn mold the Bolshevik party and shape the Soviet government, both of which he would come to dominate. After 1945 Stalin did not directly engage in any wars. Stalin continued his totalitarian rule until his death in 1953. Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, dies of a stroke.

In 2006, exports from Queensland totaled A$49.4 billion. During the early 20th century, agricultural produce began to make up a larger share of Australian exports to China, including a growing demand for Australian butter and wheat. Meanwhile, Australian demand for silk and other textiles increased during the early 20th century. World War II disrupted trade between Australia and China. In the post-war decades, wool became an important Australian commodity imported by China. From the 1960s, however, agricultural shortages in China led to heavy imports of Australian wheat.

According to tradition, Silwan originated at the time of Saladin in the twelfth century on Ras al-Amud, on the south-west slope  of  the  Mount of Olives,  then in the early twentieth  century, expanding  across  the  Kidron Valley (known to locals as Wadi Sitti Maryam or the Valley of St.Mary) eventually incorporating all of  the Southeast Hill. The Tower of David is an ancient citadel located near the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem. The strong bulwarks still seen today surrounding the base of the tower are believed to have been built by king Herod, in memorial of his brother, and was formerly named the Tower of Phasael (מגדל פצאל). During the Jewish war with Rome, Simon bar Giora made the tower his place of residence. dozens of towns, the restoration of large agriculture, and the construction of hundreds of churches, cathedrals, and castles.

The unbroken length of wall uncovered by Avigad's dig runs 65 m long and is preserved in places to a height of 3.3 m. It was long believed that the city in this period was confined to the fortified, narrow hill running to the south of the Temple Mount known as the City of David. Avigad's dig demonstrated that by the late eighth century the city had expanded to include the hill to the west of the Temple Mount. According to Jewish tradition, as expressed in the Tanakh, Jerusalem remained a Jebusite city until the rise of David, who conquered Jebus, renamed it City of David and started expanding it. Solomon, David's son, built the First Temple on the hilltop rising right above the city he had inherited, the Temple Mount, and then extended the city walls in order to protect the temple.

Her work has been exhibited widely at venues including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, the New Museum in New York and many others. Her work was included in the 2009 exhibition “The Pictures Generation” (of which she is considered to be a member) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, alongside the work of her peers and contemporaries, including Cindy Sherman and Robert Longo, with whom she cofounded Hallwalls in Buffalo, New York in 1974, as well as work by Barbara Kruger, Richard Prince, John Baldessari, Louise Lawler and Sherrie Levine, among others. Many of them, like Dwyer, Sherman and Longo, were associated with Hallwalls in Buffalo. Their early work, in particular, is typically characterized by their critical appropriation of images from the mainstream media. Dwyer and her contemporaries approached the image-saturated pop cultural landscape with a sense of suspicion and irony, even black comedy. An example is \"Suzy Lake As Patty Hearst\", a project Lake made in collaboration with Bill Jones, featuring the artist as the eponymous Hearst. American artist Cindy Sherman has cited Lake's photo-performance as an influence on her work. Suzy Lake has twenty-five portfolios of her artwork.

He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. Aristotle has been called \"the father of logic\", \"the father of biology\", \"the father of political science\", \"the father of zoology\", \"the father of embryology\", \"the father of natural law\", \"the father of scientific method\", \"the father of rhetoric\", \"the father of psychology\", \"the father of realism\", \"the father of criticism\", \"the father of individualism\", \"the father of teleology\", and \"the father of meteorology\". following six works: Aristotle's Metaphysics has some points of overlap with the works making up the Organon but is not traditionally considered part of it; additionally there are works on logic attributed, with varying degrees of plausibility, to Aristotle that were not known to the Peripatetics. Aristotle introduced what may be called a scientific method. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: empiricism. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that \n\n survived, none of it intended for publication.

It drains an area of 13539 sqmi in four U.S. states: Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Rising in two branches in New York state's Catskill Mountains, the river flows 419 mi into Delaware Bay where its waters enter the Atlantic Ocean near Cape May in New Jersey and Cape Henlopen in Delaware. Not including Delaware Bay, the river's length including its two branches is 388 mi. The Delaware River is one of nineteen \"Great Waters\" recognized by the America's Great Waters Coalition. The Delaware Basin occupies Delaware and Sullivan counties and portions of several of the adjacent counties. The Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, more commonly called the Delaware Canal, runs for 60 mi parallel to the right bank of the Delaware River from the entry locks near the mouth of the Lehigh River and terminal end of the Lehigh Canal at Easton south to Bristol. The river's East Branch begins at Grand Gorge in Delaware County. These two branches flow west and merge near Hancock in Delaware County, and the combined waters flow as the Delaware River south.

Under the present Constitution of Japan, the Emperor is \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\". Other members of the Imperial Family perform ceremonial and social duties, but have no role in the affairs of government. The duties as an Emperor are passed down the line to their male children. This Japanese monarchy is said to be the oldest continuous hereditary monarchy in the world. The Imperial House recognizes 126 monarchs, beginning with the legendary Emperor Jimmu (traditionally dated to 11 February 660 BC), and continuing up to the current emperor, Naruhito. Unlike most other monarchies, Japan has no crown for its ruler. This ancient rite was held in Kyoto, the former capital of Japan, until 1990 when the enthronement ceremony for Emperor Akihito took place at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. The ceremony is not public, and the regalia are generally seen only by the emperor himself and a few Shinto priests. However, an account in Time from the enthronement of Akihito's father Hirohito in 1928 reveals a few \n\n First is a three-hour ceremony in which the emperor ritually informed his ancestors that he had assumed the throne. This was followed by the enthronement itself, which took place in an enclosure called the Takamikura, which contained a great square pedestal upholding three octagonal pedestals topped by a simple chair. A simple shaku (a flat wooden baton or sceptre) was presented to the monarch, who faced his Prime Minister standing in an adjacent courtyard, representing the Japanese people. Some of its powers are nominally exercised by the Emperor with the binding \"advice and approval\" of the Cabinet. Instead, the Emperor represents the State and appoints other high officials in the name of the State, in which the Japanese people hold sovereignty.\n\nQuestion: what kind of monarchy does japan have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Romney's paternal great-grandparents practiced plural marriage, and went to Mexico in 1884 after the 1878 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. United States that upheld laws banning polygamy. Subsequent generations of Romney's paternal lineage have been monogamous, and none of his mother's Mormon ancestors were polygamists. Romney's father, George W. Romney, was a patriarch in the LDS Church. Romney's wife, Ann, converted to Mormonism before they were married in 1969.

Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving approximately 135,000 dead; another 130,000 would die from radiation sickness and other bomb-related illnesses in the following five years. Supporters of the bombings argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives \n\n The city of Sendai was the largest population and commercial center of the Tohoku region of northern Honshu island, but lacked specific targets of strategic military significance. The industrial city of Kamaishi was bombed on July 14, 1945, which was also the first air raid experienced in Miyagi Prefecture during the war. The first experience of Sendai with bombing was on March 10, 1945, when three B-29 Superfortress bombers from the Tokyo Air Raid dropped their bomb load on Mount Zaō for unknown reasons, killing 34 civilians, and an additional two B-29 bombers attacked Sendai Airport causing minor damage. On May 25, 1945, a photo-reconnaissance B-29 overflew Sendai at an altitude of 8000 feet, compiling a detailed map of the downtown area of the city. On July 10, 1945, another B-29 made an over flight of Sendai, this time dropping propaganda leaflets warning the residents of the city of its imminent destruction. After securing airfields in Saipan and Guam in the summer of 1944, the United States Army Air Forces undertook an intense strategic bombing campaign, using incendiary bombs, burning Japanese cities in an effort to pulverize Japan's industry and shatter its morale. Approximately 350,000–500,000 civilians died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of the incendiary bombing campaign on Japan. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945. The Bombing of Sendai in World War II (仙台空襲) on July 10, 1945, was part of the strategic bombing campaign waged by the United States against the civilian population and military targets during the Japan home islands campaign in the closing stages of World War II.\n\nQuestion: what places in japan were bombed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This has allowed China to rely on savings-financed investments for economic growth. However, because low returns also dampens consumer spending, household expenditures account for \"a smaller share of GDP in China than in any other major economy\". At China's 1.6% inflation rate, this is a \"high real-interest rate compared to other major economies\". China is considering taking policy steps to double average wages over the five years from 2011, and several Chinese provinces raised the legal minimum wage. State media also stated that higher wages will help boost domestic consumption and help move China away from a reliance on exports for growth towards an economy more driven by domestic consumption. Economist Andy Xie said that there is ample scope for increased wages in China due to its superior infrastructure as compared to competing, low-wage alternative nations. In recent years Guangxi's economy has languished behind that of its wealthy neighbor and twin, Guangdong. Chinese people escalating demand for consumption, increasing demand for consumption comes from two major factors in China. As China’s living standards are rising with the economic growth, Chinese consumers’ shopping habits have changed, more and more consumers are able and willing to spend more on goods and services.\n\nQuestion: what type of economy exists in china?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Angered by this, and knowing of Mordechai's Jewish nationality, Haman convinced Ahasuerus to allow him to have all of the Jews in the Persian empire killed. The plot was foiled by Queen Esther, the king's recent wife, who was herself a Jew. This enraged the king, who was further angered when (after leaving the room briefly and returning) he discovered Haman had fallen on Esther's couch, intending to beg mercy from Esther, \n\n new queen from a selection of beautiful young women from throughout the empire (2:1–4). Among these women is a Jewish orphan named Esther, who was raised by her cousin or uncle, Mordecai (2:5–7). The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is recorded (2:21–23). Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him (3:2–5). In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, Vashti, refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. The king's chief adviser, Haman, is offended by Esther's cousin and guardian, Mordecai, and gets permission from the king to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. Esther foils the plan, and wins permission from the king for the Jews to kill their enemies, and they do so.

Both traditional sports such as sumo and martial arts, and Western imports like basketball and association football, are popular with both participants and spectators. The Nippon Professional Baseball league has been Japan's largest professional sports competition in terms of television ratings and spectators. Association football has gained wide popularity since the founding of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992. In 2021, the Nagoya Diamond Dolphins became the first top-tier professional Japanese sports club to sign on to a climate change initiative, as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea. In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country.

On my return two days later the frantic mother begged me to do something the patient was desperately ill, was given oxygen all the time and had had a blood transfusion that morning. The doctor did not communicate with me ; I never saw him ; he had made no comment to the parents, so probably he thinks his treatment triumphed in spite of mine. Late one evening this spring a frantic call came from a father who had heard of the last case. The hospital people would not co-operate at all, so she was taken home ; almost died on arrival but revived with oxygen and Kali-bi. set this right within a few hours. The eruption has not returned as yet. Her mother's case worked out to Zinc and I decided to try it on her. On June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. Medical interventions continued; Dee Dee had some of Gypsy's saliva glands treated with Botox, then extracted altogether, to control her drooling, which Gypsy later claimed her mother had induced by using a topical anesthetic to numb her gums before doctor visits. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections. Suspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him. Flasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. The next year, Gypsy arranged and paid for Godejohn to meet her mother in Springfield. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan. Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did.

Sometime after \n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Childhood of Gypsy\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems.

Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan. Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. Kim Blanchard (no relation), who had called the deputy sheriffs to the house the night before, said, \"What have I been believing? However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. None of them would pay for her funeral, and her father and stepmother ultimately flushed her ashes down the toilet. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. In popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Television\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.

Although they lived in independent city-states, they spoke a common language (Latin), held common religious beliefs, and shared a sense of kinship, expressed in the myth that all Latins descend from Latinus. Latinus was worshiped on Mons Albanus (Monte Albano) during an annual festival attended by all Latins, including those from Rome, one of the Latin states. Over time this—along with other factors that encouraged linguistic and cultural assimilation, such as political unity, frequent travel and commerce, military service, etc.—made Latin the predominant language throughout the western Mediterranean. Latin itself was subject to the same assimilatory tendencies, such that its varieties had probably become more uniform by the time the Western Empire fell in 476 than they had been before it. It is likely to have evolved over time, with some features not appearing until the late Empire. Because there are few phonetic transcriptions of the daily speech of these Latin speakers (to match, \n\n The Latins were originally an Italic tribe in ancient central Italy from Latium.

In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory. Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that hell is a place of punishment brought about by a person's self-exclusion from communion with God. Jonathan Kvanvig, in \n\n Protestants believe that the deceased leave their bodies and their spirit faces judgement for sin by God. Since all humans sin, the only way into Heaven is faith in Jesus Christ, who is both God's Son and God in human form. Protestantism differs from other World beliefs in that while it allows a distinct avenue for judgement by a Higher Power, passage into a comfortable eternal life cannot be earned, but happens due to the self-sacrifice of that Higher Power by Solo Fides. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints. The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.\n\nQuestion: what do christians believe about heaven hell and purgatory?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Linnaeus was born in Råshult, the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also \n\n The 12th edition of Systema Naturae was the last edition of Systema Naturae to be overseen by its author, Carl Linnaeus. Charles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Linnaeus had originally invented this system for botanical names in his 1753 work Species Plantarum, and presented it again in 1758 in the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae for more than 4,000 animal species. During the time of Linnaeus, there was an increasing amount of information on previously unknown plant and animal species, leading to a concept known as 'information overload.' In order to effectively organize and handle this wealth of information, Linnaeus created taxonomic systems, rules of nomenclature, and technical terminologies. By creating a standardized system for classifying and naming plants, Linnaeus provided botanists with a common language and framework for studying and categorizing different species. Additionally, Linnaeus's taxonomic system allowed for the comparison and classification of plants based on their shared characteristics and relationships. Furthermore, Linnaeus's development of technical terminologies provided researchers with specific vocabulary and descriptive terms to accurately communicate and document their observations.\n\nQuestion: who was carolus linnaeus?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He served both as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England. His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method or simply, the scientific method. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as Lord Chancellor. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon Baron Verulam, of Verulam, in the Peerage of England; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam. Bacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage, as Viscount St Alban, on 27 January 1621. —Francis Bacon (1605) The Advancement of Learning, Book 1, v, 8\" Francis Bacon (1561–1626) entered Trinity College, Cambridge in April 1573, where he applied himself diligently to the several sciences as then taught, and came to the conclusion that the methods employed and the results attained were alike erroneous; he learned to despise the current Aristotelian philosophy.

In each half-hour episode, Jamie Oliver creates three 'comfort food' dishes including snacks, mains and desserts. Jamie's Kitchen Australia is a 10 part Australian television show which premiered Thursday 14 September 2006 on Network Ten. The show stars international chef Jamie Oliver and Tobie Puttock. Based upon the original Jamie's Kitchen that aired in 2002 in the UK, 25 disadvantaged youth were selected to train and hopefully become part of the staff at the newly opened Fifteen restaurant in Melbourne. Fifteen was opened to the public from 22 September 2006. In 2005, British chef Jamie Oliver began a campaign to reduce unhealthy food choices in British schools and to get children more enthused about eating lower calorie nutritious food instead. Oliver's efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that children enjoyed eating.\n\nQuestion: what is jamie oliver children names?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dutch is also spoken and official in Aruba, Brussels, Curaçao, Flanders, Sint Maarten and Suriname. It is a West Germanic, Low Franconian language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardized in the 16th century. Several dialects of Low Saxon (Nedersaksisch in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Another Dutch dialect granted the status of regional \n\nCape Dutch, a direct transplantation of European Dutch to Southern Africa, and ; 'Hottentot Dutch', a pidgin that descended from 'Foreigner Talk' and ultimately from the Dutch pidgin spoken by slaves, via a hypothetical Dutch creole.

Afrikaans) as putatively beneath official Dutch standards included geradbraakt, gebroken and onbeschaafd Hollands (\"mutilated/broken/uncivilised Dutch\"), as well as verkeerd Nederlands (\"incorrect Dutch\"). While in control of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried took some measures to encourage assimilation of their national languages, but in neither case did their rule last long enough for either language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions. Dutch (Nederlands ) is a West Germanic language spoken by about 25 million people as a first language and 5 million people as a second language, constituting most of the population of the Netherlands (where it is the only official language countrywide) and about 60% of the population of Belgium (as one of three official languages). Outside the Low Countries, it is the native language of the majority of the population of Suriname where it also holds an official status, as it does in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, which\n\nQuestion: where did dutch language come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Peru has become a popular destination for many travelers of all ages. Although relatively safe, when traveling to anywhere in the world, I would advise taking certain precautions in the unlikely event something unexpected happens while abroad. Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home. Bring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. Medical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. PassportAll travelers are required to have a valid passport (http: //travel.state.gov/passport). If you do not have a passport, get one quickly. Check the expiration date to make sure your passport is valid at least 6 months beyond your return date to the US and that there are blank pages available for entry/departure stamps. Be sure to have your passport with you during travel to and from Peru, although a Visa is not necessary. Make sure you notify your bank of travels before you leave, and make a copy of all your cards to store with your passport copy while traveling. I’ve had an ATM eat my card more than once while traveling, and in many small shops/towns, credit cards are a bit harder to use and will be harder to use as a primary means of currency.Also, it is a good idea to leave copies of such important documents with someone you trust at home in case of emergency. Leave a rough itinerary with someone you trust at home, and keep in touch with them throughout your trip. Getting to Cusco can be difficult, and most travelers will first arrive in Lima, Peru in route to Cusco. Due to flight schedules, it is likely you may spend a night, or at least several hours in this airport. Some people chose to sleep waiting for their connection, but you are not allowed thru the security line until much closer to your flight time, so if you are solo, take care to be aware of your surroundings and keep your luggage close by. Many travel agents will be overly friendly offering tours and hotels upon arrival, sometimes rather aggressively. Although I cannot say much for the deals they offer, know that it is extremely easy, and probably more relaxing and cheaper, to find tourists offices all around Cusco and in most tourists towns throughout Peru. Collect your luggage and head into the parking lot to escape. There, taxis will be waiting. If you do not know where you are staying for the first night, the Plaza del Arms is the center of Cusco’s touristy area and an easy place to find a coffee shop with tourist’s maps that will mark several hostels and restaurants to help get you oriented for your first night. High Altitude:If you choose to fly into Cusco from Lima, the first thing most travelers will notice is the effect of the high altitude. Cusco is situated at 11,151 feet above sea level. Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival).Medication Options: Diamox (acetazolamide)- Altitude sickness, Avoid alcohol and sleeping pills (Diamox can be used as a sleeping pill, take upon arrival). Attire:Cusco is in the mountains and the average temperature during the daytime is 60° F and 40° F during the nighttime. You can check www.weather.com for an idea of Cusco temperatures before leaving. A raincoat may be a good idea, particularly if you are there during the rainy season (November-March). If you will travel to Machu Picchu, consider bringing a short sleeve shirt and shorts or jeans. The temperature will be warmer than Cusco with considerable humidity. Pickpockets:Although Cusco is a relatively safe part of Peru, common sense and awareness always helps keep you safe. Be particularly cautious for theft of money, cell phones, laptops, cameras and documents. Be especially cautious if visiting local markets or downtown Lima. However, always be aware of pickpockets, especially during festivals. Keep your bags/purses zipped up and if in crowds, in front of you so somebody cannot reach in and remove any of your valuables.San Blas: funky little artsy part of Cusco that is well worth a trip. Electricity:Because Peru uses 220 volts instead of 110 volts and a different electrical plug, an electrical adapter and voltage converter (transformer) will be required in Peru if you bring an electrical device from the US. Transportation:Taxis are relatively inexpensive in Cusco. However, if traveling independently, always take secure taxis or call one if late at night. Settle on a price to your destination before leaving or entering the taxi, most are slightly negotiable. Locals generally are willing to tell you the appropriate price. If taking a taxi from a hostel, ask the front desk owner to point out a secure taxi if it is late at night, and if possible, travel with a friend. Many are happy to help.If taking a bus or van to a near-by town, such as Pisac, try to find one in good repair, as these roads are rather full of twists and turns. Drugs:Any street drugs such as cocaine and pot are offered fairly frequently on the streets of Cusco. Remember that these drugs are illegal and penalties for foreigners can be harsh. Money:You may exchange money in Peru, but it is easiest in larger cities like Lima and Cusco. Bank ATM’s offer the best rates. Hotels can exchange money, but the rates are generally not as good. Credit cards can also be used in the major cities, but beware you may have to pay a fee or percentage for using the card abroad. If traveling to rural settings, be sure to have some cash in local currency (nuevos soles). Phone:Your cell phone may operate in Peru; however check with your service plan to assess charges. Local cell phones can be purchased quite cheaply in most markets in Peru, and you simply purchase minutes, as you need them. If staying in the country for a few weeks, this may be a great option not only for safety (sketch cab?

The series tells the tale of the crew of the starship Enterprise and its five-year mission \"to boldly go where no man has gone before.\" The original 1966–69 television series featured William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy, James Doohan as Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott, Nichelle Nichols as Uhura, George Takei as Hikaru Sulu, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov.

Critics cite an overdone focus on Kirk as the glorified hero, often leaving Picard and others in downplayed roles.

In 1866 Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years. Swedish taxation is controlled by the Riksdag. Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its \"popular movements\" (Folkrörelser), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements.

Jones spent his teenage years in Akron, Ohio, where he began singing country music tunes on a radio \n\n on WJW. By 1935 his pursuit of a musical career took him to WBZ radio in Boston, Massachusetts, where he met musician/songwriter Bradley Kincaid, who gave him the nickname \"Grandpa Jones\" when he was 22 years old, because of his off-stage grumpiness at early-morning radio shows. Jones liked the name and decided to create a stage persona based around it. Later in life, he lived in Mountain View, Arkansas.

William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the history of the English language, and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare's writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world’s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. Shakespeare's works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre. Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature (with Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world's greatest plays),  and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language. Specifically, in plays like Hamlet, Shakespeare \"integrated characterization with plot,\" such that if the main character was different in any way, the plot would be totally changed. Through his soliloquies, Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character's inner motivations and conflict (up until Shakespeare, soliloquies were often used by playwrights to \"introduce [characters], convey information, provide an exposition or reveal plans\"). It has inspired many other writers—from Johann \n\n His plays exhibited \"spectacular violence, with loose and episodic plotting, and with a mingling of comedy with tragedy\".

Immigration is increasingly seen as necessary to sustain the country's population. Both the USSR and Russia (under Vladimir Putin), have cancelled exports of energy supplies to buyers who have gone against national objectives. Nevertheless, Russia's power in the international arena correlates to the demand for the resources that it delivers. Much of the Russian economy went through uncertainty following the end of the Soviet Union. Russia has the largest production of natural gas in the world. Oil production by Russia has increased drastically, especially over the early-2000s.

Gulf Hagas is one of 14 National Natural Landmarks in the State of Maine, and is open to the public for a fee during the regular season.

Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the Jewish–Roman wars of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter. When sacrifices were offered in ancient times, they were offered as a fulfillment of Biblical commandments. Since there is no longer a Temple, modern religious Jews instead pray or give tzedakah instead to atone for their sins as the korban would have accomplished. According to Orthodox Judaism, the coming of the messiah will not remove the requirement to keep the 613 commandments, and when the Temple is rebuilt, sacrifices will be offered again. Animal sacrifice has occurred in almost all cultures, from the Hebrews to the Greeks and Romans to the Yoruba. This tradition accounts for the slaughter of more than 100 million animals in only two days of Eid. Most religions condemn the practice of human sacrifices, and present day laws generally treat them as a criminal matter. Marcus Borg notes that animal sacrifice in Second Temple Judaism was not a \"payment for sin,\" but \n\n the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans, the Jewish practice of offering korbanot stopped for all intents and purposes. Despite subsequent intermittent periods of small Jewish groups offering the traditional sacrifices on the Temple Mount, the practice effectively ended.\n\nQuestion: when did the jews stop making animal sacrifices?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His government, following the vigorous leadership of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, assumed the debts of the states (the debt holders received federal bonds), created the Bank of the United States to stabilize the financial system, and set up a uniform system of tariffs (taxes on imports) and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure.

In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent Ottoman Empire. However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. East Thrace has an area of 23,764 km2 (3 percent of Turkey's land area), slightly smaller than Sardinia, and a population of about 16-17 million people or about 20 percent of the total Turkish population (in 2021); the population density is around 430 people/km2, compared to about 80 people/km2 for Asiatic Turkey, which is also called Anatolia or Asia Minor. The two continents are separated by the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus (collectively known as the Turkish Straits) and the Sea of Marmara, a route of about 361 km. European Turkey is bordered on the west by Greece for 212 km and on the north by Bulgaria for 269 km, with the Aegean Sea to the south-west and the Black Sea to the north-east. Azerbaijan, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey all have territory in both Asia and Europe. Armenia and Cyprus are entirely in Western Asia but are socio-politically European countries and members of the Council of Europe, with Cyprus also being a member of the European Union. The region is bounded by the Turkish Straits to the northwest, the Black Sea to the north, the Armenian Highlands to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean seas through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the Balkan peninsula of Southeast Europe.

The kingdom consolidated around the Kingdom of Sardinia, with which several states voluntarily united to form the Kingdom of Italy. Others polities, such as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Papal States, were conquered and annexed. Formally, the union in each territory was sanctioned by a popular referendum where people were formally asked if they agreed to have as their new ruler Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia and his legitimate heirs. Italy became a nation-state belatedly on 17 March 1861, when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the House of Savoy, which ruled over Piedmont. The architects of Italian unification were Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and national hero. In 1866, Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck offered Victor Emmanuel II an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. The victory against Austria allowed Italy to annex Venice. Pope Pius IX, a longtime rival of Italian kings, stated he had been made a \"prisoner\" inside the Vatican walls and refused to cooperate with the royal administration. This phenomenon, known in Italian as Trasformismo (roughly translatable in English as \"transformism\"—in a satirical newspaper, the PM was depicted as a chameleon), effectively removed political differences in Parliament, which was dominated by an undistinguished liberal bloc with a landslide majority until after World War I. Cavour died unexpectedly in June 1861, at 50, and most of the many promises that he made to regional authorities to induce them to join the newly unified Italian kingdom were ignored. The new Kingdom of Italy was structured by renaming the old Kingdom of Sardinia and annexing all the new provinces into its structures.\n\nQuestion: what type of government was formed when italy unified?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. in the Egyptian language dating to the Second Dynasty (28th century BC). The Egyptian hieroglyphs had been well known to scholars of the ancient world for centuries, but few had made any attempts to understand them. But Kircher had been the first to suggest that modern Coptic was a degenerate form \n\n Egyptian hieroglyphs were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt, used for writing the Egyptian language. The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet. Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems (the Greek and Aramaic scripts), the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and the Arabic script and possibly Brahmic family of scripts (through Aramaic). Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.\n\nQuestion: what was the ancient egyptians spoken language?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is located in the northwestern corner of the Precinct of Amon-Re at the Karnak complex. As Karnak became more prominent, pharaohs sought to leave their mark on the temple complex with their own monuments. The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. Although he began construction at Karnak during his rule, the association the city had with other gods drove Akhenaten to establish a new city and capital at Amarna for the Aten. The Great Temple of the Aten was located just north of the Central City and, as the largest temple dedicated to the Aten, was where Akhenaten fully established the proper cult and worship of the sun-disk. It is one of the most visited monuments of Ancient Egypt.

The leaders of the government recognized that the new measures were unpopular but necessary to contain the capital flight to other countries as Panamá where Cuban citizens traveled and imported items to resell on the island. Other measures were the facilities to the private sector to start to export and import, through state companies, resources to produce products and services on Cuba. The measure helped the Cuban government collect hard currency. Cuba's economic difficulties since the end of 2019 have resulted in shortages of goods in CUP and CUC stores, the opening of stores priced in US dollars and only accepting payment by cards backed by foreign currencies, the waiving of the 10% penalty for exchanging US dollars, the resumption of US dollars as unofficial medium of exchange, and the plunge in the value of the CUC below US$1 in unofficial street exchanges. Cuba has Cuban pesos (CUP) set at par with the US dollar. Henceforth the Cuban Peso became the only legal tender in Cuba, CUCs were converted at the rate of 24 CUP/CUC, and a single official exchange rate of 24 CUP/USD became applicable for both public and private transactions. Cuban passports are issued to citizens of Cuba to facilitate international travel. The cost of issue of this passport is about US$200 (CUC 200) and US$200 for every two years if one person lives in the United States.

Being the world's second largest aid donor, China uses economic policies to intervene internationally, providing developmental aid to over 100 countries, especially to nations sanctioned by Western governments. Both the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank lend more in volume to developing nations than all G7 nations combined and more than the World Bank. As China has grown, it has positioned itself to change international networks instead of remaining neutral and to protect its interests abroad, especially in a post-Cold War era. Chinese scholars have increasingly advocated for interventionist policies to protect Chinese interests in a globalized international community. To further rebalance power in the IMF, China appealed for changes that would transfer voting power to developing economies.

Étienne-Gabriel Morelly (1717–1778) was a French utopian thinker and novelist. An otherwise \"obscure tax official\", Morelly wrote two books on education and a critique of Montesquieu. James Madison proposed this governmental scheme so that the power and influence of each branch would be balanced by those of the others. These ideas originated in the work of French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu who described these concepts in his book The Spirit of the Laws (1748). Here Montesquieu explained how these checks on powers were efficient in preventing tyranny. John Locke (1632–1704) is often referred to as \"the philosopher of the American Revolution\" due to his work in the Social Contract and Natural Rights theories that underpinned the Revolution's political ideology. Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The Americans heavily relied on Montesquieu's analysis of the wisdom of the \"balanced\" British Constitution (mixed government) in writing the state and national constitutions. It was heavily imbued with Enlightenment principles and many of its philosophers became critics of church and state and promoters of rationality and progress. These philosophers would come to have a deep influence on the politics and ideologies of France and America. Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu (1689–1755) was a social commentator and political philosopher.

Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid, although descriptions vary depending on location. There are more than 100 \n\n The skunk ape, also known as the swamp ape and Florida Bigfoot, is a purported ape-like creature that is said to inhabit the forests and swamps of some southeastern United States, most notably in Florida. Like Bigfoot, a prominent subject within American folklore, supposed evidence of the existence of the skunk ape is based on a number of anecdotal sightings as well as disputed photographs, audio and video recordings, and footprints. Chuck Coull, the first person to have his encounter with the Mugwump documented and published, claimed the animal looked like a person-sized sturgeon. Jack Dent claimed in 1979 that a descendant of Chief Wabi (aka \"Big Wabi\") had informed him of the creature which lived in the lake. Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources including the cultures of indigenous people across the continent, the European wild man figure, and folk tales among loggers, miners, trappers, and prospectors. Other creatures of relatively similar descriptions are alleged to inhabit various regions throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States; the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia; and the Australian Yowie; all of which, like Bigfoot, are engrained in the cultures of their regions.\n\nQuestion: what do australians call bigfoot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An architect by training, Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler commissioned him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg. One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg. It was used for Nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film Triumph of the Will. Speer modified Werner March's design for the Olympic Stadium being built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the Prachtstrasse, or Street of Magnificence; he also referred to it as the \"North–South Axis\". No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the 4 entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column or Siegessäule, and the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, 46 ft high, was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures proposed as part of Welthauptstadt Germania, Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. During the war, the Speer-designed Reich Chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin. Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge domed assembly hall over 700 ft high, with floor space for 180,000 people.

His renown primarily rests upon his brilliant achievements as a painter, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, being two of the most famous artworks ever created, but also upon his diverse skills as a scientist and inventor.

Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings. Furthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist. By virtue of their scientific significance, artistic excellence, and their portrayal of da Vinci's insatiable curiosity about the natural world, his anatomical drawings continue to inspire and captivate viewers even today.

Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition. Long after the decline of the Roman Empire's sea-borne trade with India, the Portuguese were the next Europeans to sail there for the purpose of trade, first arriving by ship in May 1498. The closing of the traditional trade routes in western Asia by the Ottoman Empire, and rivalry with the Italian states sent Portugal in search of an alternate sea route to India. The first successful voyage to India was by Vasco da Gama in 1498, when after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope he arrived in Calicut, now in Kerala. More than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached Kilwa, the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim.

These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. McCulloch v. Maryland was seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 which prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. of state policy. The constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative and executive powers between the Federation and the States. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government, the absence of dual citizenship, and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency. The Constitution assigns the powers of the federal government to the legislative (Article I), executive (Article II), and judicial (Article III) branches, and the Tenth Amendment provides that those powers not expressly delegated to the federal government are reserved by the States or the people. As a political movement, many constitutionalists have expressed concern over provisions of the 2001 USA Patriot Act, civil asset forfeiture laws, mass surveillance, police checkpoints and militarization of police, while differing over other issues, such as restrictions on firearms,  states' rights to determine drug and restroom laws, and federal management of public lands. From early in the Constitutional Convention, Madison held the position that the national government should be federal because if it were more extensive in relation to the states, that would increase the \"probability of duration, happiness and good order\". It was not initially clear how the new government would interact with the states, and Madison was in favor of a federal form, \"a political system in which at least two territorial levels of government share sovereign constitutional authority over their respective division and joint share of law-making powers; differently put, neither the federal government nor the relevant federative entities may unilaterally alter one another's powers without a process of constitutional amendment in which both levels of government participate.\"\n\nQuestion: what type of government does the us constitution set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There are over 450 balls per year, some featuring as many as nine live orchestras. Balls are held in the many palaces in Vienna, with the principal venue being the Hofburg Palace in Heldenplatz. While the Opera Ball is the best known internationally of all the Austrian balls, other balls such as the Kaffeesiederball (Cafe Owners Ball), the Jägerball (Hunter's Ball) and the Life Ball (AIDS charity event) are almost as well known within Austria and even better appreciated for their cordial atmosphere. Viennese of at least middle class may visit a number of balls in their lifetime. Dancers and opera singers from the Vienna State Opera often perform at the openings of the larger balls. A Vienna ball is an all-night cultural attraction. Major Vienna balls generally begin at 9 pm and last until 5 am, although many guests carry on the celebrations into the next day. Viennese balls are being exported (with support from the City of Vienna) to around 30 cities worldwide such as New York, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Rome, Prague, Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow.

In the ensuing 30+ year period over 3,500 deaths were attributed to these hostilities which came to be known as The Troubles. of Independence (1919–21) and partition of Ireland: most of Ireland became an independent state, while most of Ulster remained within the United Kingdom as the self-governing territory of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's unionist governments were accused of discrimination against Catholics and Irish nationalists. Loyalists opposed the Catholic civil rights movement, accusing it of being a republican front. This unrest led to the Troubles (1969–98). During the conflict, loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) often attacked Catholics in retaliation for republican paramilitary actions. The Unionist governments of Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination against the Irish nationalist and Catholic minority. It was sparked by official permission for an Orange Order march in Portadown, and the RUC's aggressive removal of nationalist protesters who had been blocking the march (the Drumcree conflict). and the vast majority of their victims were random Catholic civilians. During the Troubles there were incidents where some local British soldiers and police colluded with loyalist paramilitaries, such as the attacks by the Glenanne group. Signed in 1973, the Sunningdale Agreement sought to end the conflict by establishing power-sharing government between unionists and Irish nationalists, and ensuring greater co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. In protest, loyalists organized the Ulster Workers' Council strike in May 1974. It was enforced by loyalist paramilitaries and brought large parts of Northern Ireland to a standstill.\n\nQuestion: when did conflict start in ireland?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The eminent Catholic biblical scholar Raymond E. Brown described it as a \"Magna Carta for biblical progress\". Newer Catholic translations of the Bible have been based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages, taking into account as well the ancient translations that sometimes clarify what seem to be transcription errors in those manuscripts. However, the Latin Vulgate remains the official Bible in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. The Council of Trent on April 8, 1546, approved the enforcement of the present Catholic Bible canon including the deuterocanonical books as an article of faith and the decision was confirmed by an anathema by vote (24 yea, 15 nay, 16 abstain).\n\nQuestion: what bible do catholics follow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.

His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. Now 84, Matisse died on 3 November 1954. The day before, when she came to his sickbed, Matisse made a last drawing – it was of her, using a ball-point pen. Hofmann was a young artist working in Paris who painted there before World War I. Hofmann worked in Paris with Robert Delaunay, and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction.

The reproductions include replicas of Tupac's personal notebooks, letters and written plans, along with directions to where Tupac's ashes were said to be spread. \"Pac's Life\" is a single written and performed by American rappers Tupac Shakur and T.I and R&B singer Ashanti, produced by L. T. Hutton for Shakur's posthumously released album of the same name. It is a hip hop and R&B song; the second Tupac verse was recycled from a song titled \"This Life I Lead\". The idea was inspired by Tupac Shakur's poem entitled The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection). The song was written by 2Pac for fellow Death Row rapper M.C. Hammer would later dance and read the lyrics to this song on the first VH1 Hip Hop Honors in 2004.

Hammer wrote this about the song: \"This song was given to me as a gift from the late Tupac Shakur. Thank you Tupac for this beautiful, spiritual song.\" Hammer would later go on to mention his friendship with Tupac and the gift of this song to him in a TBN interview. The Rose That Grew from Concrete is a posthumous album based on the poetry/writings of Tupac Shakur, released on November 21, 2000.

However, because the graphemes in Chinese's logographic writing system are not directly linked to pronunciation (though there are quasi-phonetic hints), Cantonese speakers who do not speak Mandarin will read aloud the characters in Cantonese pronunciation only. Here is an example:  In the above example, note the switching of the direct and indirect objects and the use of different vocabulary for certain words in the standard Chinese and colloquial Cantonese renditions. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and one of the official languages of Singapore. Standard Mandarin Chinese now dominates public life in mainland China, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese. Before the modern adoption of written vernacular Chinese, the diglossic situation also applied to Mandarin speakers when Classical Chinese was the standard written language. Note: Mandarin romanized using Hanyu Pinyin. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China. For instance in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the primary language of spoken communication, although all formal written communication is done in standard written Chinese. Unique among the other Chinese language varieties, Cantonese has its own written form, but it is largely used in informal contexts, such as \n\n For over two thousand years, the Chinese used Classical Chinese (Literary Chinese) as a formal standard written language. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication.\n\nQuestion: what language do chinese people write in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Patterns such as fleur-de-lys returned to \n\n It was Richard Wagner's music that inspired Dallapiccola to start composing in earnest, and Claude Debussy's that caused him to stop: hearing Der fliegende Holländer while exiled to Austria convinced the young man that composition was his calling, but after first hearing Debussy in 1921, at age 17, he stopped composing for three years in order to give this important influence time to sink in. The neoclassical works of Ferruccio Busoni would figure prominently in his later work, but his biggest influence would be the ideas of the Second Viennese School, which he encountered in the 1930s, particularly Alban Berg \n\n Debussy is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. Not only Debussy's use of whole-tone scales, but also his style of word-setting in Pelléas et Mélisande, were the subject of study by Leoš Janáček while he was writing his 1921 opera Káťa Kabanová. ; Claude Debussy (1862–1918). Like Beethoven, Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of Maeterlinck's Symbolist play Pelléas et Mélisande is a key work in 20th century music drama. In many ways an \"anti-opera\", Pelléas contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the première had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream-like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate (or repel) listeners today.\n\nQuestion: what type of music did claude debussy play?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Paraguay is a landlocked country in South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. The vast majority of its population identifies as Roman Catholic, and religion in Paraguay plays a very important role. Paraguay is a socially conservative society; and has been slow to change traditional views on family: divorce was legalized only in 1991. Paraguayan Guarani, is, alongside Spanish, one of the official languages of Paraguay. Paraguay's constitution is bilingual, and its state-produced textbooks are typically half in Spanish and half in Guarani. A variety of Guarani known as Chiripá is also spoken in Paraguay. It is closely related to Paraguayan Guarani, a language which speakers are increasingly switching to. There are 7,000 speakers of Chiripá in Paraguay.

He was fascinated by the Code of Hammurabi and pursued the subject avidly, even after leaving Iraq. Between 1952 and 1955, he wrote a series of six detailed articles in Urdu on Hammurabi, his laws, Babylonian civilisation, traditions, customs and language. The six articles were subsequently revised, expanded and published as a book and in 2000, a new edition was published in Lahore entitled \"Hammurabi aur Babli Tahzib va Tamaddum\". Malik Ram maintained that Hammurabi is one of the all-time great figures in world history, who should be given more attention, time and space in the modern world, in educational institutions and by the media. The Code of Hammurabi, promulgated about 1772 BC by the Babylonian king Hammurabi specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man. Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of Elam made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates. Other parts of the Code of Hammurabi show both debt and slavery as being part of the criminal justice system of the time, such as, \"If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and does not so keep it; if then the dam break \n\n The following is the 7th section of the Hammurabi law code, written in the mid-18th century BC:\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi, a set of laws dating back to ancient Mesopotamia, is often regarded as one of the earliest recorded codes of ethics in human history.

Its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), originally known as Byzantium. In 324, the ancient city of Byzantium was renamed “New Rome” and declared the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was renamed, and dedicated on 11 May 330. New Rome (Greek: Νέα Ῥώμη, Nea Romē; ; Latin: Nova Roma; ) was the original name given by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great in 330 CE to his new imperial capital, which was built as an expansion of the city of Byzantium on the European coast of the Bosporus strait. The city was founded as Byzantion by Megarian colonists in 657 BCE. It was renamed by Constantine the Great first as \"New Rome\" (Nova Roma) during the official dedication of the city as the new Roman capital in 330 CE, which he soon afterwards changed to Constantinople (Constantinopolis).

During the 1999 Ozzfest tour, Jordison met Tripp Eisen and asked him if he was interested in a project he had in mind; the reforming of the Rejects with Draztik. Donnie Steele began his career as a member of Des Moines, Iowa-based death metal band Body Pit, in which fellow future Slipknot members Anders Colsefni (vocals), Mick Thomson (guitar) and Paul Gray (bass) had all performed. He later co-founded Slipknot in September 1995, alongside Colsefni, Gray, second guitarist Josh \"Gnar\" Brainard, drummer Joey Jordison and percussionist Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan. Joey Jordison has said that he considers Women and Children Last as really the first true Murderdolls album. The band was expected to embark on a tour of North America, but the idea was scrapped after Jordison began touring with Rob Zombie on the Hellbilly Deluxe 2 World Tour and after the untimely death of his Slipknot bandmate Paul Gray.

In 1995, Crahan formed a metal band known as the Pale Ones with fellow musician Paul Gray, which featured himself as the band's drummer. Wanting to expand the band's percussion section, Crahan brought in Joey Jordison to fill in as drummer while Crahan's efforts were focused on percussion.

Some ordinary people had to hire special \"request-writers\" (arzuhâlcis) to be able to communicate with the government.

The Turkification of Anatolia began under the rule of the Seljuk Empire in the late 11th century and it continued under the rule of the Ottoman Empire between the late 13th and the early 20th century and it has continued under the rule of today's Republic of Turkey. However, various non-Turkic languages continue to be spoken by minorities in Anatolia today, including Kurdish, Neo-Aramaic, Armenian, Arabic, Laz, Georgian and Greek.

At first, suffrage was treated as a lower priority. The French Revolution accelerated this, with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the 1789 march on Versailles. In 1793, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women was founded, and originally included suffrage on its agenda before it was suppressed at the end of the year. There was little sign of change in the political or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women's movement. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views. In Scotland, Reid published her influential A Plea for Woman in 1843, which proposed a transatlantic Western agenda for women's rights, including voting rights for women. Caroline Norton advocated for changes in British law. The publicity generated from her appeal to Queen Victoria and related activism helped change English laws to recognize and accommodate married women and child custody issues. is said to be the woman in the famous picture which was on the front page of the Daily Mirror on 19 November and became an iconic image of the suffrage movement, the reporter said she had been at seven demonstrations and 'never known the police so violent\" and had 'pushed [her] as roughly as he would have done any man' but saying he wouldn't 'give [her] the satisfaction of arresting [her].'\n\nQuestion: what did queen victoria say about the suffragettes?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

St Antony is considered the patron saint of those with items lost or misplaced. The prolific Neopolitan painter Giordano \n\n Nicholas was canonized by Pope Eugene IV (also an Augustinian) on the 5th of June in 1446. He was the first Augustinian to be canonized. At his canonization, Nicholas was credited with three hundred miracles, including three resurrections. He is particularly invoked as an advocate for the souls in Purgatory, especially during Lent and the month of November. In many Augustinian churches, there are weekly devotions to St Nicholas on behalf of the suffering souls. According to Loyola Press, she was a saint because of her charitable works, not her trances, demonstrated by her forgiveness towards a group of people who abused her during a trance, despite the excruciating pain they caused her. She ministered to the sick and the poor, moving into the hospital in Siena towards the end of her life, \"subjecting herself to great mortifications\". Her feast day is April 26. Jerome's version of the Life of St Anthony the Great, written by Athanasius of Alexandria about the hermit monk of Egypt, was widely disseminated in the Middle Ages; it relates Anthony's encounter with a centaur who challenged the saint, but was forced to admit that the old gods had been overthrown. The episode was often depicted in The Meeting of St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit by the painter Stefano di Giovanni, who was known as \"Sassetta\". Of the two episodic depictions of the hermit Anthony's travel to greet the hermit Paul, one is his encounter with the demonic figure of a centaur along the pathway in a wood.\n\nQuestion: what is st anthony patron saint of?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the Song Dynasty (960-1276), there was a booming business in the Sichan region that led to a shortage of copper money. It is also used as a synonym of that currency, especially in international contexts – the ISO 4217 standard code for renminbi is CNY, an abbreviation of \"Chinese yuan\". When used in English in the context of the modern foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan (CNY) refers to the renminbi (RMB), which is the official currency used in mainland China. However, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China has been concerned that the Chinese financial system would not be able to handle the potential rapid cross-border movements of hot money, and as a result, as of 2012, the currency trades within a narrow band specified by the Chinese central government. Following the internationalization of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF voted to designate the renminbi as one of several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special drawing rights. The RMB became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's SDR basket on 1 October 2016. The other main world currencies are the United States dollar, euro, British pound, and Japanese yen. The renminbi (abbreviation: RMB; ; symbol: 元/¥; code: CNY) is the official currency of the People's Republic of China and one of the world's reserve currencies, ranking as the eighth most traded currency in the world as of April 2019. The yuan is the basic unit of the renminbi, but the word is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts.

The French influence over the area lead to legislation that preserved a portion of the region as the Périgord-Limousin Regional Nature Park in 1998. The Périgord region's different terrains and areas were labeled the Périgord Vert, Blanc, Pourpre, and Noir (green, white, purple, and black).\n\nQuestion: where is perpignan located?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bosnia faced many challenges during the war, including bombings throughout the country that ruined much of the infrastructure. Parallel regimes took over Bosnia and flipped the country upside down with land mines, bullets, and bombings. The war in Bosnia also consisted of an ethnic \"cleanse\" of Bosnian Muslims initiated by Bosnian Serbs, which included containment of Bosniaks in concentration camps. By November 1992 Serbs had conquered 70% of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and held Sarajevo in limbo by terrorizing its population by shelling and constant sniper fire. Political disputes and minor incidents in central and northern Bosnia and in northern and central Herzegovina led to Croat-Bosniak War in November 1992. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered a large area which was under control of HVO; almost the whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and the wider areas around those towns \n\n The siege of Mostar was fought during the Bosnian War first in 1992 and then again later in 1993 to 1994. Initially lasting between April 1992 and June 1992, it involved the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) fighting against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. That phase ended in June 1992 after the success of Operation Jackal, launched by the Croatian Army (HV) and HVO. As the wider conflict matured and the political landscape changed, the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks began to fight against each other, culminating in the Croat–Bosniak War. Between June 1993 and April 1994 the HVO besieged Bosniak-concentrated East Mostar, resulting in the deaths of numerous civilians, a cut off of humanitarian aid, damage or destruction of ten mosques, and the blowing up of the historic Stari Most bridge.\n\nQuestion: what happened in bosnia in the 90s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These theologians anchored Ubuntu in the Christian ideals of forgiveness and reconciliation as gifts from God critical for peaceful communal co-existence. Tutu, as chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa between 1996 and 1998, and operating from the premise of faith, theologizes the Ubuntu concept by anchoring it beyond community into God through the biblical category of the imago Dei. Tutu sees all realms of life in relation to God and all humanity as created in the image of God.

Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States. English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century. The primary, although not official, language of the United States is English. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others which were imported by immigrants.\n\nQuestion: where english is spoken?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence; this is despite being the oldest wonder by about 2,000 years. It is located on the south side of the Menkaure pyramid in the Giza Necropolis. Located at the Pyramids of Gizeh, the necropolis included the Valley Temple of Khafre, a mortuary temple, the Great Sphinx, and a causeway leading to the pyramid of Khafre. The Great Pyramids of Gizeh (Pyramids of Giza), located on the outskirts of present-day Cairo, are three enormous pyramids for three Egyptian pharaohs with multiple smaller ones, housing the mummies of the royal family and nobles. From largest to smallest, the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure are the most famous and dedicated to each \n\n  The Giza Plateau is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the \"Great Pyramid\" and the \"Pyramid of Cheops\"), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren), the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as \"Queen's pyramids\", and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Of the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex.

The oldest of them all, Progress Energy Park, home of Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, was retired on March 28 with the Tampa Bay Rays losing to the Cincinnati Reds 6–3. The Rays, unlike the other teams to close stadiums before them, are staying in Florida; they are relocating their spring training home to the Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, where they spent $20 million to rebuild its main stadium. The site of Progress Energy Park was connected to plans to build a new retractable roof stadium for the Rays to replace the fixed-dome Tropicana Field, but was eventually withdrawn from consideration by team ownership in favor of a more thorough study. In the final spring training game at Municipal Stadium, held on March 26, 1997, the Expos defeated the Braves 2-0.

Tributaries of the river here go by different names, including the Linyanti and the Chobe. The province's far east is where the Kwando meets the Zambezi. The Zambezi Region (German and Afrikaans: Sambesi), until 2013 known as the Caprivi Region, is one of the 14 regions of Namibia, located in the extreme north-east of the country. It is largely concurrent with the Caprivi Strip and takes its name from the Zambezi River that runs along its border. The self-governed village Bukalo belongs to this region. The Zambezi Region had a population of 90,596 in 2011. The Zambezian flooded grasslands can be found on seasonally- or permanently-flooded lowlands in the basin of the Zambezi and neighboring river basins.

His music has been featured in various television shows and movies, such as MTV's The Real World and the movies Palo Alto and True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet. After his activist outings during 2010-2011, Mraz felt inspired to write an album and told that it was based around the theme of love. Waiting for My Rocket to Come is the debut studio album by the American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz, released on October 15, 2002, by Elektra Records. By December 2003, the album had sold 500,000 copies, prompting Entertainment Weekly to dub Mraz \"The winner of 2003’s sensitive singer-songwriter sweepstakes\". Mraz said the title was an optimistic title, reflecting the process of playing music while simultaneously preparing for success while waiting for success to arrive.\n\nQuestion: where is jason mraz from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The capital and largest city is Bratislava. Slovakia is a high-income advanced economy with a very high Human Development Index, a very high standard of living and performs favourably in measurements of civil liberties, press freedom, internet freedom, democratic governance and peacefulness. Slovakia is also a member of the Schengen Area, NATO, the United Nations, the OECD, the WTO, CERN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Visegrád Group. The Slovak Republic (Slovenská republika, SR) was from 1990 to 1992 a republic within the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, that is now the independent Slovakia. the Slovak Socialist Republic was renamed Slovak Republic (still part of Czechoslovakia, since April 1990 of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic). As of 1 January 1993, the Slovak Republic became an independent state and officially took the name Slovakia as a short form – see dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Conventional wisdom suggested that the country would resume the name used from 1919 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1960, Czechoslovak Republic (Československá republika).

A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. ; Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), Danish physicist \n\n Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, about 14 years after Mozart (born Salzburg, 1756). In 1781, during Beethoven's childhood, Mozart had moved from Salzburg to Vienna, the Austrian imperial capital, to pursue his career. During his youth and musical training in Bonn, Beethoven had extensive, intimate exposure to Mozart's music. Indeed, Lewis Lockwood writes, \"Just as Mozart had once told his father that he was 'soaked in music', so Beethoven was soaked in Mozart.\" In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. On the Prague phase of his journey, Beethoven composed an extended concert aria for the noted soprano Josepha Duschek, as Mozart had done on his visit in 1789. The compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven consist of 722 works written over forty-five years, from his earliest work in 1782 (variations for piano on a march by Ernst Christoph Dressler) when he was only eleven years old and still in Bonn, until his last work just before his death in Vienna in 1827. Beethoven composed works in all the main genres of classical music, including symphonies, concertos, string quartets, piano sonatas and the opera.

It was here, on her farm, that she wrote the Little House books. Pepin, Wisconsin, is the birthplace of author Laura Ingalls Wilder. Nellie Oleson appeared in three of the Little House novels Ingalls Wilder: On the Banks of Plum Creek (1937), Little Town on the Prairie (1939), and These Happy Golden Years (1943) — the fourth, seventh, and eighth in the series.

Italy is a parliamentary republic: the President of the Republic is elected for a seven-year term by the two houses of Parliament in joint session, together with special electors appointed by the Regional Councils. During its history, Italy has had many political parties, both national and regional, with different party systems. The most recent Italian general election was held on 4 March 2018.

In his second novel, Iweala explores the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, nationality and the diaspora through the story of Niru, a Nigerian-American high-school senior living in a middle-class suburb of Washington, D.C., who comes out as gay to his white straight friend Meredith. The first two thirds of the book are narrated by Niru while the last third is narrated by Meredith. Niru is forced to confront the many ways in which he is privileged, as well as disenfranchised. Iweala also interweaves themes of religion, cultural dislocation, mental health, police brutality, and more, all of which further add to and further complicate Niru's life and identities. The exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" contributes to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, including their guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. The poem portrays the interactions and tensions between Christabel and Geraldine on a visceral and psychological level, rather than simply attributing their actions to supernatural or demonic influences. By examining the implications of a lesbian act in the world of \"Christabel,\" we can gain insight into the complexities of the characters. One aspect that stands out is the reversal of gender expectations in the sexual relationship between Christabel and Geraldine. Furthermore, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in the poem can also shed light on the characters' feelings of guilt and pleasure. Christabel, on the other hand, experiences pleasure in her interactions with Geraldine, suggesting a sense of liberation and self-discovery. The manipulation of gender roles and the depiction of lesbian sexuality also provide a contrast to the homosocial bond between Sir Leoline and Sir Roland in Part II of the poem. Overall, the exploration of lesbian sexuality in \"Christabel\" adds depth to the understanding of the characters' dynamics, guilt, pleasure, and manipulation of gender roles. It challenges societal expectations, highlights power dynamics, and delves into the complexities of human relationships and sexual identity. Equality 7-2521, a 21-year-old man writing by candlelight in a tunnel under the earth, tells the story of his life up to that point. He was raised like all children in his society, away from his parents in collective homes: the Home of Infants from birth until five years old, then the Home of Students from five to fifteen. He believes he has a \"curse\" that makes him learn quickly and ask many questions. I wrote about the lessons I learned from this journey in a manuscript called “Original Parts: Aging and Reckoning with Cystic Fibrosis Related Kidney Disease”. It’s a good example of how “writing where it hurts” can enrich academic literature as surely as it can expand general knowledge about improving care for people with health challenges. If you’d like to read the manuscript, it’s available here free of charge. As usual, let us know if you have any problems accessing the text—we will happily send you a PDF copy instead. The author of this post is a transgender person conducting research on higher education in the United States. Here, in Part Three, they share the rest of their informal interviews with these scholars picking up at question 3. How do you hold yourself accountable for gender-expansive praxis? Scholar #1: I try to be honest with myself about … if I’m really asking those questions and pushing on those assumptions consistently. I step back when I think I might be going down a scholarly road that isn’t my place. Scholar #2: I think that holding myself accountable starts with my inner work. I’m the first to acknowledge that I’m a work in progress and don’t always get it right. Yet, I also want them to know that they’ll get things wrong too and that it’s important for us to learn together in community and work to get it right. These are all important practice that come to mind around holding myself accountable. Scholar #1: In my life, I’ve come to understand a few things about social change work. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, I really believe this. But I also think it’s imperative for each of us to figure out how we can get outside of only our own oppression and work actively to end another’s, lest we become a bit too myopic and self-serving in how we do the work. I can’t only, always, ever think about cis women’s oppression, though it is real and ending it is important to me. That can’t be the whole focus of my work, because then, I am only advancing myself and others like me. I think we can all do more to end oppression for groups we don’t belong to, and I think we must, lest we become so deeply invested in our own identities and their shifting power terms that we lose sight of everything else. Much of this is due to white supremacy and genderism. The intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and other identities becomes a moral imperative that should move humanity to take action. I think that’s a problem. Yet, I am aware that often they do. Gender-expansive praxis has the ability to correct that though, and that’s the work that I am committed to doing. Scholar #1: The simple answer is because it’s the right thing to do. That’s my cause, and as long as I have breath, I’m sticking to it! Scholar #2: Because it’s the right thing to do. Gender-expansive work says that we don’t have to be restricted by boxes and labels unnecessarily if we don’t want. It opens up new possibilities, and what’s wrong with that? And there are choices to be made with that privilege. In his novel \"Midnight's Children,\" Salman Rushdie uses alcohol and alcoholism to delve into the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Rushdie employs alcohol and inebriation as lenses through which he explores various aspects of colonial life and the impact of British rule. One of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. Alcohol becomes a symbol through which the characters in the novel negotiate their identities and navigate the changing social and political landscapes. By using alcohol as a tool, Rushdie explores the conflicts and tensions that emerge as India transitions from a colonized nation to an independent one. Another way Rushdie uses alcohol is to satirize and undermine the supposed benefits that Empire presented to India and its people. By depicting characters struggling with alcoholism, he challenges the notion that colonial rule brought progress and advancement to the country. Through the lens of alcohol, Rushdie critiques the exploitative nature of Empire and exposes the contradictions inherent in its claims of superiority. Furthermore, Rushdie's exploration of alcohol and alcoholism allows him to delve into the medical legacy of Empire. He highlights the negative health consequences associated with excessive drinking and the toll it takes on individuals and society. By incorporating medical sources related to alcohol and inebriation, Rushdie sheds light on the detrimental effects of both personal and societal reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism or means of escape. Overall, Salman Rushdie's use of alcohol and alcoholism in \"Midnight's Children\" offers a multi-dimensional perspective on the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Through this literary device, Rushdie explores the complexities of identity, satirizes the claims of Empire, and exposes the health consequences associated with excessive drinking.\n\nQuestion: what did john irving wrote?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Her character often vexed the captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard, who spurned her amorous advances. Portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg, Guinan is a bartender in the Ten-Forward lounge aboard the starship USS Enterprise-D. She was also played as a child by Isis Carmen Jones in the episode \"Rascals\". The character is an alien who is several hundred years old and is noted for her warmth and folk wisdom, which she often uses to defuse difficult situations or comfort other characters aboard the ship as they struggle with something. In this episode, Worf, his son Alexander Rozhenko, and Deanna Troi are trapped in the holodeck where the characters resemble Data and have his superior abilities.

A study published in 2005 by the World Health Organization estimates that there may eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Industry, UN and DOE agencies claim low \n\n in cleaning Chernobyl and 10,800 square miles were contaminated. Social scientist and energy policy expert, Benjamin K. Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants from 1952 to 2009 (defined as incidents that either resulted in the loss of human life or more than US$50,000 of property damage, the amount the US federal government uses to define major energy accidents that must be reported), totaling US$20.5 billion in property damages. The  was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines. , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima. Summary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Radiation release\nExperts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. WHO Report \nIn 2013, two years after the incident, the World Health Organization indicated that the residents of the area who were evacuated were exposed to so little radiation that radiation induced health impacts are likely to be below detectable levels. The health risks in the WHO assessment attributable to the Fukushima radioactivity release were calculated by largely applying the conservative Linear no-threshold model of radiation exposure, a model that assumes even the smallest amount of radiation exposure will cause a negative health effect. The estimated risk of cancer to people who were children and adults during the Fukushima accident, in the most affected area, was determined to be lower again when compared to the most at risk group – infants. No increase in these effects are therefore expected in or around the Fukushima power plants. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks.\" A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. On 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radioactivity release is high. Potential exposure could exceed 20 mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. , six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. According to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as \"disaster-related\" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Z. Jacobson, based on linear no-threshold (LNT) model, the radioactivity released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimator being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. The radioactivity released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radioactivity release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life. There is no known mechanism for this, and \"the cities under study with the lowest radiation fallout have the highest increases of death rates in the 14 weeks following Fukushima, while the Californian cities that would have received larger doses saw a decrease in death rate growth\" and concluded that \"innumerable factors other than radiation\" were likely responsible for the major part of the variation in US mortality around the time of the nuclear disaster. The author of the initial paper which attempts to draw a link between infant mortality in the US and the Fukushima accident, Joseph Mangano and his colleague Ernest J. Sternglass, both of the Radiation and Public Health Project, were also active publishing work attempting to draw a causality between infant death rates in Pennsylvania due to the Three Mile Island accident(TMI-2) in 1979, but likewise, these earlier papers conclusions have failed to be corroborated by any other peer reviewed paper or follow up epidemiology study, with Sternglass's paper being widely critiqued. These results are consistent with findings in\nEurope after Chernobyl. There were slight increases in areas with moderate levels of contamination and no increases in the rest of Japan. by Kenichi Ohmae, Team H2O Project. 28 October 2011\n\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster\n\nThe  was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines. , the Fukushima prefecture government counted 2,129 \"disaster-related deaths\" in the prefecture. This value exceeds the number that have died in Fukushima prefecture directly from the earthquake and tsunami. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”. According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the government awarded workers’ compensation to a man who developed leukemia while working on the Fukushima cleanup in 2015 and has acknowledged that three other Fukushima workers developed leukemia and thyroid cancer after working on the plant cleanup. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). In 2018 one worker died from lung cancer as a result from radiation exposure. The Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people from effects unrelated to destruction of the reactors at Fukushima. Summary of events\n\nThe plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several strongly damaging hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts.

Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. Average annual exposure in the region from naturally occurring sources is about 2.1 mSv, and average lifetime exposure is 170 mSv (Chapter II A(2) paragraph 29).

Consultation takes place under the leadership of the CCP, with mass organizations, the United Front parties, and \"representatives from all walks of life\". This process is institutionalized in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Since 2018, the main body of the Chinese constitution declares that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\" The 2018 amendments constitutionalized the de facto one-party state status of China, wherein the CCP General Secretary (party leader) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the informal Paramount leader.

Cuba is attempting to gradually phase out the Cuban convertible peso, unifying the two in the Cuban peso. Panama uses the United States dollar informally, but additionally uses the Panamanian balboa as legal tender. Túmin is an alternative currency used in the municipality of Espinal, Veracruz, Mexico. Used as a complementary currency, the Tumin was first put in circulation in 2010 as a student project at the Intercultural University of Veracruz, where students were trying to find ways of strengthening the local economy.

The Cuanza is the only river wholly within Angola that is navigable—for nearly 200 kilometers from its mouth—by boats of commercially or militarily significant size. The \n\n The Zambezi Region is situated is a tropical area, with high temperatures and much rainfall during the December-to-March rainy season, making it the wettest region of Namibia. In addition to the Zambezi River, the strip also holds the Kwando River, which marks the border with Botswana. Tributaries of the river here go by different names, including the Linyanti and the Chobe. The province's far east is where the Kwando meets the Zambezi. Its water is used for irrigation and for hydroelectric powe r. It is the largest tributary of the Zambezi, and of Zambia's principal rivers, it is the most central and the most urban. The river discharges 10 km³ per year into the Zambezi River. A Zambezi shark (Carcharhinus leucas) was caught at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950.

Pakistan joined the United Nations on 30 September 1947, despite opposition from Afghanistan because of the Durand Line issue. The Pakistan Armed Forces are the third largest contributor of troops towards UN peacekeeping efforts, behind India and Ethiopia. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. All operations must include the resolution of conflicts through the use of force to be considered valid under the charter of the United Nations. The United Nations oversees 14 peacekeeping operations around the world. UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO's mandate seeks and includes: working worldwide to promote health, keeping the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, and collects data on global health issues. The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. Among the largest contributors were Germany (which contributed 12.18% of the budget), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (11.65%), and the United States (7.85%). The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Seven of these international conferences, spanning 41 years, were convened before any resulted in a multi-state international agreement. The seventh conference, in Venice in 1892, finally resulted in a convention. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. While Denmark, Sweden-Norway, and the USA did not sign this convention, it was unanimously agreed that the work of the prior conferences should be codified for implementation. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau (1902), and the  (1907) were soon founded. When the League of Nations was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. The ICCDE recommends to WHO which countries fulfill requirements for certification. 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis, and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The WHO works to improve nutrition, food safety and food security and to ensure this has a positive effect on public health and sustainable development. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. Reform efforts following the Ebola outbreak\nFollowing the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. However, Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, canceled the planned withdrawal and announced in January 2021 that the U.S. would resume funding the organization. Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981), Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003) the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010) as well as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and its pediatric counterpart. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. It also contains important international documents and information. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". The World Health Assembly is attended by delegations from all member states, and determines the policies of the organization. In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly, they are seated alongside the other NGOs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. It appoints the director-general every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. Director-General\n\nThe head of the organization is the director-general, elected by the World Health Assembly. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003. On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Country and liaison offices\nThe World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. Financing and partnerships\n\nPresent \nThe WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2020, the biggest contributor is the United States, which gives over $400 million annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. , the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million). According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through. The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty \n\nThe United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and advocating for global health initiatives. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN. One of the ways the UN promotes social justice is through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. The UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. Through partnerships with various charitable and governmental organizations, the UN supports initiatives such as training local surgical teams and establishing specialty surgical hospitals. In summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all.\n\nQuestion: what countries do the united nations help?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The match took place on the 18 August 2002 at the Estádio do Bonfim in Setúbal, and was contested between 2001–02 Primeira Liga and 2001–02 Taça de Portugal winners Sporting CP, and cup runners-up Leixões. This competition is notable as this would be the only silverware Cristiano Ronaldo won with Sporting before his transfer to Manchester United less than a year later. Played in front of a crowd of 6,000, the Leões defeated the Heróis do Mar 5–1. Goals in either half from attacking midfielder Ricardo Fernandes, strikes from Sporting strikers Marius Niculae and Vitali Kutuzov, and an 87th-minute goal from Carlos Martins saw Sporting CP defeat the opposition comfortably and raise the club's tally to five trophies in this competition.

Banks would accept the exchange of legacy currencies, begin to dispense euros from ATMs, and only euros would be available as withdrawals were made, beginning on 1 January. In Germany, the Deutsche Mark would no longer be a legal tender on 1 January, but would have to be exchanged at the banks. Despite the massive amounts of euros available, chaos was feared.

On 1 January 2002 the euro notes and coins were officially introduced into circulation in many European countries, including Germany, where the Deutsche Mark used to be an official currency. Thus the Deutsche Mark ceased to be legal tender immediately upon the adoption of the euro. The main motives were the same as before – to ensure monetary stability and to continue to avoid the high/hyper inflation seen in preceding decades. In Germany, Deutsche Telekom modified 50,000 pay phones to take Deutsche Mark coins in 2005, at least on a temporary basis. Callers were allowed to use DM coins, at least initially, with the Deutsche Mark pegged to equal one euro, almost twice the usual rate.

The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles: Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon \n\n that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. After his death in 1937, he was buried in Westminster Abbey near Sir Isaac Newton. By analogy with the division of biological cells, he named the process \"fission\". The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and\n\nQuestion: what did james chadwick invent?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The war ended in 1783 and was followed by a period of prosperity. However, the national government had no money either to pay the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even the repetition of internal revolts such as the Shays' Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts. They \n\n The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution that occurred in British America between 1765 and 1791. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. The United States has the world's oldest written constitution, and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the US Constitution, often word-for-word in places. It inspired the French, Haitian, Latin American Revolutions, and others into the modern era. Although the Revolution eliminated many forms of inequality, it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war.

According to Lomas (2004), the crucial factor in Latinising these remaining groups that resisted full integration was granting them Roman citizenship (most notably by the Lex Iulia de Civitate Latinis et Sociis Danda in 90 BCE), thereby leading them to participate in Roman–Latin society and gradually abandon their Italic, Etruscan, Celtic etc. be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.

Starr's fellow ex-Beatle George Harrison wrote the song along with Mal Evans, the Beatles' longtime aide and a personal assistant to Starr during the making of Ringo. The track serves as a farewell from Starr to his audience in the manner of a show-closing finale, by lyrically referring to the completion of the album. During the extended fadeout, Starr delivers a spoken message in which he thanks the musicians and studio personnel who helped with the recording of Ringo – among them, Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and his producer, Richard Perry. In March 1973, following the completion of his album Living in the Material World, Harrison offered \"Sunshine Life for Me\" to Starr for inclusion on the latter's first rock solo album, Ringo.

Her mother, Viola, died when she was two years old, and thereafter, she was raised by her father, Rev. James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. To distinguish her from her grandmother, she was called \"Little Lucy Smith\" as a child, a nickname that she would continue to use during her gospel career. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer.

That's just what kind of baby Lucy was. But when Cynthia noticed at 3 months what looked like a hernia around Lucy's groin, she decided to take her to the pediatrician near their home in Winter Park, Colorado, nestled into the mountains west of Denver at about 9,500 feet. An hour later, Lucy was in a helicopter rushing to Children's Hospital Colorado while her parents drove down behind. It was a frightening ordeal, particularly for Cynthia, who, as a teen, had suffered a meningococcal infection that came on suddenly, shut down her major organs and put her in a coma that lasted weeks. It left her with skin grafts all over her body. Doctors were forced to amputate her legs. \"My mom flew out from Australia when Lucy was in the hospital,\" Cynthia recalls. Lucy's condition stayed distressingly touch-and-go for three months. But once she was stable, they sent her home. Then, in April of last year, a routine blood test showed Lucy’s platelet count rapidly dropping. \"It's like a Ferrari someone cut the brakes on. Drs. Hence the anemia. Hence the low platelet count. In Lucy's case, Drs. Dixon and Goebel suspected it was atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS, the result of a genetic defect in a component of the immune system known as complement. Its power is immediate and immense. That's what was happening to Lucy, and the complement system's sudden spiral led to another 7 weeks in the hospital. That would save her life, but it would also leave her complement system powerless against meningococcal disease — the same infection that had taken Cynthia's legs. \"That was a difficult conversation to have,\" says Dr. Dixon. He speculated it was possible that the same underlying defect had caused Cynthia's infection. Drs. Her condition was so rare that, once she entered the trial, Children's Colorado became one of just two sites in the world with more than one patient enrolled. Lucy's platelet count went up and her blood pressure stabilized. Drs. One of them belongs to Dr. Frazer-Abel: Exsera BioLabs, just across the street from Children's Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus. \"It's also more realistic, because our bodies are made of cells. You have to be able to control for that. \"We're friends with Exsera,\" says Dr. Goebel. The result proved what Drs. A genetic test eventually confirmed the diagnosis. With vaccinations against meningococcus and prophylactic antibiotics, along with several blood pressure medications, Lucy lives the life of a relatively normal 2-year-old. Kids went through fruitless kidney transplants, sometimes several, to no avail. For now, Lucy's team is working with a health center near Winter Park to try to move Lucy's bi-weekly infusions closer to home. As it stands, that's the best and only option, perhaps for the rest of Lucy's life. The current record, completed at The Institute for Genomic Medicine in San Diego, is 19 hours. \"She's doing great. She really is,\" says Cynthia. But right now one day a week is as much as I can put up with.\" \"We're stronger just knowing there's a treatment,\" says Cynthia. \"Lucy's team is amazing. We trust them with her life completely.\" According to the legend, Lucy was a 75-year-old widow and Geminian a young catechist. Lucy was accused by her son, Eutropius (or Euprepius), of being a Christian. She was brought before Diocletian, who at first attempted to dissuade her and then placed her in a cauldron of burning pitch; Lucy lived for three days in the cauldron. When Diocletian heard that she was still alive, he ordered her to be carried around the city, with weights loaded on her body. When Lucy was paraded by Geminian's house, the statues of Roman gods in his home shattered miraculously and a dove made the sign of the cross over Geminian's head. He followed Lucy, asking for instruction in the Christian religion as well as baptism. A priest named Protasius helped him with his request. 75 people were converted to Christianity by the example of Geminian. The judge presiding at their trial was thrown from his horse on a stone bridge; his body was never found. Lucy and Geminian were ultimately beheaded. They were buried by a woman named Maxima. Lucy was a perfectly healthy infant until the fall of 2011, when her parents noticed that the shape of her head was changing - a bump, a protrusion was forming in the back of her skull and her forehead was becoming more prominent. After extensive online research, Lucy's mom, Katie, came across a condition that fit Lucy's symptoms: craniosynostosis, a premature fusion of the cranial sutures between the bones of a baby's skull. Babies are born with incompletely fused skull bones to accommodate brain growth during infancy. In the spring of 2012, the Jenkins family came to Johns Hopkins Children's Center where they met pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. George Jallo and plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Amir Dorafshar. Even though craniosynostosis repairs have been done for many years, the Hopkins surgeons used a novel approach that ensured greater accuracy and precision. Before the surgery, Lucy underwent a 3-D head CT scan, which allowed the surgeons to meticulously plan every cut before they even made the first incision. \"When Dr. Dorafshar talked to us about it, I immediately felt that it was in Lucy's best interest to have it done. Lucy's parents even saw the computer models of Lucy's head along with the planned cuts and reconstruction. On Aug. 8, 2012 Lucy underwent a five-and-a-half-hour surgery. Thankfully, the rest of the procedure was uneventful, and Lucy went to the pediatric intensive care unit that day. However, when Dr. Dorafshar stopped by the PICU that day to check on her, he saw an alarming sign - Lucy's abdomen was so swollen that it was pushing on her lungs causing her to have difficulty breathing. Lucy had developed abdominal compartment syndrome as a result of the fast infusion of blood during the surgery. To release the penned up fluid from her abdomen, Lucy had to have a minor procedure, which relieved pressure and restored normal breathing. The only thing I remember about that time was hearing Dr. Dorafshar's voice, and that was all I could focus on. He was so calm and reassuring, and that was exactly what I needed to stay composed and to begin to focus on helping Lucy to recover.\" By the time, she left the hospital, Lucy was sitting up on her own, crawling around her crib, playing, laughing and talking. Today, Lucy is perfectly healthy, much to the delight of her parents and surgeons. Lucy loves to visit Hopkins and knows the doctors and staff took excellent care of her; when asked about her doctors, she fondly says \"they fixed my head!\" \"I can't say enough about the care Lucy received while she was in the hospital,\" Katie says. \"Lucy's surgery changed my life, and I will always be so thankful for the care Lucy received, in particular from Dr. Dorafshar, Dr. Jallo, Dr. Carson, Dr. Whitaker, Dr. Greenberg, Dr. Abdullah, and all of the attending physicians, PICU nurses and staff. We feel very fortunate that we live so close to Johns Hopkins Children's Center.\" Saints Lucy and Geminian were venerated on 16 September as saints who died as martyrs in Rome during the persecution of Diocletian in about 290 or 300 or, more precisely, in 304. Veneration for them was ancient but their story is \"only known from fabulous acts.\" Lucy appears to be in reality the same as the Lucy of Syracuse whose feast is on 13 December, but the Geminian who was venerated on 16 September seems to be a fictitious character, not to be confused with Saint Geminianus, Bishop of Modena.\n\nQuestion: where was st. lucy born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On 30 November 1609, Galileo aimed his telescope at the Moon. Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632, although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done it before. Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (, ; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642), commonly referred to as Galileo, was an astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa, in modern-day Italy. Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and \"hydrostatic balances\".

With a Fontana's telescope, the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Zupi observed for the first time in 1630 the horizontal bands on the atmosphere of Jupiter and in 1639 the phases of Mercury, an evidence, together with the phases of Venus observed by Galileo in 1610, that the Copernicus's heliocentric theory was correct. With the help of the telescope providing a closer look into the sky, Galileo Galilei proved the heliocentric model of the Solar System. Galileo observed the phases of Venus's appearance with the telescope and was able to confirm Kepler's first law of planetary motion and Copernicus's heliocentric model. Galileo claimed that the Solar System is not only made up of the Sun, the Moon and the planets but also comets.\n\nQuestion: what objects did galileo see with his telescope?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
