You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

 An iconic rock legend, Jack Fate (Bob Dylan), is bailed out of prison to perform a one-man benefit concert for a decaying future North American society. The film touches on many subjects from the futility of politics, the confusion of loosely strung government conspiracies, and the chaos created by both anarchy and Nineteen Eighty-Four-styled totalitarianism. It further reflects on life, dreams, and God's place in a seemingly increasingly chaotic world. He produces no solutions to any of the problems the film presents. Rather, he makes it clear that he "stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago". He has parlayed this vocation into a successful book release that one day draws the attention of Angel Sanchez (Whitaker), a profoundly troubled man fixated on the "untimely" death of his mother. Angel needs much more than a simple life coach. Plagued by visions of his dead mother, a seance is held by Carter in order for Angel to say goodbye to his mother at which point he suffers a 

 The film follows the journey of K. Roth Binew, a self-proclaimed genius. After discovering that he has contracted a rare and unnamed terminal disease, he enlists his eccentric rickshaw-riding best and only friend Mills Joaquin (Jesse Eisenberg) to accompany him on his last day to live. Throughout the film, he attempts to find the meaning of life in "a brief, but powerful monologue" that his eccentric father had promised to tell him, but abandoned K. Roth before he could. K. Roth's final day begins with a confrontation with his neighbor and rival, Reginald, whom he invites to his living wake. With his friend Mills, he attempts to make his funeral arrangements, visits a "liquorsmith", and makes a goat sacrifice 

 Bertrand (Mathieu Amalric), a film director, is conducting research for his latest film, and asks a funeral director if he can stay back at his parlour after the close of business. Bertrand cannot resist getting into a coffin, and accidentally knocks the lid down, locking himself in. When he's released the following morning, it's clear he's been profoundly affected by the experience. That night, he considers hiring his regular prostitute, but cancels after a film on TV—David Cronenberg's eXistenZ – grabs his attention. The next day—still ignoring his girlfriend, Louise—Bertrand encounters a group of policeman on the street and is momentarily confused when he's 

Dead Ringers is a 1988 psychological horror film starring Jeremy Irons in a dual role as identical twin gynecologists. David Cronenberg directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Norman Snider. Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture. Actress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a "trifurcated cervix", meaning she probably will be unable to have children.

 An iconic rock legend, Jack Fate (Bob Dylan), is bailed out of prison to perform a one-man benefit concert for a decaying future North American society. The film touches on many subjects from the futility of politics, the confusion of loosely strung government conspiracies, and the chaos created by both anarchy and Nineteen Eighty-Four-styled totalitarianism. It further reflects on life, dreams, and God's place in a seemingly increasingly chaotic world. He produces no solutions to any of the problems the film presents. Rather, he makes it clear that he "stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago". He has parlayed this vocation into a successful book release that one day draws the attention of Angel Sanchez (Whitaker), a profoundly troubled man fixated on the "untimely" death of his mother. Angel needs much more than a simple life coach. Plagued by visions of his dead mother, a seance is held by Carter in order for Angel to say goodbye to his mother at which point he suffers a 

 The film follows the journey of K. Roth Binew, a self-proclaimed genius. After discovering that he has contracted a rare and unnamed terminal disease, he enlists his eccentric rickshaw-riding best and only friend Mills Joaquin (Jesse Eisenberg) to accompany him on his last day to live. Throughout the film, he attempts to find the meaning of life in "a brief, but powerful monologue" that his eccentric father had promised to tell him, but abandoned K. Roth before he could. K. Roth's final day begins with a confrontation with his neighbor and rival, Reginald, whom he invites to his living wake. With his friend Mills, he attempts to make his funeral arrangements, visits a "liquorsmith", and makes a goat sacrifice

Bertrand cannot resist getting into a coffin, and accidentally knocks the lid down, locking himself in. When he's released the following morning, it's clear he's been profoundly affected by the experience. That night, he considers hiring his regular prostitute, but cancels after a film on TV—David Cronenberg's eXistenZ – grabs his attention. The next day—still ignoring his girlfriend, Louise—Bertrand encounters a group of policeman on the street and is momentarily confused when he's

Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months).

 Depending on what an actor is doing, his or her heart rate will vary. This is the body's way of responding to stress. The body, most specifically the cardiovascular and muscular systems, experience significant metabolic demands from just one single bout of aerobic exercise. There are immediate and acute responses by the body as well as chronic adaptations, to the stresses of aerobic exercise. The acute responses by the cardiovascular and respiratory system are experienced in the transition between rest and the start of aerobic exercise. The stroke volume increases beginning at the onset of exercise, and similarly to heart rate, can increase with the anticipation of exercise. There is also an increase in blood pressure and blood flow. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during the rest between heart contractions, and can increase or decrease during exercise. During exercise, there is vasodilation in the active muscles, meaning the blood vessels leading to and in the active muscles dilate to allow more blood to come through and more oxygen to be transported. At the same time, there is vasoconstriction in the other organ systems as a mechanism of prioritization. Respiration also increases during aerobic exercise, obviously, to meet the new oxygen demands. Specifically, there are significant increases in the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues, carbon dioxide returned to the lungs, and minute ventilation, which is the volume of air breathed per minute. There is also an increase in the diffusion of oxygen from the capillaries into the tissues, as well as an increase in diffusion of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs. After long term aerobic training, the body adapts to become more efficient at meeting the metabolic demands. As the subject calms down, and as the body's inner core expands, allowing more blood to flow back to the extremities, the cycle will return to normal. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, athletes might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. The body uses this energy pathway for lower intensity exercise that lasts longer than three minutes, which corresponds to the rate at which the body produces ATP using oxygen. When we exercise, our muscles require more oxygen and nutrients to support their increased activity. To meet this demand, our bodies need to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. One of the ways our cardiovascular system responds to exercise is by increasing the heart rate. The ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is influenced by several physiological parameters, which are closely related to cardiovascular fitness. It is influenced by factors such as preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart), contractility (the force with which the heart contracts), and afterload (the resistance against which the heart has to pump). With regular aerobic exercise training, stroke volume increases, allowing for a greater delivery of oxygenated blood to the muscles. It reflects both cardiovascular fitness and muscle efficiency in using oxygen for energy production. Higher VO2 max values indicate better aerobic capacity and an increased ability to deliver oxygen to working muscles. Improvements in these physiological parameters through cardiovascular fitness training have several positive effects on muscular endurance. The rise in haemoglobin levels allows for a greater capacity for carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. Buffers in the bloodstream help regulate pH levels during exercise, reducing fatigue and improving performance. These changes contribute to an increase in stroke volume, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery. Aerobic training improves cardiovascular fitness by increasing endurance and enhancing the body's ability to utilize oxygen. Anaerobic training focuses on short bursts of intense activity and can improve cardiovascular fitness through adaptations such as increased stroke volume. Reference:

[2024-06-14 14:54:13,316] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis. There is evidence that corticosteroid injections may reduce pain for up to one month after the injection, which can have an impact on the formation of calcaneal spurs. Major symptoms consist of pain in the region surrounding the spur, which typically increases in intensity after prolonged periods of rest. Patients may not be able to bear weight on the afflicted heel comfortably. Spur outgrowths can be detected through physical exam followed by a lateral foot x-ray. In the conventional or allopathic system of medicine there is no cure for heel pain or calcaneal spur or heel spur. The patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines. Sometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. There are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. Thus remedies are tailor made unlike allopathy in which all patients receive the same surgery or drugs

Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity. There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts. While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan. In the case of a heel spur, added calcium to the heel bone (calcaneus). An irregular shape heel (calcaneus) can cause the tissue to twist (plantar ligament and Achilles tendon) or a smaller heel bone will put additional stress on tendons and ligaments. Everyone can be affected by heel spurs, however, certain groups of people have an increased risk. People who walk a lot are much more likely to have heel spurs or people who play golf or play tennis. Over-weight people are also more at risk for heel bone spurs as our feet are not designed to carry around extra weight. Major symptoms consist of pain in the region surrounding the spur, which typically increases in intensity after prolonged periods of rest. Patients may not be able to bear weight on the afflicted heel comfortably. A thorough history and physical exam is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of heel spurs and other foot conditions. X rays of the heel area are helpful, as excess bone production will be visible. This is most often done through an open procedure as any heel spur or bursa can be removed at the same time. If the spur is not removed during the surgery, it will probably be just

 Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS), is a compression neuropathy and painful foot condition in which the tibial nerve is compressed as it travels through the tarsal tunnel. This tunnel is found along the inner leg behind the medial malleolus (bump on the inside of the ankle). The posterior tibial artery, tibial nerve, and tendons of the tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus muscles travel in a bundle through the tarsal tunnel. Inside the tunnel, the nerve splits into three segments. One nerve (calcaneal) continues to the heel, the other two (medial and lateral plantar nerves) continue on to the bottom of the foot. The tarsal tunnel is delineated by bone on the inside and the flexor retinaculum on the outside. Patients with TTS typically complain of numbness in the foot radiating to the big toe and the first three 

Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the plantar fascia, which is the connective tissue which supports the arch of the foot. It is unclear if heel spurs have a role in causing plantar fasciitis even though they are commonly present in people who have the condition. The presentation of the symptoms is generally the basis for diagnosis; with ultrasound sometimes being useful if there is uncertainty. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis. If this is not sufficient, physiotherapy, orthotics, splinting, or steroid injections may be options. Individuals with plantar fasciitis often report their symptoms are most intense during their first steps after getting out of bed or after prolonged periods of sitting. Rare, but reported symptoms include numbness, tingling, swelling, or radiating pain. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the bottom of the foot. Risk factors Identified risk factors for plantar fasciitis include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods, high arches of the feet, the presence of a leg length inequality, and flat feet.

Following Lemmy's death in December 2015, Dee announced that Motörhead had disbanded. While King Diamond was touring with Motörhead, frontman Lemmy repeatedly asked Dee to join his band. In 1992, Dee accepted, replacing Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor. It's like when you get married and have kids; no one can take my father's place… I could never be Phil Taylor, so I had to introduce Mikkey Dee into Motörhead.'" He did not have much input on that year's March ör Die album which had been recorded with Tommy 

 Micael Kiriakos Delaoglou (born 31 October 1963), known professionally as Mikkey Dee, is a Swedish rock musician and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known as the last drummer for British rock band Motörhead from 1991 until its dissolution following the death of Lemmy in December 2015. From 1967 to 1968, he worked as the road manager for The Jimi Hendrix Experience, touring extensively and internationally with the band. During this time, Neville shared a flat with Jimi Hendrix's bass player Noel Redding and with Lemmy Kilmister of Hawkwind and Motörhead fame. Additionally, Neville secured a position for Lemmy as a roadie with the Hendrix band. From 1968-1969, he worked as assistant A&R to Peter Asher at Apple Records. Turner was with Wishbone Ash, known for their twin lead guitars, melodic songwriting and complex instrumental style, from its inception in 1969 until 1980, during which time he was a key songwriter and creative force within the band. He played on their classic album Argus to which he also contributed vocals as well the bulk of the album's lyrics. Turner's melodic basslines, where the instrument was often used as a third lead guitar, were an important part of the Wishbone Ash sound during the 1970s.

Following Lemmy's death in December 2015, Dee announced that Motörhead had disbanded. While King Diamond was touring with Motörhead, frontman Lemmy repeatedly asked Dee to join his band. In 1992, Dee accepted, replacing Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor. It's like when you get married and have kids; no one can take my father's place… I could never be Phil Taylor, so I had to introduce Mikkey Dee into Motörhead.'" He did not have much input on that year's March ör Die album which had been recorded with Tommy 

 Micael Kiriakos Delaoglou (born 31 October 1963), known professionally as Mikkey Dee, is a Swedish rock musician and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known as the last drummer for British rock band Motörhead from 1991 until its dissolution following the death of Lemmy in December 2015. From 1967 to 1968, he worked as the road manager for The Jimi Hendrix Experience, touring extensively and internationally with the band. During this time, Neville shared a flat with Jimi Hendrix's bass player Noel Redding and with Lemmy Kilmister of Hawkwind and Motörhead fame. Additionally, Neville secured a position for Lemmy as a roadie with the Hendrix band. From 1968-1969, he worked as assistant A&R to Peter Asher at Apple Records. Turner was with Wishbone Ash, known for their twin lead guitars, melodic songwriting and complex instrumental style, from its inception in 1969 until 1980, during which time he was a key songwriter and creative force within the band. He played on their classic album Argus to which he also contributed vocals as well the bulk of the album's lyrics. Turner's melodic basslines, where the instrument was often used as a third lead guitar, were an important part of the Wishbone Ash sound during the 1970s. In 1980, a decision by the rest of Wishbone Ash to introduce a frontman led to Turner parting company with Wishbone Ash.

In this game, he works with his friends to restore their world. For the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura decided to use Squall as a mentor character to newcomer Sora. Meanwhile, some parts of his design were changed to reference Rinoa's, most noticeably the wings in his jacket. Although polygons were used alongside other returning Final Fantasy characters, Leon could not return in Kingdom Hearts III which bothered many of the staff members. He was inspired to work on Kingdom Hearts by Nintendo's platforming game Super Mario 64. After discussing with the Disney staff, Nomura convinced them to use original characters with him as the character designer. The game's protagonist, Sora, became his favorite character he had designed so far. Following Kingdom Hearts, Nomura worked once again on the Final Fantasy series with Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy X-2. In addition to original locations, the Kingdom Hearts series features many worlds from Disney films. Sora must visit these worlds and interact with various Disney characters to protect them from enemies. This includes Moogles, small creatures who are another common element in the games. New characters were designed by Nomura and include Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless. A secret trailer in the first Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts Final Mix hinted

 Final Mix+, Nomura was approached by Disney which expressed interest in a sequel.

She is secretly working with her son Jathro to overthrow the Royal Family and become Nekron's permanent ruler. Wizards vs Aliens is a British science fantasy television programme produced by BBC Cymru Wales and FremantleMedia Enterprises for CBBC and created by Russell T Davies and Phil Ford. The series focuses on the exploits of 16-year-old wizard Tom Clarke (Scott Haran) and his scientifically-gifted best friend Benny Sherwood (Percelle Ascott) in their fight against the Nekross, a magic-consuming alien race who have arrived on Earth with the intention of hunting down wizards and feasting on their magical energies. Production-wise, Wizards vs Aliens was created to fill the schedule gap left by the Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures after its cancellation due to the death of the programme's lead Elisabeth Sladen. She appeared in films such as Peter's Friends (1992), Much Ado About Nothing (1993) (playing Ursula, alongside daughter Emma as Beatrice) and The Winter Guest (1997) (playing Elspeth, alongside daughter Emma as Frances). In 2004, she guest-starred in the Rosemary & Thyme episode entitled "Orpheus in the Undergrowth" as May Beauchamp. Her first television credit was in the 1973 Doctor Who story Planet of the Daleks. How has also played Lady Punnett 

 impeccably dressed and is known around the force as "Queen of the Dead"; her ring tone on Jane's phone appropriately plays Chopin's "Funeral March". She can analyze x-rays and blood chemistries and can slice open muscles and organs but possesses no scalpel with which to dissect human emotions. Maura also cannot lie; if she does, she breaks out in hives. This series featured the departures of six cast members, including Amanda Mealing as Connie Beauchamp, Azuka Oforka as Louise Tyler and Chelsea Halfpenny as Alicia Munroe. Chelsea Halfpenny portrays specialty registrar Alicia Munroe, who later specialises in pediatric emergency medicine. Charles Venn portrays senior staff nurse Jacob Masters, while Azuka Oforka features as staff nurse Louise Tyler, who is later promoted to senior staff nurse. Additionally, four cast members feature on the series in a recurring capacity: Rebecca Ryan features as porter Gemma Dean; Kai Thorne portrays Blake Gardner; Joe Gaminara appears as F1 doctor Eddie McAllister; and Di Botcher plays operational duty manager and paramedic Jan Jenning. Salt, who had returned during the previous series, decided to leave again, but was shocked to discover her character would die. She was glad that her departure was kept hidden and felt it had a greater impact. Halfpenny opted to leave her role as Alicia in 2018 after deciding to pursue other roles. Alicia departs in episode 20. Oforka also chose to leave her role as Louise, having appeared in the show since series 26.

2024-06-14 14:55:31 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Scott Haran as Thomas Robert "Tom" Clarke – A football-loving teenage wizard who defends wizardkind and Earth from the alien Nekross. ; Percelle Ascott as Benjamin Claude "Benny" Sherwood – Tom's nerdy "unenchanted" best friend whose vast knowledge of science finds its use with Tom's magic against the Nekross. ; Annette Badland as Ursula Crowe – Tom's happy-go-lucky grandmother and Michael's mother-in-law, a wizard descended from the Magical Line of Crowe. ; Dan Starkey as Randal Moon – A hobgoblin who lives in the Chamber of Crowe - the source of the Magical Line of Crowe's magic - and aids the Wizards and their unenchanted allies with his vast knowledge of potions and spells. Manpreet Bambra as Katie Lord – Tom and Benny's classmate and Tom's love interest, who is unaware that Tom is a Wizard. She briefly learns of Tom's nature as a wizard, but believing she couldn't handle the stress of worrying about him in his fight against the Nekross, asks him to perform a spell to wipe her memory. ; Victoria Wicks as Chancellor Kooth (Series 2) - A Nekross who temporarily ruled Nekron whilst the Royal Family travelled the universe seeking magic. She is secretly working with her son Jathro to overthrow the Royal Family and become Nekron's permanent ruler. Wizards vs Aliens is a British science fantasy television programme produced by BBC Cymru Wales and FremantleMedia Enterprises for CBBC and created by Russell T Davies and Phil Ford. The series focuses on the exploits of 16-year-old wizard Tom Clarke (Scott Haran) and his scientifically-gifted best friend Benny Sherwood (Percelle Ascott) in their fight against the Nekross, a magic-consuming alien race who have arrived on Earth with the intention of hunting down wizards and feasting on their magical energies. Production-wise, Wizards vs Aliens was created to fill the schedule gap left by the Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures after its cancellation due to the death of the programme's lead Elisabeth Sladen. She appeared in films such as Peter's Friends (1992), Much Ado About Nothing (1993) (playing Ursula, alongside daughter Emma as Beatrice) and The Winter Guest (1997) (playing Elspeth, alongside daughter Emma as Frances). In 2004, she guest-starred in the Rosemary & Thyme episode entitled "Orpheus in the Undergrowth" as May Beauchamp. Her first television credit was in the 1973 Doctor Who story Planet of the Daleks.

She can analyze x-rays and blood chemistries and can slice open muscles and organs but possesses no scalpel with which to dissect human emotions. Maura also cannot lie; if she does, she breaks out in hives.

Both he and Harry like to compose poetry, and their friendship leads them to form an inclusive group, ‘the Uglies’, through which the two boys can express their adolescent sense 

 Lavender Brown is a Gryffindor student in Harry's year. In Order of the Phoenix, she initially believes the Ministry's smear campaign against Harry, but is among the original members of Dumbledore's Army. Lavender becomes jealous of Ron's

Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being kept within the school. Hermione and impressing Slughorn, who awards him a Liquid Luck potion. Ron makes the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper and begins dating Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione.

David Roberts from GamesRadar gave the game 8/10, praising the familiar Civilization gameplay, rewarding quests, and affinities, which change how players approach the new world's alien resources, but criticizing the game for being too similar to its predecessors, as well as the late game for being less interesting than opening turns. The game's setting is unique to the Civilization series in that it takes place in the future, with mankind traveling through space and founding colonies on extraterrestrial planets after Earth becomes uninhabitable due to an undescribed disaster known as "the Great Mistake".
