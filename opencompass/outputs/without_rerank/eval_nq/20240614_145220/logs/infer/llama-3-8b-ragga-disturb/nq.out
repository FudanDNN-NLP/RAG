Because of the nature of radio wave propagation, communications made via short-wave radio can be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment and knowledge. One disadvantage may be that one requires training and licensing to transmit using a short-wave radio, in many countries. The usual method is that a ship calls a shore station, and the shore station's marine operator connects the caller to the public switched telephone network. This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet. Most shore stations monitor several frequencies. The frequencies with the longest range are usually near 20 MHz, but the ionospheric weather (propagation) can dramatically change which frequencies work best. Single-sideband (SSB) is used because the short wave bands are 

 Microbroadcasting is the process of broadcasting a message to a relatively small audience. This is not to be confused with low-power broadcasting. Microbroadcasting, in radio terms, is the use of low-power transmitters (often Title 47 CFR Part 15 in the United States, or its equivalent elsewhere) to broadcast a radio signal over the space of a neighborhood or small town. Similar to pirate radio broadcasting, microbroadcasters generally operate without a license from the local regulation body, but sacrifice range in favor of using legal power limits (for example, 100 mW for medium wave broadcasts in the United States). Microbroadcasting is also used by schools and businesses to serve just the immediate campus of the operation; well-known uses include audio tour guide systems, airport information services, and drive-in theaters, which often provide movie audio over the driver's car audio system. At this time, not all of their antennas appear to be in use. Their main targeted services are titled Global-I through Global-IV. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30 MHz (100 to 10 metres); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band. This is called skywave or "skip" propagation. Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication, in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines (line-of-sight propagation) and are limited by the visual horizon, about 64 km (40 miles). Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas; sometimes entire continents or beyond. Therefore, they are used in point-to-point terrestrial communications links, limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 miles (48–64 km). They are also used for communication with spacecraft since the waves are not refracted (bent) when passing through the ionosphere like lower frequencies. The wavelength 

  In times of crisis and natural disasters, amateur radio is often used as a means of emergency communication when wireline, cell phones and other conventional means of communications fail. Unlike commercial systems, amateur radio is usually independent of terrestrial facilities that can fail. Similar to short-wave, this type of communication is also able to be intercepted and heard by anyone with the proper equipment. However, unlike short-wave, this communication equipment is restricted by range (usually several miles, at most), but is relatively simple to operate and the main power source is usually provided by batteries. Additionally, many non-professionals may use unlicensed two-way radios, as is common with CB radio, Family Radio Service or PMR446.

[2024-06-14 14:53:06,713] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in 

 erosion. The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in Egypt as the khamsin, on the Mediterranean as the sirocco, it is called on the Guinea coast the harmattan. Similar dry winds blow from the Kalahari Desert in the south.

2024-06-14 14:53:06 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in 

 erosion. The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in Egypt as the khamsin, on the Mediterranean as the sirocco, it is called on the Guinea coast the harmattan. Similar dry winds blow from the Kalahari Desert in the south.

The  Philadelphia Eagles season was the franchise's 79th season in the National Football League, and the thirteenth under head coach Andy Reid. They also swept the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins for the first time since 2006 and 2009, respectively. The Eagles played all their home games at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On September 27, 2014, Peters was fined $10,000. On June 14, 2017, Peters signed a one-year contract extension with the Eagles through the 2019 season. On October 23, 2017, during Monday Night Football against the Redskins, Peters left the game with an apparent right knee injury. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.

Co-written, directed, and co-produced by Andrei Konchalovsky, the film stars Elle Fanning, Nathan Lane, and John Turturro with Charles Rowe and Shirley Henderson as the Nutcracker. It was universally panned by critics upon its release, and was criticized for its story, deviations from the ballet, performances, twisted visuals, and the rats' similarities to Nazis. Most romantic and classical ballets of the 19th century were narrative ballets. Among the most well known are Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. For these and other classic narrative ballets it is common for ballet directors to create their own choreography, while maintaining the plot and music used by the original 19th-century choreographer. Narrative ballets are essential to a ballet company's repertoire, because they tend to generate the highest sales and bring families with children to see the ballet.

The Classic Nutcracker: First performed in 1987 before the official founding of Ballet Minnesota, The Classic Nutcracker has become a tradition for countless families in the Twin Cities area. "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King" (Nussknacker und Mausekönig) is a story written in 1816 by Prussian author E. T. A. Hoffmann, in which young Marie Stahlbaum's favorite Christmas toy, the Nutcracker, comes alive and, after defeating the evil Mouse King in battle, whisks her away to a magical kingdom populated by dolls. In 1892, the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov turned Alexandre Dumas's adaptation of the story into the ballet The Nutcracker. The film's score is derived from Tchaikovsky's original music for The Nutcracker, the ballet version of the E.T.A. Many of the songs are based on the ballet's dances. 6

Choreography: Alexander Gorsky (after Petipa) ; Company: Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow ; Premiere: 1919  Russian choreographer Alexander Gorsky, who staged a production of The Nutcracker in Moscow in 1919, is credited with the idea of combining Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy's roles (i.e. giving the Fairy's dances to Clara), eliminating the Sugar Plum Fairy's Cavalier, giving the Cavalier's dances to the Nutcracker Prince, and having the roles of Clara and the Nutcracker Prince danced by adults, thereby introducing a reason for a love interest between the two characters that had not been present in the original ballet. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's popular 1892 ballet The Nutcracker is derived from E. T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. The ballet's scenario, crafted by Ivan Vsevolozhsky and Marius Petipa after a French adaptation by Alexandre Dumas, is far simpler and less nuanced than Hoffmann's original story. Vsevolozhsky and Petipa entirely omitted the Nutcracker character's complex backstory, "The Story of the Hard Nut," and expanded a short, satiric passage set in a Kingdom of Sweets to cover the whole of Act II. Clara and her Prince travel to the Land Of Peace and Harmony instead of visiting the Sugar Plum Fairy, to fit the company's theme of international and cultural unity.

 superhuman strength. As the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z) and sequels (Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super), as well as many 

 were a defeated Gohan and Goku, Frieza's henchmen fighting against Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, Master Roshi and Krillin. It also features Jaco from Toriyama's 2013 manga series Jaco the Galactic Patrolman, which is set before Dragon Ball. Additionally, there is a two-part original video animation created as strategy guides for the 1993 video game Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans, which was remade in 2010 and included with the Raging Blast 2 video game. As with the franchise's anime television series, all twenty films and the first three TV specials were licensed in North America by Funimation. In Europe, AB Groupe licensed the second and third Dragon Ball movies, the first nine Z movies and the first two TV specials. Dragon Ball is one of the most successful franchises in animation history. The anime series is broadcast in more than 80countries worldwide. The alien Sorbet, commander of the remnants of Frieza's military, travels to Earth where the Pilaf Gang are forced to collect and use the magical Dragon Balls to summon the wish-granting eternal dragon Shenron to resurrect Frieza. Upon learning that Goku has grown far more powerful over time, Frieza postpones the invasion so 

 Dragon Ball is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. Four anime instalments based on the franchise have been produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball (1986); Dragon Ball Z (1989); Dragon Ball GT (1996); and Dragon Ball Super (2015); followed by the web series Super Dragon Ball Heroes (2018). Since 1986, twenty theatrical animated films based on the franchise have been released: four based on the original Dragon Ball anime, fifteen based on Dragon Ball Z and one based on Dragon Ball Super. A two-part hour-long crossover TV special between Dragon Ball Z, One Piece and Toriko aired 

 Frieza first and quickly gains the advantage but the latter deduces that he is holding back, so the two foes agree to fight at full power. After Frieza's death, Vegeta later unites with the heroes to thwart greater threats to the universe, most notably Cell, Majin Buu, Beerus, Zamasu and Broly. Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes from villain to antihero and later as one of the heroes, while remaining a rival to Goku.

 The eye is able to detect a visual stimulus when the photons (light packets) cause a photopigment molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. This is called adaptation. Each part of the eye plays a special role in the visual process that allows us to see. The eye can be thought of like an instant camera, only without the need to wait for the image to develop – light rays reflected off an object are processed into an image that we see in real time. The iris acts like the diaphragm on a camera to control the size of the pupil. When there is a lot of bright light, our iris reduces the size of the pupil to let less light in. On the other hand, in low-light environments, the iris lets the pupil increase in size (i.e. dilate) to allow more light into the eye. The cornea and lens work together to focus the light rays onto special light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye – known as the retina – which is like the film of a camera. Cells in the retina convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, for processing, allowing us to see the image. Continuously produced by the ciliary body, the aqueous humour then drains through the trabecular meshwork at the drainage angle to keep eye pressure at a normal level. This blood supply ensures that the retina and back of the eye are well nourished. The muscles in the ciliary body alter the shape of the lens when focusing – they contract when looking at nearby objects and relax when looking at faraway objects. This process is called accommodation. The cornea is a curved, clear layer that forms the front of the eye – it can be thought of as the eye’s ‘windscreen’. Light enters the eye through the cornea, which then bends (refracts) the rays before they pass further through the eye. The cornea acts as the lens of the camera, while the pupillary diameter functions like the aperture. It has a layer of photoreceptors within its protective casing, which respond to light. The lens system of the eye helps to focus light onto these photoreceptors. This process is known as accommodation. The retina is intricate in its organization. It contains a layer of photoreceptor cells known as rods and cones. The electrical responses produced by rods and cones are crucial in vision.

From there, visual information is transmitted to the thalamus and then to the visual cortex in the brain. These two processes are essential for optimal vision.

Since the 18th century, a number of attempts have been made to locate treasure and artifacts. Theories about artifacts present on the island range from pirate treasure to Shakespearean manuscripts to possibly the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, with the Grail and the Ark having been buried there by the Knights Templar. Various items have surfaced over the years that were found on the island, some of which have since been carbon-dated and found to be hundreds of years old. "The curse" is said to have originated more than a century ago and states that seven men will die in the search for the treasure before it is found. in Oak Island Tours announced on their website that the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and Department of Tourism, Culture and Heritage had granted them a treasure-trove license which allowed them to resume activities until December 31, 2010. After December 2010, the departments repealed the treasure-trove license and replaced it with an Oak Island Treasure Act. The act, which became effective on January 1, 2011, allows treasure hunting to continue on the island under the terms of a licence issued by the Minister of Natural Resources. The Curse of Oak Island is a multi-season reality television series that chronicles an eclectic team of treasure hunters and their search for legendary treasure on the infamous Oak Island, off the shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. The show features what is known as the Oak Island mystery, showing efforts to search for historical artifacts and treasure. The rate of tidal rise and fall in the area is the second highest in the world: only that of Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia is greater. A rocky causeway connecting the island to the mainland is uncovered for approximately 3 hours either side of low tide, the island being cut off from the mainland for the rest of the day. This makes Sully Island a potentially dangerous place, and many people have been swept to their deaths while trying

In 1866, a group known as The Oak Island Eldorado Company or more commonly The Halifax Company was formed to find the treasure. By this time, there were many shafts, bore holes, and tunnels under Oak Island made by previous treasure hunters.

2024-06-14 14:53:11 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Oak Island Mystery refers to stories of buried treasure and unexplained objects found on or near Oak Island in Nova Scotia. Since the 18th century, a number of attempts have been made to locate treasure and artifacts. Theories about artifacts present on the island range from pirate treasure to Shakespearean manuscripts to possibly the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, with the Grail and the Ark having been buried there by the Knights Templar. Various items have surfaced over the years that were found on the island, some of which have since been carbon-dated and found to be hundreds of years old. "The curse" is said to have originated more than a century ago and states that seven men will die in the search for the treasure before it is found. in Oak Island Tours announced on their website that the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources and Department of Tourism, Culture and Heritage had granted them a treasure-trove license which allowed them to resume activities until December 31, 2010. After December 2010, the departments repealed the treasure-trove license and replaced it with an Oak Island Treasure Act. The act, which became effective on January 1, 2011, allows treasure hunting to continue on the island under the terms of a licence issued by the Minister of Natural Resources. The Curse of Oak Island is a multi-season reality television series that chronicles an eclectic team of treasure hunters and their search for legendary treasure on the infamous Oak Island, off the shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. The show features what is known as the Oak Island mystery, showing efforts to search for historical artifacts and treasure. The rate of tidal rise and fall in the area is the second highest in the world: only that of Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia is greater. A rocky causeway connecting the island to the mainland is uncovered for approximately 3 hours either side of low tide, the island being cut off from the mainland for the rest of the day. This makes Sully Island a potentially dangerous place, and many people have been swept to their deaths while trying

In 1866, a group known as The Oak Island Eldorado Company or more commonly The Halifax Company was formed to find the treasure. By this time, there were many shafts, bore holes, and tunnels under Oak Island made by previous treasure hunters. When a plan to shut off the alleged flood tunnels from Smith's Cove didn't work, the company decided to shift focus to the original main shaft. The shaft later collapsed, and the

The canaliculi join each other to form larger and larger structures, sometimes referred to as the canals of Hering, which themselves join to form small bile ductules that have an epithelial surface. Gallstone ileus is a rare form of small bowel obstruction caused by an impaction of a gallstone within the lumen of the small intestine. Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name "gallstone ileus" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone). Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. Some studies indicate that people with porcelain gallbladder have a high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, but other studies question this. The gall bladder serves as a storage organ for bile, a fluid produced by the liver. It is located near the liver and has three portions: the fundus, body, and neck. The neck of the gall bladder connects with the liver via the hepatic duct. When stimulated, the gall bladder releases its secretion, which is bile, into the small intestine through the common bile duct. The gall bladder is lined with a simple columnar epithelial tissue, and its walls are composed of three visible coats: an internal mucous and muscular coat, a middle connective tissue layer, and an outermost serous membrane. The main function of the gall bladder is to store and concentrate bile. Bile, produced by the hepatocytes in the liver, is transported to the gall bladder for temporary storage. While in the gall bladder, the bile undergoes concentration until it is ready to be released into the small intestine. During a fatty meal, the gall bladder contracts to release bile into the small intestine to emulsify fats and neutralize the acids in the partially-digested food. However, it is important to note that the formation of gallstones is a common issue associated with the gall bladder due to its high cholesterol content. In some cases, when gallstones cause complications or persistent symptoms, a surgical procedure called cholecystectomy may be necessary to remove the gall bladder. Porcelain gallbladder is a calcification of the gallbladder believed to be brought on by excessive gallstones, although the exact cause is not clear. As with gallstone disease in general, this condition occurs predominantly in overweight female patients of middle age. It is a morphological variant of chronic cholecystitis. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the recommended treatment. Its function is to collect and store bile, a dark green/yellow fluid that assists with the breakdown of fat.The gall bladder is a pear-shaped sac on the underside of the liver.The hepatocytes also produce bile, which is transported through ducts to the gall bladder.Hepatocyte cells lining the sinusoids detoxify the blood, which flows back to the heart through the inferior vena cava.In humans the caecum is about 10 centimetres (4 inches) in length, but in animals the caecum/appendix can be very long; for example, in horses it can measure up to 1 metre (3 feet 4 inches) and contains enzymes for processing grass-based food.

 The United States Mint has issued legal tender coins every year from 1792 to the present.

The two winning designs were unveiled on October 11, 2018, at the NASM in Washington, DC, in the presence of dignitaries such as Mint Director David J. Ryder and Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham. At the unveiling, Ryder stated the five-ounce silver dollars, once placed on sale, could sell out in ten minutes. The Coinage Act of 1792 (also known as the Mint Act; officially: An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States), passed by the United States Congress on April 2, 1792, created the United States dollar as the country's standard unit of money, established the United States Mint, and regulated the coinage of the United States.

 The San Francisco Mint is a branch of the United States Mint and was opened in 1854 to serve the gold mines of the California Gold Rush. The five original officers of the U.S. Mint were a Director, an Assayer, a Chief Coiner, an Engraver, and a Treasurer (not the same as the Secretary of the Treasury). The Act allowed that one person could perform the functions of Chief Coiner and Engraver. The Assayer, Chief Coiner and Treasurer were required to post a $10,000 bond with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Act pegged the newly created United States dollar to the value of the widely used Spanish silver dollar, saying it was to have "the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current". Demand grew for a mint closer to the mines. Senator James W. Nesmith introduced an unsuccessful bill in 1862 to create a mint in Portland, Oregon.

Examples include lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide NMC, or lithium iron phosphate olivine which can be combined with most anodes such as graphite, lithium titanate spinel, titanium oxide, silicon, or intermetallic insertion materials to create a working electrochemical cell. lithium-ion (and the mechanistically similar lithium polymer) batteries, were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. The first commercialized lithium-ion chemistry was a lithium cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode first demonstrated by N. Godshall in 1979, and by John Goodenough, and Akira Yoshino shortly thereafter. Due to the volatility of organic electrolytes, the presence of highly oxidized metal oxides, and the thermal instability of the anode SEI layer, traditional lithium-ion batteries pose a fire safety risk if punctured or charged improperly. These early cells did not 

 In 2014, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that creating high lithium content lithium-ion batteries materials with cation disorder among the electroactive metals could achieve 660 watt-hours per kilogram at 2.5 volts. The materials of the stoichiometry Li2MO3-LiMO2 are similar to the lithium rich lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) materials but without the cation ordering. In 2000, researchers from the Université de Picardie Jules Verne examined the use of nano-sized transition-metal oxides as conversion anode materials.

Disadvantages are the high costs and the limited resources of cobalt and nickel. It is estimated that the NCA battery of Model 3 contains between 4.5 and 9.5 kg of cobalt and 11.6 kg of lithium. Lithium nickel oxide LiNiO2, which is closely related to NCA, or nickel oxide NiO2 itself, cannot yet be used as a battery material because they are mechanically unstable, shows a rapid loss of capacity and have safety issues.

2024-06-14 14:53:13 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Several varieties of cathode exist, but typically they can easily divided into two categories, namely charged and discharged. Examples include lithium cobalt oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide NMC, or lithium iron phosphate olivine which can be combined with most anodes such as graphite, lithium titanate spinel, titanium oxide, silicon, or intermetallic insertion materials to create a working electrochemical cell. lithium-ion (and the mechanistically similar lithium polymer) batteries, were initially developed and commercialized for use in laptops and consumer electronics. The first commercialized lithium-ion chemistry was a lithium cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode first demonstrated by N. Godshall in 1979, and by John Goodenough, and Akira Yoshino shortly thereafter. Due to the volatility of organic electrolytes, the presence of highly oxidized metal oxides, and the thermal instability of the anode SEI layer, traditional lithium-ion batteries pose a fire safety risk if punctured or charged improperly. These early cells did not

 The story takes place in Branson County, North Carolina. The town lives a rather typical southern lifestyle in which the town members carry on their usual business such as working and chatting with others within the town. After the situation escalates, Joey flees from his violent father and joins Perry. The serious side of life is catching up, the gang is falling apart, and Richie is staying behind. The novel is set in Zephyr, Alabama, a fictional town near the Tecumseh River. Zephyr is a small town that is populated with people who work both at the paper mill up river and for the local dairy.

Richie Gennaro is the 17-year-old leader of the Wanderers, an Italian-American youth gang in the Bronx in 1962. His girlfriend is Denise Rizzo. Richie's friends in the Wanderers are Joey Capra, Buddy Borsalino, Eugene Caputo and Perry LaGuardia.

How much hop bitterness and aroma is appropriate varies between beer styles. There are many varieties of hops, some of which are associated with beers from specific regions. Most hops are sourced from Yakima Valley and water comes from the Cedar River watershed in the Cascade Mountains. Popular brews include Universale Pale Ale, Interurban IPA, and Abominable Winter Ale. The Bourbon Abominable Winter Ale won a bronze at the 2012 World Beer Cup. The malted barley comes from Great Western Malting in Pocatello, Idaho and their hops come from Washington. Also known as hop houses or hop kilns, hop barns were very common in areas of the United States where hops were grown. In New York state's "hop belt" numerous hop barns were constructed between the early 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Ostego, Chenango, Madison, Oneida, Montgomery and Schoharie Counties were the primary areas contained within the hop belt. As hops production basically dwindled down to only Washington state, in the U.S., the remaining hop houses elsewhere have begun to disappear.

Hops possess properties that can regulate and balance hormonal activity, which may have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions like breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or endometriosis. It's important to note that hops plants are aggressive vines that can grow over 5 meters (16 feet) and necessitate time-consuming pruning and staking.

The pearl industry is so important in some areas, significant sums of money are spent on monitoring the health of farmed molluscs. The benthic ecology of the region is a significant factor in the rate of production and the quality of pearls. Stronger currents cause faster but lower quality pearl development. The oysters are harvested wild from coral reefs and are also commonly grown in aquaculture, both primarily taking place in the Indo-Pacific region. Pearl farming in China is mainly concentrated in the southeastern part of the country, with the waterways of Zhejiang province serving as the source for China's freshwater pearls. Production has greatly increased through the 1990s and 2000s, with China, according to Times Online, producing 90% of pearl necklaces globally. Times Online indicated that in 2007 "China produced 1,600 tonnes of pearls..., more than 95 per cent of world production." According to the Gems and Jewelry Trade Association of China China produced in 2007, "1,600 tons of pearls - over 95 percent of the world's total output". Pearling in Bangladesh has existed for centuries. Bangladesh is famous for natural pink pearls, locally known as “mukta”. Pearl farming takes place mainly in the southeastern region of the country, in an area stretching from Comilla District to the coastal Cox's Bazar District. The port city of Chittagong is a historic center of the pearl trade. Bangladeshi pearl production is small compared to other major producers. After the patent was granted in 1916, the technology was immediately commercially applied to akoya pearl oysters in Japan in 1916. Mitsubishi's Baron Iwasaki immediately applied the technology to the South Sea pearl oyster in 1917 in the Philippines, and later in Buton and Palau. Today, a hybrid mollusk is used in both Japan and China in the production of akoya pearls. Most cultured freshwater pearls are baroque because freshwater pearls are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical, nucleation bead. Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the depth of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl. Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, which, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls. Western Australia is currently the world's largest cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima gold-lipped oysters, whereas Tahiti is the number one cultivator of pearls from Pinctada maxima black-lipped oysters. South Sea and Tahitian pearl oysters, as Pinctada maxima and Pinctada margaritifera, respectively, which survive the subsequent surgery to remove the finished pearl, are often implanted with a new, larger bead as part of the same procedure, and then returned to the water for another 2–3 years of growth.

The cartel preceded easily by three decades the birth of another cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was formed in 1960. Creation of the Gas OPEC was one of the topics of the first GECF summit. According to GECF General Secretary Yuri Sentyurin, the issue of creating the creation of a "gas OPEC " is regularly raised at ministerial meetings. In addition, the forum was originally conceived as a discussion platform, therefore, without changing the Charter, it is premature to talk about practical instruments by analogy with OPEC.

  OPEC is an alliance among 14 diverse oil-producing countries (as of January 2019: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela) to manage the supply of oil. OPEC's power was consolidated in the 1960s and 1970s as various countries nationalized their oil holdings, and wrested decision-making away from the "Seven Sisters" (Anglo-Iranian, Socony, Royal Dutch Shell, Gulf, Esso, Texaco, Socal), and created their own oil companies to control the oil. OPEC often tries to influence prices by restricting production. It does this by allocating each member country a quota for production.

The jeep can only carry a fixed and limited amount of fuel, but it can leave fuel and collect fuel at fuel dumps anywhere in the desert. The jeep problem is related to several other optimization problems: 

 The Jeepster Commando is an automobile which was first produced by Kaiser Jeep in 1966 to compete with the International Scout, Toyota Land Cruiser and Ford Bronco. Four different models were available: a pickup truck, convertible, roadster and wagon. The Jeepster remained in production after American Motors Corporation (AMC) bought the Jeep line from Kaiser in 1970. After AMC's acquisition, the Jeepster Commando C101 (101" wheelbase) steadily grew in popularity. The Jeepster is an ancestor of the modern Jeep family produced by Chrysler.

Various folk cultures and traditions assign symbolic meaning to the rose, though these are seldom understood in-depth. Examples of common meanings of different coloured roses are: true love (red), mystery (blue), innocence or purity (white), death (black), friendship (yellow), and passion (orange). In William Blake's poem "The Sick Rose" the rose is a symbol for love or passion, it is crimson and dark but now sick, the worm has infected it. The rose in the popular 13th-century French poem "Romance of the Rose" is a personification of the woman, the object of the lover's attentions, and his plucking of the rose represents his conquest of her. In the title of William Faulkner's short story "A Rose for Emily" the rose has a number of possible meanings: as Emily's lover now dried and preserved, or a secret as per sub rosa.

Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel about a talented young man from a poor background who strives to win the unattainable rich girl. Set on Long Island, the wealthy Daisy Buchanan falls in love with Jay Gatsby, an Army captain. While Gatsby fights in the war, Daisy is pressured by her family to marry Tom Buchanan, a man of their social set. Five years pass, and Gatsby now owns a huge estate on Long Island. Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, rents Gatsby's gate house for the summer. Gatsby hosts lavish parties and seeks to reconnect with Daisy.

F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" explores several themes and issues that are relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape. However, Fitzgerald's portrayal of the American Dream in "The Great Gatsby" reveals its limitations and challenges the notion that it is equally accessible to everyone. The novel depicts the vast income inequality that existed in the 1920s and highlights how the American Dream is often only attainable for a fortunate few, while remaining out of reach for the majority. Fitzgerald delves into the extravagance and decadence of the Jazz Age, portraying a society that is obsessed with wealth, glamour, and social status. Through characters like Jay Gatsby and the Buchanans, he critiques the emptiness and moral decay that can accompany the relentless pursuit of wealth and the superficiality of material possessions. Furthermore, "The Great Gatsby" delves into the complexities of love and desire. The novel examines the illusions and fantasies that can be constructed around love, particularly in relation to the character of Gatsby and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan. The novel also touches on themes of identity, loneliness, and the loss of innocence. Overall, "The Great Gatsby" is a complex and multi-layered work that explores themes and issues relevant to both the American experience and the global literary landscape.

 Smith's sixth novel, Nick, was published on January 5, 2021 by Little, Brown and Company. It is a prequel to The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's landmark 1925 novel. The Great Gatsbys U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered the public domain in the United States. Nick centers on the narrator of The Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway, in the years before the events of Fitzgerald's novel. It follows Nick Carraway as a soldier in World War I, his detours in Paris, and his time in New Orleans before his move up to Long Island. After discovering that the home of his childhood is currently owned by Polish immigrants, he and his daughter Candace, an architect, find what she calls "the most beautiful house in America." The house and the land are passed along from generation to generation and are eventually inherited by Judith Oakes. Although The Great Gatsby received a poor reception in the author's lifetime, it is now considered to be one of the greatest novels in American history.

[2024-06-14 14:53:26,968] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:  Hotel luxury is often denoted by stars. Other classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel rating levels. Hotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization. In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes. These hotels may attract both business conferences and vacationing tourists and offer more than a convenient place to stay. These hotels may be referred to as major conference center hotels, flagship hotels, destination hotels, and destination resorts. The market for conference and resort hotels is a subject for market analysis. These hotels as destinations may be characterized by distinctive architecture, upscale lodgings, ballrooms, large conference facilities, restaurants, and recreation activities such as golf or skiing. Newer hostels focus on a more trendy design interior, some of which are on par with boutique hotels. Some may cater to older digital nomads, global nomads, and perpetual travelers that prefer slightly more upmarket private rooms or a quieter atmosphere. The structure was purchased by two local real estate development companies in 2008 and converted to a hotel. The hotel, branded as and managed by Capella Hotels and Resorts, opened in 2013 as the Cappella Hotel.

The hotel has 61 rooms in total, including 12 suites and 49 standard guest rooms. The hotel has about 42000 sqft of interior space. The hotel offers the 70-seat Grill Room for dining, and the 26-seat Rye Bar for relaxation and consumption of alcohol.

The Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott Hotels at L.A. Live opened February 2010 and share the first skyscraper built since the early 1990s in Downtown Los Angeles. The Ritz-Carlton, Los Angeles was awarded a LEED silver certification. The 68-room luxury boutique hotel is designed by Hirsch Bedner Associates and offers nine different room types and state-of-the-art in-room technology. It is the only five-star luxury accommodation available in the area of Suncorp Stadium and Paddington. The third level of the hotel has a Sunset Lounge terrace that is available for dinners. The hotel restaurants include the 24-hour multi-cuisine Threesixtyone and Amaranta which serves speciality coastal Indian cuisine. The property also has a bar termed as 'The Piano Bar', a cigar lounge and a spa. More recent constructions, however, have moved away from the outbuilding style and instead have a more traditional layout with all suites in the same building. The suites are much larger than traditional hotel rooms, however. The first Residence Inn to bear the Marriott name was in Charlotte, North Carolina. In contrast to Marriott's other extended-stay brand, the low-cost TownePlace Suites, Residence Inn competes in the upscale industry segment, along with InterContinental's Staybridge Suites, Hyatt House, and Homewood Suites by Hilton. The hotel contains 453 rooms in five buildings on 5 acre of property. It has three restaurants on the property - House Without a Key, Orchids, and La Mer. The hotel is a member of both The Leading Hotels of the World and Imperial Hotel, Ltd., marketing and trade associations geared toward luxury hotels. It received Four Stars from Mobil Travel Guide and a AAA Four Diamonds rating. The hotel is currently owned and operated by the Japanese company Mitsui Fudosan. The hotel's boutique sister property, Waikiki Parc, is located across the street.

Question: what are three different types of hotel properties
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:53:26 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:  Hotel luxury is often denoted by stars. Other classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel rating levels. Hotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization. In recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes. These hotels may attract both business conferences and vacationing tourists and offer more than a convenient place to stay. These hotels may be referred to as major conference center hotels, flagship hotels, destination hotels, and destination resorts. The market for conference and resort hotels is a subject for market analysis. These hotels as destinations may be characterized by distinctive architecture, upscale lodgings, ballrooms, large conference facilities, restaurants, and recreation activities such as golf or skiing. Newer hostels focus on a more trendy design interior, some of which are on par with boutique hotels. Some may cater to older digital nomads, global nomads, and perpetual travelers that prefer slightly more upmarket private rooms or a quieter atmosphere. The structure was purchased by two local real estate development companies in 2008 and converted to a hotel. The hotel, branded as and managed by Capella Hotels and Resorts, opened in 2013 as the Cappella Hotel. The developers sold the property to Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, which rebranded the hotel as the Rosewood Washington, D.C. The hotel has 61 rooms in total, including 12 suites and 49 standard guest rooms. The hotel has about 42000 sqft of interior space. The hotel offers the 70-seat Grill Room for dining, and the 26-seat Rye Bar for relaxation and consumption of alcohol.

The process by which a sperm fuses with the zona pellucida and completes capacitation involves several steps. First, as the sperm passes through the woman's reproductive tract, its acrosome fuses with its plasma membrane, leading to the release of acrosomal enzymes. During this process, the heads of several sperm fuse with the zona pellucida. However, only one successful sperm will be able to penetrate the egg. This fusion of the sperm with the zona pellucida is known as the acrosome reaction, marking the completion of capacitation. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary changes in the sperm's plasma membrane, enabling the release of acrosomal enzymes.

The process whereby a sperm fuses with the zona, the second state of capacitation, is called the _acrosome reaction_. The sperm require from five to 10 hours of incubation in the fluids of the female reproductive tract to complete the acrosome reaction. It is believed that the passage of sperm through the cervical mucus around the time of ovulation promotes the necessary physical, chemical, and structural changes in the plasma membrane to facilitate release of acrosomal enzymes. The sperm sheds its body and tail upon penetration, and only the head (containing the genetic material) actually enters the egg. Figure 2-8 illustrates the following steps in the capacitation-fertilization process:

• **Phase 1:** The plasma membrane fuses with the acrosome as the sperm pass into the reproductive tract to reach the egg, thus initiating capacitation. The oviduct, also known as the fallopian tube, is the site where fertilization typically takes place. Along this journey, if fertilization occurs, it usually happens within the ampulla or the widest part of the oviduct. For fertilization to occur, the sperm needs to enter the oviduct and meet the egg. The sperm's journey towards the egg is facilitated by several factors such as the release of cervical mucus that allows sperm to swim more easily and the contraction of the fallopian tube muscles, which help move the sperm towards the egg. This usually happens through a process known as the acrosome reaction, where enzymes released by the sperm help break down the zona pellucida, allowing the sperm to reach the egg. This is an essential step for successful fertilization since only mature eggs can be fertilized by sperm. Once fertilization occurs, the genetic material of the sperm combines with the genetic material of the egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The oviduct provides the necessary environment for the sperm and egg to meet, allowing for the formation of a zygote and the beginning of pregnancy. Sperm competition is the competitive process between spermatozoa of two or more different males to fertilize the same egg during sexual reproduction. Sperm competition is an evolutionary pressure on males, and has led to the development of adaptations to increase males' chance of reproductive success. Males

The process whereby sperm are prepared to fertilize an egg, which is known as _capacitation_ , takes place in two stages.

Along with the vessels of the conjunctiva (which is a thin layer covering the sclera), those in the episclera render the inflamed eye bright red. The external layer of the eyeball is composed of the sclera, which is the opaque tissue making up the "white" of the eye, and the transparent cornea located on the front of the eye. The sclera provides structural support and protection to the eyeball, while the cornea helps focus incoming light onto the retina. It contains many blood vessels that supply nutrients to the retina. The ciliary body connects the choroid with the iris and plays a role in secreting aqueous humor, which helps maintain the shape of the eye. The innermost layer of the eyeball is the retina. The retina also contains blood vessels and plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information to the optic nerve. The wall of the eyeball is composed of three concentric layers. The cornea covers the front portion of the eye and is continuous with the sclera, which forms the majority of the white of the eye. Moving inward, the middle layer is called the vascular coat or uvea. It consists of the choroid, which is a highly vascular layer providing nutrients to the retina. The choroid has a dark brown color due to the presence of blood vessels and melanin pigment.

The cornea is transparent and located at the front of the eye. The sclera, which is dull white in color, protects the internal structures of the eye and maintains the eye's shape. The uvea is a vascular pigmented layer that is attached to the sclera. It consists of three parts: the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. The retina is the innermost layer of the eyeball. The vascular layer of the eyeball, also known as the uvea, is composed of three parts: the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris. It is a thin, highly vascularized, and pigmented layer that lies between the retina and the sclera. The choroid supplies blood to the retina and helps nourish its cells with oxygen and nutrients. Lastly, there is the iris, which is the most anterior portion of the vascular layer. It is a thin, circular structure that determines the color of the eye. The iris contains muscles that regulate the size of the pupil, controlling the amount of light that enters the eye. The iris also helps in protecting the internal structures of the eye. Overall, the components of the vascular layer of the eyeball work together to provide nourishment to the retina, regulate the amount of light entering the eye, facilitate accommodation for near vision, and maintain intraocular pressure. Vascular layer of the eyeball\n\nThe vascular layer of the eyeball consists of three continuous parts—the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris from posterior to anterior (Fig. It is a thin, highly vascular, pigmented layer consisting of smaller vessels adjacent to the retina and larger vessels more peripherally. Extending from the anterior border of the choroid is the ciliary body (Fig. Its components include the ciliary muscle and the ciliary processes."

Primary and secondary markings on metal bullets serve as important identifiers for weapons. These markings, also known as "tool marks," are created during the manufacturing process and can provide valuable information for forensic investigations and crime scene analysis. Primary markings are intentional, distinctive characteristics that are intentionally engraved or stamped onto a bullet during the manufacturing process. These markings can include the manufacturer's logo, brand name, or specific design features unique to a particular manufacturer. Primary markings help identify the firearm that fired the bullet and can narrow down the list of possible weapons used in a crime. These markings can include scratches, pits, or imperfections caused by the firearm's chamber, breech face, or extractor. By analyzing primary and secondary markings on a bullet, forensic experts can determine important information such as the make and model of the firearm used, its potential history, and potentially link it to a specific crime. Overall, primary and secondary markings on metal bullets play a crucial role in the identification of weapons, aiding in criminal investigations, and supporting the justice system. These markings, often referred to as toolmarks or striations, are unique patterns that are left on the bullet as it passes through the gun barrel. This process, known as bullet matching or ballistics comparison, involves examining the striations, scratches, and grooves on the bullet's surface. Primary markings are the initial impressions left by the gun barrel, such as the rifling pattern and the number of lands and grooves. Secondary markings, on the other hand, are the additional imperfections that occur during the manufacturing process or due to wear and tear in the gun barrel. By examining and matching the primary and secondary markings on a metal bullet, investigators can potentially link the bullet to a specific firearm. It is important to note that while bullet matching is valuable in forensic investigations, it is not a foolproof method. These markings, often referred to as toolmarks or striations, are unique patterns that are left on the bullet as it passes through the gun barrel.

Spain consolidated their top spot by winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the Netherlands jumping above Germany by finishing second in the tournament. In the 2013 rankings, Spain maintained top spot by winning their third major competition in a row - UEFA Euro 2012. Germany regained second, with the Dutch falling back to third place after failing to make it out of their group. Germany climbed to the top of the 2015 rankings as a result of their 2014 FIFA World Cup success; Spain dropped behind them. England reached their highest position in the rankings - placed third. Germany held on to top spot in 2017, with new European champions Portugal in second; Belgium were third. Highest FIFA ranking: 1st (November 2015 – March 2016, September 2018 – present) ; Lowest FIFA ranking: 71st (June 2007) ; Best Mover: +25 (April 2011) ; Worst Mover: −14 (September 2010) Source: FIFA.com 

40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage. Results against the teams that finished fourth in their group were discounted. In order to preserve chronological evolvements, any postponed matches are not included to the round at which they were originally scheduled, but added to the full round they were played immediately afterwards. The top three teams in each group also qualified for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings. According to Soccer United Marketing, Brazil (Group B) and Mexico (Group C) were seeded as they were "the most decorated nations in the last 100 years in international competitions from their respective confederations".

From Viking times, duvets of eider down were used by people on the northern coast of Norway. From the 16th century, wealthy people all over Europe began buying and using such duvets. In the 17th century, Paul Rycaut was among the first to try and market the duvet in England. In the story The Princess and the Pea, published in 1835, H.C. Andersen wrote about a princess lying on 10 eiderdown duvets. In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, an Englishman on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise: "There is one thing very particular to them, that they do not cover themselves with bed-clothes, but lay one feather-bed over, and another under. This is comfortable enough in winter, but how they can bear their feather-beds over them in summer, as is generally practised, I cannot conceive." Bed-sharing is standard practice in many parts of the world outside of North America, Europe and Australia, and even in the latter areas a significant minority of children have shared a bed with their parents at some point in childhood. One 2006 study of children age 3–10 in India reported 93% of children bed-sharing while a 2006 study of children in Kentucky in the United States reported 15% of infants and toddlers 2 weeks to 2 years engage in bed-sharing. Bed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the crib. In many parts of the world, bed-sharing simply has the practical benefit of keeping the child warm at night.

As such, rooming house residents tended to have only one or two bags or a single trunk of possessions. Another change between the 19th century and the turn of the 20th century was the separation of rooming houses according to religion (Catholic, Protestant), ethnic origin (Irish) or occupation (mechanics, cooks); while this was common in the 19th century, it became less common in the early 20th 

 The state bed, intended for receiving important visitors and producing heirs before a select public, but not intended for sleeping in, evolved during the second half of the seventeenth century, developing the medieval tradition of receiving visitors in the bedroom, which had become the last and most private room of the standard suite of rooms in a Baroque apartment. Louis XIV developed the rituals of receptions in his state bedchamber, the petit lever to which only a handful of his court élite might expect to be invited.

A specific underlying back condition can be an important factor that influences preference for mattress types and sleep positions. Alternatively, sleeping in a reclining chair or an adjustable bed elevates the head and knees, and so relieves pressure on the facet joints. With this condition, it may be preferable to sleep on the sides with the knees curled up (in the fetal position). A condition such as inflammation of the bursa over the hips (greater trochanteric bursitis) can be aggravated by pressure from a mattress that is too firm. If the mattress is too firm, a new mattress with thick padding on top—also called a pillow-top mattress—can reduce pressure on the hip. As a less expensive alternative, covering an older mattress with a new pillow-top can provide additional cushioning. The preferred sleep position depends in part on the position of the disc.

It was not until the 1960's that these devices became popular for the general consumer, and since the price has dropped while the quality has risen. There are many medicinal advantages that are associated with adjustable beds. Adjustable beds have been shown to improve circulation, help to ease lower back pain and tension, improve breathing conditions, help with acid reflux, and have many other benefits. Of all the medical benefits associated with adjustable beds, perhaps the most intriguing is its help with combating acid reflux. This is where the advantage of owning an adjustable bed comes in. Adjustable beds offer many other advantages that revolve around individual comfort and usability. They make it much easier to watch TV or to read books in bed. It is also much more ergonomic and practical to eat in bed with an adjustable bed.

 Genetics and the Origin of Species is a 1937 book by the Ukrainian-American evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. After years of development, he finally published his evidence and theory in On the Origin of Species in 1859. One hundred years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor. His work also had a significant impact on ecology. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858.

 The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history." Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection, though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. "On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection" is the title of a journal article, comprising and resulting from the joint presentation of two scientific papers to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858: On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type by Alfred Russel Wallace and an Extract from an unpublished Work on Species from Charles Darwin's Essay of 1844.

"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection" is the title of a journal article, comprising and resulting from the joint presentation of two scientific papers to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858: On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type by Alfred Russel Wallace and an Extract from an unpublished Work on Species from Charles Darwin's Essay of 1844. This was published in November 1859 as On the Origin of Species.

If a sound impulse originates from a point equidistant to each ear (e.g. directly behind or in front of the head), the neuronal impulses from each ear will pass at a 

 Listening may be considered as a simple and isolated process, but it would be far more precise to perceive it as a complex and systematic process. It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion. According to Barthes, listening can be understood on three levels: alerting, deciphering, and understanding how the sound is produced and how it affects the listener. This means that certain places have certain sounds associated with them; for 

 any given home. An intrusion, a sound that is not familiar (e.g. a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window) alerts whoever lives there to potential danger. In this scenario the child is waiting to pick up on sound cues (e.g. jingling keys, the turn of the doorknob, etc.) that signal his mother's approach. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. What is loss of loudness vs. loss of clarity? Sound waves travel down the ear canal and hit the eardrum. The vibrations are transferred into one of two parts of the inner ear, the Cochlea. The vibrations move microscopic, finely tuned sensory cells which send impulses to the brain where sound is interpreted. Sensorineural - A sensorineural hearing loss is a problem in the inner ear. It is permanent and can vary from mild to profound. We use the terms mild, moderate, severe and profound to describe the varying degrees of hearing loss. None of the speech sounds are audible for a person with a severe hearing loss and they may require people to shout to

 The Forest Grove Sound was an unexplained noise, described by The Oregonian as a "mechanical scream", heard in Forest Grove, Oregon in February 2016. In February 2016, a high pitched noise was heard at night in Forest Grove, Oregon. The Department of Forestry determined that their equipment was not the cause of the sound.

 Many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition, or more commonly known as psychoacoustics, in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects. The information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain, emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics. In a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics, it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music. By observing how the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spine, is influenced by acoustics, the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind, and essentially the body, is evident.

 Listening may be considered as a simple and isolated process, but it would be far more precise to perceive it as a complex and systematic process. It involves the perception of sounds made by the speaker, of intonation patterns that focus on the information, and of the relevance of the topic under discussion. According to Barthes, listening can be understood on three levels: alerting, deciphering, and understanding how the sound is produced and how it affects the listener. This means that certain places have certain sounds associated with them; for 

 any given home. An intrusion, a sound that is not familiar (e.g. a squeaking door or floorboard, a breaking window) alerts whoever lives there to potential danger. In this scenario the child is waiting to pick up on sound cues (e.g. jingling keys, the turn of the doorknob, etc.) that signal his mother's approach. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the threshold of hearing, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. What is loss of loudness vs. loss of clarity? Sound waves travel down the ear canal and hit the eardrum. The vibrations are transferred into one of two parts of the inner ear, the Cochlea. The vibrations move microscopic, finely tuned sensory cells which send impulses to the brain where sound is interpreted. Sensorineural - A sensorineural hearing loss is a problem in the inner ear. It is permanent and can vary from mild to profound. We use the terms mild, moderate, severe and profound to describe the varying degrees of hearing loss. None of the speech sounds are audible for a person with a severe hearing loss and they may require people to shout to

According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. This triggers a multiplier effect which draws the economy toward underemployment equilibrium. By the same token, strong demand results in unplanned reduction of inventories, which tends to increase production, employment, and incomes. If entrepreneurs consider such trends sustainable, investments typically increase, thereby improving potential levels of production. In the 1960s, Robert Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud did further work on effective demand, and in the 1970s Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman published a well-known model of spillover effects upon effective demand. Classical economist David Ricardo embraced Say's Law, suggesting, in Keynes's formulation, that "supply creates its own demand". According to Say's Law, for every excess supply (glut) of goods in one market, there is a corresponding excess demand (shortage) in another. This theory suggests that a general glut can never be accompanied by inadequate demand for products on a macroeconomic level. In challenge of Say's Law, Thomas Malthus, Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi and other 19th century economists argued that "effective demand" is the foundation of a stable economy. Responding to the Great Depression of the 20th century, in the 1930s Michał Kalecki and John Maynard Keynes concurred with the latter theory, suggesting that 

 The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The theory views business cycles as the consequence of excessive growth in bank credit due to artificially low interest rates set by a central bank or fractional reserve banks. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. Proponents believe that a sustained period of low interest rates and excessive credit creation from fractional reserve banks result in a volatile and unstable imbalance between saving and investment. This includes investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and technology, among others. Factor price equalization is an economic theory, by Paul A. Samuelson (1948), which states that the prices of identical factors of production, such as the wage rate or the rent of capital, will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in commodities. Other key assumptions of the theorem are that each country faces the same commodity prices, because of free trade in commodities, uses the same technology for production, and produces both goods. A simple summary of this theory is when the prices of the output 

 In the US, the budget deficit is financed about half from foreigners, half domestically. Therefore, with an additional $400 billion deficit, the trade deficit would, according to the theory, be increased by some $200 billion. In effect, the economy is borrowing from foreigners in exchange for foreign-made goods. Traditional macroeconomics predicts that persistent double deficits will lead to currency devaluation/depreciation that can be severe and sudden. In the case of the United States, the twin deficit graph as a percentage of GDP 

 The Austrian theory of the business cycle (ABCT) focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who posited that fractional reserve banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes which leads to an artificial "boom". Mises stated that this artificial "boom" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called "malinvestment" - which eventually must end in a "bust". Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment 

 weak, and through these loans money supply increases. However, inflation remains low because of either a pegged exchange rate or a supply shock, and thus the central bank does not tighten credit and money. Increasingly speculative loans are made as diminishing returns lead to reduced yields. Eventually inflation begins or the economy slows, and when asset prices decline, a bubble is pricked which encourages a macroeconomic bust. In 2006, William White argued that "financial liberalization has increased the likelihood of boom-bust cycles of the Austrian sort" and he has later argued the "near complete dominance of Keynesian economics in the

According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. This triggers a multiplier effect which draws the economy toward underemployment equilibrium. By the same token, strong demand results in unplanned reduction of inventories, which tends to increase production, employment, and incomes. If entrepreneurs consider such trends sustainable, investments typically increase, thereby improving potential levels of production. In the 1960s, Robert Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud did further work on effective demand, and in the 1970s Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman published a well-known model of spillover effects upon effective demand. Classical economist David Ricardo embraced Say's Law, suggesting, in Keynes's formulation, that "supply creates its own demand". According to Say's Law, for every excess supply (glut) of goods in one market, there is a corresponding excess demand (shortage) in another. This theory suggests that a general glut can never be accompanied by inadequate demand for products on a macroeconomic level. In challenge of Say's Law, Thomas Malthus, Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi and other 19th century economists argued that "effective demand" is the foundation of a stable economy. Responding to the Great Depression of the 20th century, in the 1930s Michał Kalecki and John Maynard Keynes concurred with the latter theory, suggesting that 

 The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The theory views business cycles as the consequence of excessive growth in bank credit due to artificially low interest rates set by a central bank or fractional reserve banks. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory. Proponents believe that a sustained period of low interest rates and excessive credit creation from fractional reserve banks result in a volatile and unstable imbalance between saving and investment. This includes investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and technology, among others. Factor price equalization is an economic theory, by Paul A. Samuelson (1948), which states that the prices of identical factors of production, such as the wage rate or the rent of capital, will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in commodities. Other key assumptions of the theorem are that each country faces the same commodity prices, because of free trade in commodities, uses the same technology for production, and produces both goods. A simple summary of this theory is when the prices of the output 

 In the US, the budget deficit is financed about half from foreigners, half domestically. Therefore, with an additional $400 billion deficit, the trade deficit would, according to the theory, be increased by some $200 billion. In effect, the economy is borrowing from foreigners in exchange for foreign-made goods. Traditional macroeconomics predicts that persistent double deficits will lead to currency devaluation/depreciation that can be severe and sudden. In the case of the United States, the twin deficit graph as a percentage of GDP 

 The Austrian theory of the business cycle (ABCT) focuses on banks' issuance of credit as the cause of economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who posited that fractional reserve banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes which leads to an artificial "boom". Mises stated that this artificial "boom" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called "malinvestment" - which eventually must end in a "bust". Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment 

 weak, and through these loans money supply increases. However, inflation remains low because of either a pegged exchange rate or a supply shock, and thus the central bank does not tighten credit and money. Increasingly speculative loans are made as diminishing returns lead to reduced yields. Eventually inflation begins or the economy slows, and when asset prices decline, a bubble is pricked which encourages a macroeconomic bust. In 2006, William White argued that "financial liberalization has increased the likelihood of boom-bust cycles of the Austrian sort" and he has later argued the "near complete dominance of Keynesian economics in the

Repeated injections, especially with blunt needles. ; Poor injection technique. ; Injection of substances which irritate the veins; in particular, injection of liquid methadone intended for oral use. Removing the needle too quickly after injecting can have a similar effect. What Is a Subcutaneous Injection? A subcutaneous injection is a method of administering medication. Subcutaneous means under the skin. In this type of injection, a short needle is used to inject a drug into the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. This type of injection is used when other methods of administration might be less effective. Other methods, like intravenous injection, can be difficult and costly. For small amounts of delicate drugs, a subcutaneous injection can be a useful, safe, and convenient method of getting a medication into your body. Medications administered by subcutaneous injection include drugs that can be given in small volumes (usually less than 1 mL but up to 2 mL is safe). Insulin and some hormones are commonly administered as subcutaneous injections. Other drugs that need to be given very quickly can also be administered via subcutaneous injection. While it’s intended to be given intramuscularly, epinephrine will also work if given subcutaneously. Some vaccines and allergy shots are administered as a subcutaneous injection. The location of injection is important for subcutaneous injections. The drug needs to be injected into the fatty tissue just below the skin. Some areas of the body have a more easily accessible layer of tissue, where a needle injected under the skin will not hit muscle, bone, or blood vessels. Clean and inspect the injection site. Before injecting medication, inspect your skin to make sure there’s no bruising, burns, swelling, hardness,

A subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ, or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses A subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications Medications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Insulin Perhaps the most common medication administered subcutaneously is insulin. Contraindications Contraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. Medications which may cause necrosis

Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less 

 Intestinal villi (singular: villus) are small, finger-like projections that extend into the lumen of the small intestine. Each villus is approximately 0.5–1.6 mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border. An increased absorptive area is useful because digested nutrients (including monosaccharide and amino acids) pass into the semipermeable villi through diffusion, which is effective only at short distances. There are also enzymes (enterocyte digestive enzyme) on the surface for digestion. They have a large surface area so there will be more efficient absorption of fatty acids and glycerol into the blood stream. The hepatopancreas feeds into the midgut, where digestive enzymes are released, and nutrients taken up. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus. The digestion and absorption process in the gastrointestinal tract involves several steps. Saliva also contains the enzyme salivary amylase, which begins the chemical digestion of cooked starch. This movement is facilitated by peristalsis, which involves muscle contractions to propel the food throughout the GI tract. Here, further digestion takes place with the help of pancreatic enzymes, bile from the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine itself. These enzymes break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The small intestine is where most absorption occurs. The inner lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine and transported to various organs and tissues for energy and other functions. In summary, digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract involve the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, followed by the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine and elimination of waste in the large intestine. The human body breaks down and absorbs food through a series of processes. When food is ingested, it enters the digestive system where it is broken down into simpler particles through the process of digestion. The partially digested food, known as the bolus, then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach. From the stomach, the chyme moves into the small intestine. It is responsible for breaking down food into its simplest forms, such as sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The lining of the small intestine contains tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. The nutrients are then transported through the bloodstream to various cells and tissues in the body for energy production and other functions. It is important to note that the absorption of digested food material occurs primarily in the small intestine, whereas the large intestine is involved in water reabsorption. The structures and organs involved in the digestive process, such as the stomach, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, each have specific roles in breaking down and absorbing food. Overall, the human body's ability to break down and absorb food is a complex process involving various organs, enzymes, and physiological mechanisms to ensure the body receives the necessary nutrients for optimal function. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose.

Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). Ossification (or osteogenesis) in bone remodeling is the process of laying down new bone material by cells named osteoblasts. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, healthy bone tissue: Intramembranous ossification is the direct laying down of bone into the primitive connective tissue (mesenchyme), while endochondral ossification involves cartilage as a precursor. It is a process that occurs during ossification, but not necessarily vice versa. The exact mechanisms by which bone development is triggered remains unclear, but growth factors and cytokines appear to play a role. In the fetus, the formation of the calvaria involves a process known as intramembranous ossification. (1990) distinguish three cell types from osteoblast to mature osteocyte: type I preosteocyte (osteoblastic osteocyte), type II preosteocyte (osteoid osteocyte), and type III preosteocyte (partially surrounded by mineral matrix).

Endochondral ossification is one of the two essential processes during fetal development of the mammalian skeletal system by which bone tissue is created. Unlike intramembranous ossification, which is the other process by which bone tissue is created, cartilage is present during endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is also an essential process during the rudimentary formation of long bones, the growth of the length of long bones, and the natural healing of bone fractures. This is called interstitial growth. Primary center of ossification The first site of ossification occurs in the primary center of ossification, which is in the middle of diaphysis (shaft).

 Intramembranous ossification forms the flat bones of the skull, mandible and hip bone. During bone formation, an osteoblast is left behind and buried in the bone matrix as an "osteoid osteocyte", which maintains contact with other osteoblasts through extended cellular processes. The process of osteocytogenesis is largely unknown, but the following molecules have been shown to play a crucial role in the production of healthy osteocytes, either in correct numbers or specific distributions: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1), osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 (OF45), Klotho, TGF-beta inducible factor (TIEG), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), E11 antigen,

Secondary center of ossification About the time of birth in mammals, a secondary ossification center appears in each end (epiphysis) of long bones. Periosteal buds carry mesenchyme and blood vessels in and the process is similar to that occurring in a primary ossification center. Growth continues until the individual is about 20 years old or until the cartilage in the plate is replaced by bone. Histology During endochondral ossification, five distinct zones can be seen at the light-microscope level. Recently it has been shown

 Intramembranous ossification forms the flat bones of the skull, mandible and hip bone. During bone formation, an osteoblast is left behind and buried in the bone matrix as an "osteoid osteocyte", which maintains contact with other osteoblasts through extended cellular processes. The process of osteocytogenesis is largely unknown, but the following molecules have been shown to play a crucial role in the production of healthy osteocytes, either in correct numbers or specific distributions: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1), osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 (OF45), Klotho, TGF-beta inducible factor (TIEG), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), E11 antigen,

Much of the state's acreage is planted to varieties like Concord and Niagara, destined for juice production. Wine grapes represent 11% of total vineyard area. An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is a designated appellation for American wine in the United States distinguishable by geographic, geologic, and climatic features, with boundaries defined by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the United States Department of the Treasury. Over half (142) of the AVAs are in California. American Viticultural Areas range in size from the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA at 29900 sqmi across four states, to the Cole Ranch AVA in Mendocino County, California, at only 62 acre. Michigan is one of the foremost U.S. states in the production of diverse varieties of bottled, fermented fruit wine. Michigan is the leading state for tart cherry production (many Traverse City vineyards were formerly cherry orchards); a number of Michigan wineries produce cherry wine, spice cherry wine, and cherry-grape blends. York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes, just behind California and Washington. It has AVA's near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island, and in the Hudson Valley has the second-most productive area in the country for growing apples, making it a center for hard cider production, just like New England. With a total area of 230000 acre, 38000 acre of which are planted to wine grapes, this region in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley region of the Central Valley produces 10% of all wine grapes grown in the state of California. The region has seen tremendous growth and success due to the shift from high-volume production to high-quality production. Michigan wine refers to any wine that is made in the state of Michigan in the United States. As of 2018, there were 3050 acre under wine-grape cultivation and 148 commercial wineries in Michigan, producing 3 e6USgal of wine. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007. Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA. There are also a few disjunct wineries in every region of the state, including some in the Upper Peninsula that have opened over the past several years. Unionville Vineyards specializes in the use of Burgundy, Rhône, and Alsatian grapes. Wine is produced from Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chambourcin, Counoise, Gewürztraminer, Marsanne, Mourvèdre, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Roussanne, Syrah, and Viognier grapes. It is the only winery in New Jersey that grows and produces wine from Counoise, Marsanne, and Roussanne – vinifera grapes indigenous to the Rhone river valley of France. At the 2010 International Wine and Spirit Competition, which included both blind tasting and laboratory analysis, Unionville's Chardonnay was the only wine from the United States to win a gold (best in class) medal.

The third season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones premiered in the United States on HBO on March 31, 2013, and concluded on June 9, 2013. The season is based roughly on the first half of A Storm of Swords (the third of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R. R. Martin, of which the series is an adaptation). However, Daenerys arrives with her dragons to rescue 

 "Winterfell" is the eighth season premiere episode of HBO's fantasy television series Game of Thrones, and the 68th overall. The episode centres on Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow arriving in Winterfell with Unsullied and Dothraki forces, after Jon Snow has pledged his allegiance to her. It also reunites Jon with his Stark siblings Bran and Arya for the first time since the first season's second episode. "Winterfell" received positive reception from critics, who listed Jon Snow and Daenerys's arrival at Winterfell, Jon's long-awaited reunion with Arya, the destruction of Last Hearth, Sam's revelation to Jon Snow about his true lineage, Jaime and Bran's tense encounter, and the performances of Sophie Turner and John Bradley as highlights of the episode. Ramsay Bolton seizes Winterfell and the North for himself; Tyrion Lannister unchains the dragons being held in the catacombs of Meereen; Arya Stark proceeds to the next step in her training; and Bran Stark sees the past.

For example, this 2-uniform hypergraph represents a graph with 4 vertices {1,2,3,4} and 3 edges: By the above definition, a matching in a graph is a set M of edges, such that each two edges in M have an empty intersection. This is equivalent to saying that no two edges in M are adjacent to the same vertex; this is exactly the definition of a matching in a graph. The comparability graph of a partial order is the undirected graph with a vertex for each element and an undirected edge for each pair of distinct elements x, y with either 

 A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. Additionally, every n-vertex strongly connected directed graph in which each vertex has degree at least n (counting incoming and outgoing edges together) is either pancyclic or it is a complete bipartite directed graph. In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a bouquet. That is, it is formed from a minimal vertex series parallel graph by forgetting the orientation of each edge. The comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order is a cograph: the series and parallel composition operations of the partial order give rise to operations on the comparability graph that form the disjoint union of two subgraphs or that connect two subgraphs by all possible edges; these two operations are the basic operations from which cographs are defined. Conversely, every cograph is the comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order. If a partial order has a cograph as its comparability graph, then it must be a series-parallel partial order, because every other kind of partial order has an N suborder that would correspond to an induced four-vertex path in its comparability graph, and such paths are forbidden in cographs. t and s are both endpoints of an edge of K, and if t is an edge in this cycle, it and s are both faces of a triangle of K. This cycle is homeomorphic to a circle, which is a 1-dimensional sphere. For manifolds of dimension at most 4, any triangulation of a manifold is a piecewise linear triangulation: In any simplicial complex homeomorphic to a manifold, the link of any simplex can only be homeomorphic to a sphere. the same number of vertices (i.e. A graph is simple if it has no self-loops and no multiple edges with the same endpoints.

The comparability graph of a partial order is the undirected graph with a vertex for each element and an undirected edge for each pair of distinct elements x, y with either 

 A planar embedding of a given graph is a drawing of the graph in the Euclidean plane, with points for its vertices and curves for its edges, in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. Additionally, every n-vertex strongly connected directed graph in which each vertex has degree at least n (counting incoming and outgoing edges together) is either pancyclic or it is a complete bipartite directed graph. In graph theory, a loop (also called a self-loop or a buckle) is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. Depending on the context, a graph or a multigraph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of loops (often in concert with allowing or disallowing multiple edges between the same vertices): In a graph with one vertex, all edges must be loops. Such a graph is called a bouquet. That is, it is formed from a minimal vertex series parallel graph by forgetting the orientation of each edge. The comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order is a cograph: the series and parallel composition operations of the partial order give rise to operations on the comparability graph that form the disjoint union of two subgraphs or that connect two subgraphs by all possible edges; these two operations are the basic operations from which cographs are defined. Conversely, every cograph is the comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order. If a partial order has a cograph as its comparability graph, then it must be a series-parallel partial order, because every other kind of partial order has an N suborder that would correspond to an induced four-vertex path in its comparability graph, and such paths are forbidden in cographs. t and s are both endpoints of an edge of K, and if t is an edge in this cycle, it and s are both faces of a triangle of K. This cycle is homeomorphic to a circle, which is a 1-dimensional sphere. For manifolds of dimension at most 4, any triangulation of a manifold is a piecewise linear triangulation: In any simplicial complex homeomorphic to a manifold, the link of any simplex can only be homeomorphic to a sphere. the same number of vertices (i.e. A graph is simple if it has no self-loops and no multiple edges with the same endpoints. The number of maximal directed pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge.

 My Fabulous Gay Wedding is a Canadian reality show hosted by comedian Scott Thompson in the first season and Elvira Kurt in the second. The series airs on the Global Television Network. It is re-broadcast in the U.S. as First Comes Love, on Logo. In the first season, the show features a same-sex couple that plans to marry; the arrangements for the wedding are prepared, on two weeks' notice, by a team of wedding planners who are both heterosexual and homosexual. As with typical, Western heterosexual weddings, the general idea is to create a unique experience that reflects the personality of the people to be wed, while adding a special gay sensibility. In the second season, with new host Elvira Kurt, the stories concentrate more on the couples than the wedding planning process. The team of wedding planners has been reduced to one: Fern Cohen. This season debuted on Logo in February 2007. Through interviews with the family members, the show also explores the issue of same-sex marriage and its effect on the social fabric. Abby Holland and Harper Caldwell are a couple who have been dating nearly a year. Abby has disliked Christmas since her parents died, so Harper spontaneously invites Abby to celebrate the holidays with her family in her hometown. Abby sees this as the perfect opportunity to introduce herself to Harper's parents and propose to her on Christmas morning. However, on their way to the Caldwells' house, Harper reveals she lied to Abby about coming out to her parents previously; fearing doing so would interfere with her father's campaign for mayor, she doesn't want to come out to her family until after Christmas.

There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. In some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction, a magistrate, or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers. The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a trial de novo before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered. A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages. They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause, act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, administer oaths of office to public officials, take depositions and issue subpoenas. New Hampshire justices of the peace are also authorized, upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit, to issue arrest warrants, search warrants, administrative inspection warrants and by court appointment, to fix and receive bail in criminal cases. Their judicial powers were replaced by full-time, salaried, legally qualified district justices (now called district judges) and their quasi-judicial powers by unpaid lay peace commissioners. A commissioner for oaths can perform every function a peace commissioner can, plus more. In the state of Queensland, a "justice of the peace (qualified)" has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and, in conjunction with another justice of the peace (qualified) constitute a magistrates' court for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings. Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates' court), usually in remote Aboriginal communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate. In Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate's Court).

Between the two of them, father and son Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola won four awards, with Carmine winning for Best Original Dramatic Score (with Nino Rota) and Francis for Picture, Director, and Best Screenplay Adapted from Other Material (with Mario Puzo). The 54th Academy Awards were presented March 29, 1982, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The ceremonies were presided over by Johnny Carson. This also marked the first year that the award for Best Makeup was presented. This was the last year until the 2005 Oscars where all five Best Picture nominations were also nominated for Best Director.

 O'Donnell started training in 1968 and first came to prominence in the late 1970s with 'Malange', reaching the 1978 St Leger final at Wembley and winning the 1978 Irish St Leger at Limerick. O'Donnell successfully defended the title in 1991 with Ardfert Mick and joined the exclusive group of English/Irish Derby winning trainers with Farloe Melody in 1992. After retiring from training he assisted his wife Frances, who took over the licence; in 2012 she won the Irish Derby.

 Prior to the Cup, Viewed won the AJC Listed Japan Racing Association (JRA) Plate on 30 April 2008 and two months later he qualified by winning the Group 2 Brisbane Cup on 9 June 2008. In the 2008 Melbourne Cup on 4 November, Viewed defeated the Luca Cumani-trained Bauer in a photo finish. It was Shinn's first Melbourne Cup winner and the 12th for Cummings. It was the fourth time Cummings had won the Cup in partnership with Dato Tan Chin Nam, the owner. Viewed's Melbourne Cup was the 250th Group 1 training victory for Bart Cummings. Viewed was an outsider in the Melbourne Cup, and paid $41.00 on the totalisator in New South Wales. The popular Bart Cummings trained mare Leilani was the favourite for the 1974 Melbourne Cup but she was run down in the last fifty metres by her stablemate Think Big under jockey Harry White. Following his second last in the lead up MacKinnon Stakes, Think Big started at 33–1 in the 1975 Melbourne Cup, assigned high-weight of 58 kg. But at his favourite course and distance, again under jockey Harry White, he fought off a challenge from stablemate Holiday Waggon to record his second win. After winning the 1965 Caulfield Cup, many thought he stood a good chance in the Melbourne Cup of that year (won by Light Fingers, trained by Bart Cummings). The race won by Light Fingers, trained by Bart Cummings who won the first of what would end up being a record 12 Melbourne Cups.

The Defendant in Diaz sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court. While 

 Dollree Mapp (October 30, 1923 – October 31, 2014) was the appellant in the Supreme Court case Mapp v. Ohio (1961). She argued that her right to privacy in her home, the Fourth Amendment, was violated by police officers who entered her house with what she thought to be a fake search warrant. Mapp also argued that the Exclusionary Rule was violated due to the collection of the evidence that was found after the police had entered her house without a convincing search warrant according to Mapp's experience. In the Supreme Court case, Mapp v. Ohio, the decision was made in favor of Mapp, in a 6-3 ruling. As a result of the ruling in Mapp v. Ohio, Mapp's conviction was voided. A few years after Mapp v. Ohio was ruled upon, Mapp was convicted again, but this time for the possession of narcotics. Early efforts at police reform often involved external commissions, such as the Wickersham Commission, that spelled out reforms but left to the police to implement them, often with limited success. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions under the Warren Court led to important changes in policing, with respect to civil rights and constitutional law. Mapp v. Ohio in 1961 and Miranda v. Arizona in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions. Mapp v. Ohio found that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures" may not be used in criminal prosecutions.

The officer found evidence of pornography in Mapp's house. As a result, Mapp was "charged under an Ohio law that made possession of obscene material a felony." Mapp was sentenced with 7 years in prison. However, when the argument was altered to focus on the Fourth Amendment by Justice Clark, only 5 justices decided that the evidence taken from Mapp's home, without a search warrant, was "illegally obtained." As a result of the Mapp opinion, the Supreme Court extended the obtainment of illegal evidence rule to the states.

 Artigas Department (Departamento de Artigas, ) is the northernmost department of Uruguay, located in its northwestern region. Its capital is the city of Artigas, which borders on the Brazilian city of Quaraí. It is bordered on the north and east by Brazil, from which it is separated by the Cuareim River. The department and its capital city are named after José Gervasio Artigas (1764–1850), leader of the Orientales (inhabitants of the Banda Oriental, the Eastern bank of the Uruguay River) during Uruguay's wars of independence. The city is located near national route 14, a route growing in importance because it connects Argentina's capital Buenos Aires and São Paulo in Brazil, the biggest city of South America, being one of the most important routes in Mercosur.

[2024-06-14 14:53:47,890] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: The 2020 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 2020 season. It was the 116th edition of the World Series, a best-of-seven-playoff between the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers defeated the Rays to win the series in six games for their first championship since 1988. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, from October 20 to October 27 with the ballpark's seating capacity limited to 25 percent (11,500 fans). In a rematch of 2019, the Rays defeated the Astros in the seven-game ALCS, and went on to meet the Dodgers in the World Series. The Rays won Game 4 of the series in near-miraculous fashion; down 6-7, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down in the count 1–2, Brett Phillips singled off LA closer Kenley Jansen for his first career postseason hit, scoring Kiermaier to tie the game, and Arozarena to score the winning run and tie the series at two. Despite the heroics, the Rays lost the next two games to the Dodgers and were defeated in their second bid for a World Series. Following their series loss, Tampa Bay placed Blake Snell on the trade block and later sent him to the San Diego Padres for a major-league catcher and three minor-league prospects. It was played at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, on October 1, 2007. The Rockies won the game 9–8 in thirteen innings on a controversial play at home plate. The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game. After advancing, they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics. The Rays held on to even the series with a 6–4 win. The Dodgers struck out 15 times in the game, tying the World Series franchise record set in the 18-inning third game of the 2018 World Series. Those were the first baseball games played at the Alamodome. He worked all 4 games on June 13–16, 2019, between the San Diego Padres and the Colorado Rockies in which both teams set a Major League Record for combined runs in a four-game series (92). Barrett worked his first career MLB postseason game in left field on October 2, 2019, serving in the 2019 American League Wild Card Game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Oakland Athletics. In the NLCS, the NL East champion Chicago Cubs – making their first postseason appearance since 1945 – won Games 1 and 2, but Williams' Padres took the next three games in a miraculous comeback to win the pennant. In the World Series, however, San Diego was no match for Sparky Anderson's Detroit Tigers, a team that had won 104 games during the regular season. Cash defended his decision, stating he did not want Snell going through the Dodgers order a third time, even despite his dominance for 5 1⁄3 innings. Yahoo Sports immediately named it one of the worst decisions in World Series history, while Deadspin called it the third worst in World Series history. FOX Sports post-game analyst and former big leaguer Alex Rodriguez said it was the worst decision he had ever seen in baseball.

2024-06-14 14:53:47 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: The 2020 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 2020 season. It was the 116th edition of the World Series, a best-of-seven-playoff between the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers defeated the Rays to win the series in six games for their first championship since 1988. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, from October 20 to October 27 with the ballpark's seating capacity limited to 25 percent (11,500 fans). In a rematch of 2019, the Rays defeated the Astros in the seven-game ALCS, and went on to meet the Dodgers in the World Series. The Rays won Game 4 of the series in near-miraculous fashion; down 6-7, with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down in the count 1–2, Brett Phillips singled off LA closer Kenley Jansen for his first career postseason hit, scoring Kiermaier to tie the game, and Arozarena to score the winning run and tie the series at two. Despite the heroics, the Rays lost the next two games to the Dodgers and were defeated in their second bid for a World Series. Following their series loss, Tampa Bay placed Blake Snell on the trade block and later sent him to the San Diego Padres for a major-league catcher and three minor-league prospects. It was played at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, on October 1, 2007. The Rockies won the game 9–8 in thirteen innings on a controversial play at home plate. The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game. After advancing, they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics. The Rays held on to even the series with a 6–4 win. The Dodgers struck out 15 times in the game, tying the World Series franchise record set in the 18-inning third game of the 2018 World Series. Those were the first baseball games played at the Alamodome. He worked all 4 games on June 13–16, 2019, between the San Diego Padres and the Colorado Rockies in which both teams set a Major League Record for combined runs in a four-game series (92). Barrett worked his first career MLB postseason game in left field on October 2, 2019, serving in the 2019 American League Wild Card Game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Oakland Athletics. In the NLCS, the NL East champion Chicago Cubs – making their first postseason appearance since 1945 – won Games 1 and 2, but Williams' Padres took the next three games in a miraculous comeback to win the pennant. In the World Series, however, San Diego was no match for Sparky Anderson's Detroit Tigers, a team that had won 104 games during the regular season. Cash defended his decision, stating he did not want Snell going through the Dodgers order a third time, even despite his dominance for 5 1⁄3 innings. Yahoo Sports immediately named it one of the worst decisions in World Series history, while Deadspin called it the third worst in World Series history. FOX Sports post-game analyst and former big leaguer Alex Rodriguez said it was the worst decision he had ever seen in baseball.

My Sister's Keeper (2004) is the eleventh novel by the American author Jodi Picoult. It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Anna was born as a savior sister specifically so she could save Kate's life through the donation of her umbilical cord blood. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her.

[2024-06-14 14:53:51,208] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. Returning to glycogen phosphorylase, the less active "b" form can itself be activated without the conformational change. This amplifies the effect of activating glycogen phosphorylase. Refer to glycolysis for further information of the regulation of glycogenesis. Allosteric inhibition refers to the process in which the activity of an enzyme is regulated by the binding of a molecule to a specific site other than the active site. When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required. By binding to specific allosteric sites on PFK-1, both citrate and ATP play crucial roles in regulating the enzyme's activity and maintaining metabolic balance. This classical example of allosteric inhibition demonstrates the intricate control mechanisms that exist in biochemistry to ensure efficient cellular function. An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway. PFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. On the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. In biochemistry, a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process is known as phosphorylation, where the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group to the substrate molecule. Conversely, it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group (producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP). These two processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during glycolysis. The phosphorylation state of a molecule, whether it be a protein, lipid or carbohydrate, can affect its activity, reactivity and its ability to bind other molecules. The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. When AMP or ADP levels are high, they bind to specific sites on PFK-1, inhibiting its activity and slowing down glycolysis.

Allosteric inhibition refers to the process in which the activity of an enzyme is regulated by the binding of a molecule to a specific site other than the active site. When the concentration of citrate increases, it indicates that there is an excess of metabolic intermediates upstream in the citric acid cycle. In response, citrate binds to a specific allosteric site on PFK-1, promoting allosteric inhibition. This inhibitory effect helps to prevent the accumulation of further metabolic intermediates and maintains metabolic homeostasis. When the cellular energy levels are high, ATP binds to an allosteric site on PFK-1, causing inhibition. This helps to prevent unnecessary glycolysis and ensures that energy is conserved when it is not required. By binding to specific allosteric sites on PFK-1, both citrate and ATP play crucial roles in regulating the enzyme's activity and maintaining metabolic balance. This classical example of allosteric inhibition demonstrates the intricate control mechanisms that exist in biochemistry to ensure efficient cellular function. An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. This enzymatic reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of glycolysis, meaning it is the slowest step and can regulate the overall speed of the pathway. PFK is an allosteric enzyme, meaning its activity can be modulated by the binding of specific molecules at sites other than its active site. On the other hand, ADP and AMP act as positive allosteric effectors that activate PFK. When energy levels in the cell are low, ADP and AMP levels increase, leading to the activation of PFK and, subsequently, an increased flux through the glycolytic pathway to generate more ATP. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. When the cellular levels of ATP are high, it inhibits phosphofructokinase, slowing down the rate of glycolysis. On the other hand, when ATP levels are low and the levels of ADP and AMP are high, they can bind to phosphofructokinase and relieve its inhibition, thus increasing the activity of the enzyme and promoting glycolysis. In biochemistry, a kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy, phosphate-donating molecules to specific substrates. This process is known as phosphorylation, where the high-energy ATP molecule donates a phosphate group to the substrate molecule. Conversely, it is referred to as dephosphorylation when the phosphorylated substrate donates a phosphate group and ADP gains a phosphate group (producing a dephosphorylated substrate and the high energy molecule of ATP). These two processes, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, occur four times during glycolysis. The phosphorylation state of a molecule, whether it be a protein, lipid or carbohydrate, can affect its activity, reactivity and its ability to bind other molecules. The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. When AMP or ADP levels are high, they bind to specific sites on PFK-1, inhibiting its activity and slowing down glycolysis.

The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the Era of Good Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president. In the 1830s, the Whig Party coalesced into the main rival to the Democrats. That party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans. Organizationally, the modern Democratic Party truly arose in the 1830s with the election of Andrew Jackson. Since the nomination of William Jennings Bryan in 1896, the party has generally positioned itself to the left of the Republican Party on economic issues. It was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party. Since the 1860s, its main political rival has been the Republican Party. Before 1860, the Democratic Party supported limited government and state sovereignty while opposing a national bank and high tariffs. The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the modern Democratic Party. The Democrats benefited from white Southerners' resentment of Reconstruction after the war and consequent hostility to the Republican Party. The Democratic Party had a small yet decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery. In 1854, angry with the Kansas–Nebraska Act, anti-slavery Democrats left the party and joined Northern Whigs to form the Republican Party. Foreign policy was a major issue. The Democrats and Whigs were evenly balanced in the 1830s and 1840s. However, by the 1850s, the Whigs disintegrated. Other opposition parties emerged but the Democrats were dominant.

The Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the supremacy of Congress over the executive branch as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. The early 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of decline in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together. Members of the party are called "Democrats" or "Dems". The term "Democrat Party" has also been in local use but has usually been used by opponents since 1952 as a disparaging term.

[2024-06-14 14:53:52,925] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin is a book by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published to document the veracity of the depiction of slavery in Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Uncle Tom is the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin. These terms infuriated Stowe, so 

 Uncle Tom's Children is a collection of novellas and the first book published by African-American author Richard Wright, who went on to write Native Son (1940), Black Boy (1945), and The Outsider (1953).

The process is called photophosphorylation. A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite 

 In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. One ATP is invested in Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP. It occurs in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane and consists of transmembrane protein complexes that catalyze redox reactions. As protons move down the electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane protein ATP synthase, ATP is generated from ADP and an inorganic phosphate group. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Found in all known forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space. In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain releases the chemical energy of O2 to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix – yields ATP by ATP 

Some examples of metabolic pathways involved in ATP production include glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis is the initial step in glucose metabolism and occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. It involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP. The pyruvate produced from glycolysis then enters the mitochondria where it undergoes further processing in the Krebs cycle. Oxidative phosphorylation takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is the main pathway for ATP production. It involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen through a series of protein complexes called the electron transport chain (ETC). As electrons pass through the ETC, energy is released and used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This creates an electrochemical gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP by the enzyme ATP synthase. These metabolic pathways work in concert to efficiently produce ATP, the primary energy currency of cells.

The song samples the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus by Joseph M. Scriven, who wrote it in 1855 to comfort his mother in Iceland while he was living in Canada. On the song, Maher sings about the joy of our friendship with the Saviour. Aleteia described the song as "switching gears from quiet worship to bouncing folk-rock, with a country-pop hook, where the piece is infused with a jubilant energy, which is aided by a perfectly employed gospel-ish choir." "What a Friend" is a song performed by Canadian contemporary Christian music (CCM) artist Matt Maher. "Amazing Grace" is a Christian hymn published in 1779, with words written in 1772 by the English poet and Anglican clergyman John Newton (1725–1807). Newton wrote the words from personal experience. Although the lyrics were originally composed, the music and melody of this adaptation resembled the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus, originally written by Joseph M. Scriven as a poem in 1855. hymn was first published in a leaflet with a tune composed by Kingham titled "Benson". "God Is Working His Purpose Out" was then published nationwide in the Church of England's "Church Missionary Hymn Book". It also started to be published within public school hymnals, however when it was published in "Public School Hymn Book" the tune was changed from "Benson" to a newly commissioned tune titled "Alveston". Some modern hymn books also do not use "Benson" as the tune, instead using "Purpose", written by Martin Shaw in 1953. although Common Praise (the successor to Hymns Ancient and Modern) continues to do so. Scriven is great-great-grandnephew of Joseph Scriven, Irish poet, best known as the writer of the poem which became the hymn "What a Friend We Have in Jesus".

 Cruttenden became a friend of Methodist George Whitefield in 1742, after hearing John Cennick preach at the recently built wooden Tabernacle. Here he experienced a spiritual conversion, which was described in print by Whitefield, attracting interest and criticism. Cruttenden wrote seven or so hymns, published after his death: 'And is it yet, dear Lord, a doubt?' 'Did Jesus die, but not for me?’ ‘I own my guilt, my sins confess;' 'Let others boast their ancient line;' 'Rise, Sun of glory, shine reveal'd;' ' 'Tis false, thou vile accuser, go;' 'What adverse powers we feel within.' Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including Isaac Watts – whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing  –  and Charles Wesley, with whom Newton was familiar. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the common meter in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables 

 Sankey began to compose hymn tunes during the first Moody-Sankey tour of Britain in 1873–1875. These hymns include "The Ninety and Nine", "Beneath the Cross of Jesus", "Hiding in Thee", "A Shelter in the Time of Storm" and "While the days are going by".

Disney board member Stanley Gold said Katzenberg had been brought low by "his ego and almost pathological need to be important." In the United States, copyright will not expire until 95 years after publication for each of Milne's books first published before 1978, but this includes the illustrations. In 2008, a collection of original illustrations featuring Winnie-the-Pooh and his animal friends sold for more than £1.2 million at auction in Sotheby's, London. Forbes magazine ranked Winnie the Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002; Winnie the Pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than $5.9 billion. In 2005, Winnie the Pooh generated $6 billion, a figure surpassed by only Mickey Mouse. Sometime around 2000, the Pooh Properties Trust licensed additional rights to Disney and accepted a buyout of their claims to royalties as defined in a 1991 lawsuit brought by Stephen Slesinger, Inc. Although Slesinger's rights are arguably more valuable, the combined value paid by Disney to The Pooh Properties Trust is said to be approximately $300 million for Milne's portion of those rights. To further minimize Disney's legal exposure to Slesinger, Disney paid money to the Pooh Properties attorneys and trusts to use the name of Clare Milne, daughter of Christopher Robin, in an attempt to terminate certain of the copyright rights 

 After Disney purchased the rights for Winnie the Pooh to make a 1966 animated short film, the company conceded to a broad licensing agreement with Sears, Roebuck & Co.. Stephen Slesinger Inc.'s Pati Slesinger found merchandise that Disney did not pay royalties on. In 1983, Disney paid Stephen Slesinger Inc. and the Milne estate to end the royalty issue and agreed to a new contract that lowered Slesinger Inc.'s royalty percentage. In 1979, the Intergovernmental Philatelic Corporation of New York was licensed by Walt Disney Productions to make Disney character stamps for several countries. On April 21, 2019, Disney, through several tweets, criticized Disney CEO Bob Iger's compensation. After Milne's death in 1956, thirteen days after his 74th birthday, his widow sold her rights to the Pooh characters to Stephen Slesinger, whose widow sold the rights after Slesinger's death to the Walt Disney Company, which has made many Pooh cartoon movies, a Disney Channel television show, as well as Pooh-related 

 Stephen Slesinger created brands and trademarks for literary and cartoon characters. He is credited with creating the image of Winnie the Pooh in his red shirt when he obtained exclusive rights from A.

In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, 

 The motor system is the set of central and peripheral structures in the nervous system that support motor functions, i.e. Peripheral structures may include skeletal muscles and neural connections with muscle tissues.

 Excluding reflexes, all skeletal muscles contractions occur as a result of conscious effort originating in the brain. The brain sends electrochemical signals through the nervous system to the motor neuron that innervates several muscle fibers.

Their axons synapse on the spinal motor neurons of multiple muscles as well as on spinal interneurons. There are two types of motor neuron – upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors. A single motor neuron may innervate many muscle fibres and a muscle fibre can undergo many action potentials in the time taken for a single muscle twitch. Innervation takes place at a neuromuscular junction and twitches can become superimposed as a result of summation or a tetanic contraction. Development Motor neurons begin to develop early in embryonic development, and motor function continues to develop well into childhood. The axons of motor neurons begin to appear in the fourth week of development from the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis (the basal plate). In the spinal column, Hox 4-11 sort motor neurons to one of the five motor columns.

Members to the Seats reserved for Women and Non-Muslims, are elected in accordance with law through proportional representation system of political party's lists of candidates on the basis of total number of General Seats secured by each political party in the National Assembly or a Provincial Assembly. There were 72 Members of Parliament, including 40 from East Bengal, 21 from West Punjab, 4 from the Northwest Frontier Province, 5 from Sindh, 1 from Balochistan and 1 from Karachi. There were 156 seats of members of Parliament, including 78 from East Pakistan and 78 from West Pakistan. There were 156 Members of Parliament, including 78 from East Pakistan and 78 from West Pakistan. He was elected to the National Assembly of Pakistan from Constituency NA-21 (Mansehra-II) as a candidate of Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) (JUI-F) in by-polls held in January 2010. He received 36,622 votes and defeated Zur Gul Khan, a candidate of Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q). He ran for the seat of the National Assembly from Constituency NA-21 (Mansehra-cum-Tor Ghar) as a candidate of JUI-F in 2013 Pakistani general election but was unsuccessful. He was elected to the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a candidate of Awami National Party (ANP) from Constituency PK-35 (Torghar) in 2018 Pakistani general election. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly is the unicameral legislative body of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. After the merger of FATA with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, the assembly seats rose from 124 to 145 by adding 16 general seats, 4 seats reserved for women and 1 for a Non-Muslim. Prior to the elections, the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) formed an alliance with the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) and Awami National Party, while the main opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) allied with the Pakistan Muslim League (F) and Baloch parties. the Senate of Pakistan, ; the National Assembly of Pakistan, ; the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, ; the Provincial Assembly of Sindh, ; the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan and ; the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Paktunkhwa The Electoral College of Pakistan is formed by a joint sitting of the six leading political bodies in Pakistan: So that each province has an equal vote, all provincial assemblies are given exactly 65 votes in the electoral college. This mean that the each member of the Punjab Assembly has 65/370 = 0.176 votes, each member of the Sindh Assembly has 65/168 = 0.387 votes, each member of the KPK Assembly has 65/124 = 0.524 votes and each member of the Balochistan Assembly has 65/65 = 1 vote.

Yet details on when and what mRNA is translated and what mechanisms are responsible for this control are key to understanding of normal and pathological cell functionality. The DNA copies are created by the pairing of nucleotides to bases present on each strand of the original DNA molecule. This problem was overcome in the 1960s by the use of reticulocytes in vertebrates, which produce large quantities of mRNA that are highly enriched in RNA encoding alpha- and beta-globin (the two major protein chains of hemoglobin). However, there are notable differences between the two processes in these cell types. In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, which is the cytoplasm. This process does not require extensive regulation and occurs in a simplified manner compared to eukaryotes. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells have their DNA enclosed in a nucleus, where transcription occurs. Transcription in eukaryotes requires the chromatin structure to change so that the DNA becomes accessible to RNA polymerase. Once the RNA molecule is transcribed, it undergoes additional processing steps, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, as well as the removal of introns. This processed mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. In eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in ribosomes, which are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. The process of decoding the information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation. The ribosome moves along the mRNA, reading each codon and adding the corresponding amino acid until it reaches a stop codon, at which point the polypeptide chain is released. DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and information transfer in cells through a process called transcription. During transcription, a specific region of DNA, known as a gene, is "unzipped" to expose the bases. The RNA molecule formed during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis takes place. Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing, including the removal of non-coding regions called introns and the addition of a protective cap and a poly-A tail. This processed mRNA is then transported out of the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the mRNA molecule serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) play significant roles in this process. Ribosomes, composed of rRNA and proteins, bind to the mRNA at the start codon, and tRNA molecules bring the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome. This forms a polypeptide chain, which subsequently folds into a functional protein. In summary, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis through transcription, where the genetic information encoded in DNA is transcribed and transferred to RNA molecules. These proteins are essential for various cellular functions, including cell structure, signaling, and metabolism. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerases are required to duplicate the cell's DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. Ribozymes (ribonucleic acid enzymes) are RNA molecules that have the ability to catalyze specific biochemical reactions, including RNA splicing in gene expression, similar to the action of protein enzymes. The most common activities of natural or in vitro-evolved ribozymes are the cleavage or ligation of RNA and DNA and peptide bond formation. Within the ribosome, ribozymes function as part of the large subunit ribosomal RNA to link amino acids during protein synthesis. The process is promoted by RNA polymerases. A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP.

A recent folk tradition that adapts a custom from France is the Tintamarre parade of Acadia, similar to France's Medieval Charivari festivities. Today, the Graoully remains one of the major symbols of Metz. Other aspects of Quebec folklore include superstitions surrounding objects, events, and dreams. Listed below are objects along with a brief description of the superstition associated with them. The Quebec Winter Carnival (Carnaval de Québec), commonly known in both English and French as Carnaval, is a pre-Lenten festival held in Quebec City. After being held intermittently since 1894, the Carnaval de Québec has been celebrated annually since 1955. That year, Bonhomme Carnaval, the mascot of the festival, made his first appearance. Up to one million people attended the Carnaval de Québec in 2006 making it, at the time, the largest winter festival in the world (since overtaken by the Harbin Festival).

Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:54:03 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:The folklore of French Canada includes some rituals associated with Church holidays. A recent folk tradition that adapts a custom from France is the Tintamarre parade of Acadia, similar to France's Medieval Charivari festivities. Today, the Graoully remains one of the major symbols of Metz. Other aspects of Quebec folklore include superstitions surrounding objects, events, and dreams. Listed below are objects along with a brief description of the superstition associated with them. The Quebec Winter Carnival (Carnaval de Québec), commonly known in both English and French as Carnaval, is a pre-Lenten festival held in Quebec City. After being held intermittently since 1894, the Carnaval de Québec has been celebrated annually since 1955. That year, Bonhomme Carnaval, the mascot of the festival, made his first appearance. Up to one million people attended the Carnaval de Québec in 2006 making it, at the time, the largest winter festival in the world (since overtaken by the Harbin Festival).

 Sir Michael Philip Jagger (born 26 July 1943) is an English singer, songwriter, actor, and film producer who has achieved international fame as the lead vocalist and one of the founder members of the Rolling Stones. His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Keith Richards' guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones's trademark throughout the band's career. Jagger began writing the song in early 1968 when the Stones still had guitarist Brian Jones as a member. Nearly all rhythm and lead guitar parts were recorded by Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones' other guitarist and the primary songwriting partner of their lead singer Mick Jagger; together the two wrote all but one of the tracks on the album. Rounding out the instrumentation were bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, though all members contributed on a variety of instruments.

In Galatians, Paul says that James, Peter and John will minister to the "circumcised" (in general Jews and Jewish proselytes) 

 among the Gentiles", them being according to Paul "those who were supposed to be acknowledged leaders": James, Cephas and John. He describes this as a "private meeting" (not a public council) and notes that Titus, who was Greek, wasn't pressured to be circumcised. However, he refers to "false believers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might enslave us." Paul claims the "pillars" of the Church had no differences with him. He does not engage in a dispute with those Corinthians who apparently feel quite free to eat anything offered to idols, never appealing or even mentioning the Jerusalem council. Paul himself described several meetings with the apostles in Jerusalem, though it is difficult to reconcile any of them fully with the account in Acts (see also Paul the Apostle). They tried to enforce Jewish circumcision upon the Gentile converts to early Christianity and were strenuously opposed and criticized for their behavior by the Apostle Paul, which employed many of his epistles to refute their doctrinal errors. This conflict between Paul and his opponents may have been the reason for the Council of Jerusalem. Paul criticized Peter for himself declining to eat with gentiles during a visit by some of these Christians and therefore presenting a poor example to non-Jews joining the Christians. Those that taught that gentile converts to Christianity ought to adopt more Jewish practices to be saved, however, were called "Judaizers". Though the Apostle Peter was initially sympathetic, the Apostle Paul opposed the teaching at the Incident at Antioch and at the Council of Jerusalem. Paul insisted that faith in Christ (see also Faith or Faithfulness) was sufficient for salvation, therefore the Mosaic Law wasn't binding for the Gentiles. Paul was in contact with this community. He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, "the Brother of the Lord," which may explain why the early texts contain scarce information about Peter. According to Dunn, this was not an "usurpation of power," but a consequence of Peter's involvement in missionary activities. He persuaded the leaders of the Jerusalem Church to allow gentile converts exemption from most Jewish commandments at the Council of Jerusalem, which opened the way for a much larger Christian Church, extending far beyond the Jewish community. While Paul was inspired by the early Christian apostles, his writings elaborate on their teachings, and also give interpretations which are different from other teachings as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James. Paul was, before his conversion, an antagonist of the followers of Jesus. Initially he persecuted the "church of God." The historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles is disputed.

 The film won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2006, and was in the official selection for the 2006 New York and Toronto International Film Festivals. Steve Dollar, who saw the documentary at Camden, commented in Filmmaker that "the story is as quietly heartbreaking as it is hopeful in the childrens' zest not only to abide but to transform the damaged world around them". The film was selected for the national competition at Cinema Verite, and was shown at the Olympia film festival in Greece. Marjane Satrapi (born in 1969) is an Iranian-born writer known for her graphic memoir Persepolis (2000) and subsequent film adaptation by the same name in 2007.

[2024-06-14 14:54:06,715] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: Thirty people have served as Prime Minister of Australia since the office was created in 1901. Since the office was established in 1901, 29 men and one woman have served as prime minister. Robert Menzies and Kevin Rudd served two non-consecutive terms in office while Alfred Deakin and Andrew Fisher served three non-consecutive terms; the 30th and current 

 at the 1903 federal election and continued to hold the balance of power. Immigration was a prominent topic in the lead up to Australian Federation. At the third Session of the Australasian Federation Convention of 1898, Western Australian premier and future federal cabinet member John Forrest summarised the prevailing feeling: The Barton Government which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the Protectionist Party with the support of the Australian Labor Party. George Reid of the Free Trade Party adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs. non-Labour lines prior to the 1906 federal election and renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm. In 1886, he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council, the traditional preserve of the squatters, representing South Yarra Province, and remained a member until 1901. He was awarded a knighthood in the 1918 New Year Honours, becoming Sir Simon Fraser. Sir Edmund "Toby" Barton, (18 January 1849 – 7 January 1920) was an Australian politician and judge who served as the first prime minister of Australia from 1901 to 1903, holding office as the leader of the Protectionist Party. He resigned to become a founding member of the High Court of Australia, where he served until his death. Barton was an early supporter of the federation of the Australian colonies, the goal of which he summarised as "a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation". Only Edmund Barton, Earle Page, 

 The Prime Minister's Department was created in July 1911, initiated on a small scale compared to other government departments of the day. In 1968, Prime Minister John Gorton split a section of the Prime Minister's Department off, to form the Department of the Cabinet Office with the responsibility to service the Cabinet and the committees of Cabinet. The Prime Minister of the day, William McMahon, told media that the former system with separate departments for Cabinet and for the Prime Minister, that had been operating since 1968, was inefficient. Robert Menzies undertook postgraduate studies that resulted in a substantive master's degree. Many of Australia's early prime ministers had limited formal education and left school at a young age to seek employment. In the 1901 election, he was elected to the Australian Senate as the youngest member of the Parliament, where he supported the Protectionist Party governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin. He supported the establishment of a system of compulsory conciliation and arbitration a Commonwealth old-age pension scheme and a White Australia. He sat on the backbench during Deakin's Fusion government.

The game was sophisticated for its time, but was a commercial failure, released around the time of the video game crash of 1983 when the North American home video game market collapsed. Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo Vs. System, starting with Baseball (1983) and Tennis (1984). The service allowed Atari 2600 owners to use a specialized cartridge to connect through a phone line to a central server and rent a video game for 5–10 days. The GameLine service was terminated during the video game crash of 1983. From 1987 to 2003, Nintendo's Japan-only Disk Writer kiosks allowed users to copy from a jukebox style of rotating stock of the latest games to their floppy disks. They can keep each one for an unlimited time, and play at home on the Famicom and Famicom Disk System for ¥500, then about US$3.25 and 1/6 of the price of many new games. There were also examples such as Soft bender TAKERU for PCs, which also served as a distribution system for karaoke. With the lowered prices, popularity of the video game industry continued to grow and the first video game magazine, Electronic Games, was printed. However, attempts to copycat on the success of the Atari 2600 saturated the market, and the video game crash of 1983 decimated the industry in the United States. With the American-produced games on the downswing, Nintendo successfully launched the Nintendo Entertainment System in America in 1985, revitalizing the market with the introduction of the third and fourth generation of home consoles such as the Master System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari 7800, and the TurboGrafx-16, with systems transitioning to support 3D graphics and support for optical media rather than cartridges. The NES featured a number of groundbreaking games, such as the platform game Super Mario Bros. and the action-adventure games The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, each of which became long-running Nintendo franchises. The NES was succeeded in 1990 by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The opening sections of Nintendo Entertainment System games such as Metroid, The Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Bros. are all designed in such a way that players are forced to explore the mechanics of the game to be able to advance. Super Mario Bros. is the first side-scrolling video game featuring Mario, and one of the first video games directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto. Rather than confront the player with obstacles indiscriminately, the first level of Super Mario Bros. introduces the variety of hazards and objects by directing the player to interact with them while advancing through the level. Miyamoto explained that he designed World 1-1 to contain everything players need to "gradually and naturally understand what they're doing", to be able to play more freely, so that it becomes "their game". Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from game design to business practices. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES. Nintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016. To capitalize on educational games, which were popular at the time, Nintendo partnered with Radical Entertainment to create an educational Mario game. Nintendo licensed the Mario characters but was otherwise not involved in the game's development, nor was Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo later re-released the game for their own video game consoles. In the United States, The Software Toolworks had released the NES and SNES versions by June 1993.

The frequency of the Lan-negative blood type is estimated at 1 in 50,000 in Japanese populations, 1 in 20,000 in Caucasians, and 1 in 1,500 in black people from South Africa.

Knowing the blood types of both the donor and the receiver in a blood transfusion or organ transplant is important because it helps prevent potentially life-threatening reactions. The main reason for this is the presence of antibodies in the recipient's blood that can react with the antigens present on the donor's blood cells. It classifies blood into different types based on the presence or absence of antigens A and B on red blood cells. People with blood type A have A antigens, blood type B have B antigens, blood type AB have both A and B antigens, and blood type O have neither A nor B antigens. If a recipient receives blood that contains antigens that their body recognizes as foreign (not present in their own blood), their immune system will produce antibodies against these antigens. These antibodies can then cause a severe reaction when they encounter the foreign antigens in the transfused blood. For example, individuals with blood type A can receive blood from type A or type O donors. In summary, knowing the blood types of both the donor and the recipient is crucial in blood transfusions and organ transplants to prevent immune reactions that can have severe consequences, such as haemolytic reactions. Blood compatibility ensures a safer and more successful outcome for the recipient. VIRAL HEPATITIS

Donated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.All blood donations are tested for infection with the organisms that cause viral hepatitis, AIDS, selected other viral disorders (such as West Nile virus), Chagas' disease, and syphilis.A person with AB-positive blood has red blood cells that have A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative. Therefore, before a transfusion, blood banks do a test called a "type and crossmatch" on the donor's and the recipient's blood. However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells. People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients. Generally, donors are not allowed to give blood more than once every 56 days. That is why health officials have restricted blood donor eligibility and made blood testing thorough. All blood donations are tested for infection with the organisms that cause viral hepatitis, AIDS, selected other viral disorders (such as West Nile virus), Chagas' disease, and syphilis. VIRAL HEPATITIS

Donated blood is tested for infection with the viruses that cause the types of viral hepatitis (types B and C) that are transmitted by blood transfusions.Hepatitis B remains the most common potentially serious disorder transmitted by blood transfusions, with a current risk of about 1 infection for every 137,000 units of blood transfused.AIDS

A blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type.The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative.Some blood types are far more common than others.Conditions that permanently disqualify a person from donating blood include hepatitis B or C, heart disease, certain types of cancer (leukemia, lymphoma, and any type of cancer that has recurred after treatment or that has ever been treated with chemotherapy drugs), severe asthma, bleeding disorders, possible exposure to prion diseases (such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—see Overview of Prion Diseases), AIDS, and possible exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS) due to high-risk behaviors (see Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection). Blood Typing

Blood is classified by type. A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. For example, a person with O-negative blood has red blood cells that lack both A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative. A blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type.This test minimizes the chance of a dangerous or possibly fatal reaction.However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells.Thus, people with type O blood are known as universal donors.People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients.

[2024-06-14 14:54:08,953] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: "Hot Cop" is a song by the American disco group Village People recorded for their third studio album Cruisin' (1978). It was written by Jacques Morali and Village People lead singer Victor Willis. It served as Willis' theme song with the Village People. The song featured in the 2009 film Paul Blart: Mall Cop, in which it was used as the main character's cell phone ringtone which prevented him from solving cases. "Hot Cop" is a mid-tempo disco song. Allmusic critic Amy Hanson describes the vocals as having a "funk style" that ranges from "righteous rolling to spoken word come-ons a la Earth, Wind & Fire." The lyrics are somewhat self-referential, as Willis dressed as a "Hot Cop" within the Village People concept, wearing a full policeman uniform. "Bad Boys" is a 1987 song by the Jamaican reggae band Inner Circle, which gained high popularity in the United States after its re-release in 1993, peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number seven on the Top 40 Mainstream. It is well known as the opening theme to the American TV show Cops and the theme song of the Bad Boys franchise. about a group of North Las Vegas undercover cops and their unorthodox methods working in a narcotics unit. The theme music was Jackson's "Nasty", performed by Lisa Keith, though the lyrics were slightly changed to make the song more pertinent to the storyline. USA Network used "Nasty" in a promo for the seventh season of the series Psych, with past snippets from the show put together to create the song's call and response portion. Buckcherry sang 

 In 2007, a remix with additional dancehall beats and vocals by Danish reggae singer Natasja Saad was released, titled "Calabria 2007", by Rune and Johannes Torpe under the name Enur. Although Allmusic critic Amy Hanson found "Hot Cop" to be "dismally boring" she describes it as a "tribute to the triumph of the disco scene, as Victor Willis patrolled the floors, letting all who dared to dance know, 'this is the hot cop talking to you. "Hot Cop" was a disco hit during the late 1970s disco scene. Allmusic's Hanson praises the song's vocals, both the "powerful vocals" of lead singer Willis and the backing vocals provided by the other Village People members. Marc Zakem of The Courier-Journal praises the lyrical wit and musical vitality of "Hot Cop" stating that it is "the first disco song I've heard in a long time in which I can actually imagine a roomful of dancing people." and  Paul Green of Billboard Magazine criticizes the "standard disco cliche" of the refrain, with its "Party, boogie, boogie" lyrics. "Cops and Robbers" is a single by English pop rock band the Hoosiers. The song has been noted for its remarkable similarities to "The Lovecats" by the Cure. "Rehab" is a song written and recorded by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, from her second and final studio album Back to Black (2006). Produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic. "Rehab" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US. "Rehab" became an international critical and commercial success, and has been referred to as Winehouse's signature song. It won three Grammy Awards at the 50th ceremony, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, and subsequent death, have contributed to the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a list of artists, such as Hot Chip, Lea Salonga, Seether, and the Jamaican mento band The Jolly Boys. Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity.

Marc Zakem of The Courier-Journal praises the lyrical wit and musical vitality of "Hot Cop" stating that it is "the first disco song I've heard in a long time in which I can actually imagine a roomful of dancing people." and  Paul Green of Billboard Magazine criticizes the "standard disco cliche" of the refrain, with its "Party, boogie, boogie" lyrics. "Cops and Robbers" is a single by English pop rock band the Hoosiers. The song has been noted for its remarkable similarities to "The Lovecats" by the Cure. "Rehab" is a song written and recorded by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, from her second and final studio album Back to Black (2006). Produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical and address Winehouse's refusal to enter a rehabilitation clinic. "Rehab" was released as the lead single from Back to Black in 2006, and it peaked at number 7 in the United Kingdom on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Winehouse's only top 10 hit in the US. "Rehab" became an international critical and commercial success, and has been referred to as Winehouse's signature song. It won three Grammy Awards at the 50th ceremony, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, and subsequent death, have contributed to the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a list of artists, such as Hot Chip, Lea Salonga, Seether, and the Jamaican mento band The Jolly Boys. Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity.

Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay.

  Advocates of raising the minimum wage assert this would provide households with more money to spend, while opponents recognize the impact this has on businesses', especially small businesses', ability to pay additional workers. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families.

The fight to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 promises stiff resistance from business interests. ''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the Senate on November 19, 2013. S. 1737 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour, and to adjust the wage annually thereafter to account for inflation. In addition, the bill would increase the federal minimum cash wage for workers who receive tips by gradually raising that wage until it equals 70 percent of the federal minimum wage for other workers. The latter figure is similar to the proposal in the U.S. Congress, known as Minimum Wage Fairness Act. This amendment was defeated. The Minimum Wage Fairness Act is a bill that would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. This would effectively repeal the federal minimum wage.

[2024-06-14 14:54:10,555] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Their powers are derived not only from the Fire Rescue Services Act 2004 but also Article 27 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the Health & Safety at Work Act etc 1974, Fireworks Act 2003, and the Licensing Act 2003 including other pieces of legislation. An employee of a fire and rescue authority who is authorised in writing by the authority for the purposes of Section 25 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and on duty may: An authorised employee may in particular:

 In England and Wales, the powers to make building regulations were consolidated and re-enacted in 1984. All building regulations made by the Secretary of State since then have included minimum fire safety measures (for both physical fire resistance and safe means of escape) for all new, extended or altered buildings. The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. Note: building regulations and fire safety laws are different, but similar, in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Prior to the Order, under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, all public and commercial buildings, and all non-single-household domestic dwellings (apart from houses in multiple occupation), were required to hold a valid fire safety certificate issued annually after an inspection by the Fire Service. This regime was replaced with assessment by third-party fire-risk assessors contracted by building owners and landlords, with no mandated timeframe for checks, and no mandated professional qualifications. In 2013, the Fire Service found that 14% of risk assessments were non-compliant with the law, and in 2018 it was found that 500 out of 800 of the UK's fire risk assessors were not registered with accredited bodies. Once a building is occupied the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (Fire Safety Order 2005 - FSO2005) requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the "Responsible Person(s)" for the building to provide and maintain "suitable and sufficient" general fire precautions. Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect. Enforcement is by the local fire authority. 1) A fire and rescue authority. ; a construction site or building under reconstruction as a whole (note; if the premises is partly 

 (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.)

An employee of a fire and rescue authority who is authorised in writing by the authority for the purposes of Section 25 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and on duty may: An authorised employee may in particular:

 In England and Wales, the powers to make building regulations were consolidated and re-enacted in 1984. All building regulations made by the Secretary of State since then have included minimum fire safety measures (for both physical fire resistance and safe means of escape) for all new, extended or altered buildings. The current building regulation's fire safety documents were last revised and issued in 2006. A major simplification and enlargement of the scope of the English and Welsh fire safety laws was implemented by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (RR (FS)O 2005, in force 1 October 2006). The new Fire Safety Order again amended and extended the scope of fire safety provision within the Building Regulations 2000. Note: building regulations and fire safety laws are different, but similar, in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Prior to the Order, under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, all public and commercial buildings, and all non-single-household domestic dwellings (apart from houses in multiple occupation), were required to hold a valid fire safety certificate issued annually after an inspection by the Fire Service. This regime was replaced with assessment by third-party fire-risk assessors contracted by building owners and landlords, with no mandated timeframe for checks, and no mandated professional qualifications. In 2013, the Fire Service found that 14% of risk assessments were non-compliant with the law, and in 2018 it was found that 500 out of 800 of the UK's fire risk assessors were not registered with accredited bodies. Once a building is occupied the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (Fire Safety Order 2005 - FSO2005) requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the "Responsible Person(s)" for the building to provide and maintain "suitable and sufficient" general fire precautions. Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect. Enforcement is by the local fire authority. 1) A fire and rescue authority. ; a construction site or building under reconstruction as a whole (note; if the premises is partly 

 (Revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.) Following several small fires in chemical plants and a major explosion and fire at the Nypro plant in Flixborough on 1 June 1974, the Government decided to require fire certificates for major chemical and other risks and to give enforcement to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It issued the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976 (SI 1976/2003), enforced by the HSE on a similar line to the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The regulations applied to whole sites rather than the single premise or building approach used in the Fire Precautions Act 1971. (These regulations were revoked by the RR (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for England and Wales; see below.)

Some of the song's images reference the recent history of Springsteen's hometown Freehold Borough, New Jersey, in particular the racial strife in 1960s New Jersey and economic tensions from the same times (such as the "textile mill being closed" was the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold). The song has been described as Springsteen's best recorded vocal, with an unerring sincerity which fuels the song. Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He has released twenty studio albums, many of which feature his backing band the E Street Band. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours in length. Springsteen released his first two albums, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle 

 "Somebody Have Mercy" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sam Cooke, originally released in April 1962 on the album Twistin' the Night Away. The Balham Alligators ; Gary U.S. Bonds and Bruce Springsteen (Springsteen had originally recorded the song for his 1980 album, The River, but it was never released and he decided to re-record the song with Bonds for his 1981 album, Dedication) . ; The Flatlanders ; Joan Baez included a recording of the song on her 1970 album (I Live) One Day at a Time. The title of the song is referenced in Mary Chapin Carpenter's 1991 song "Down at the Twist and Shout" and Adam Carroll's 2000 song "Errol's Song". Author June Skinner Sawyers describes the theme of the song to be "the struggle to create meaning for oneself." She notes that it "just tells a story, honestly and simply, offering one of Springsteen's most precise lyrics." Springsteen's biographer Dave Marsh wrote that the recording fades away "without a nuance of reluctance. Music critic Clinton Heylin has suggested that it may have begun as a continuation of that song, as "Stolen Car" originally used similar language to explain the marriage failure: "We got married and promised never to part/Then I feel a victim to a hungry heart." "Stolen Car," along with a few other songs on The River including the title track and "Wreck on the Highway", mark a new direction in Bruce Springsteen's songwriting. These ballads, imbued with a sense of hopelessness, foreshadow his next album, Nebraska. The 

 The song is a tribute to two anarchists of Italian origin, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were sentenced to death by a United States court in the 1920s for the murder of a payroll clerk and a guard. The lyrics for "Here's to You" make use of a statement attributed to Vanzetti by Philip D. Strong, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, who visited Vanzetti 

 This is Springsteen's first and so far only album of entirely non-Springsteen material and contains his interpretation of thirteen folk music songs made popular by activist folk musician Pete Seeger. Using songs written by others, Seeger focused on popularizing and promoting the ethic of local, historical musical influences and recognizing the cultural significance that folk music embodies. Springsteen's project began in 1997, when he recorded "We Shall Overcome" for the Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger tribute album, released the following year. This group would become the Sessions Band. The subsequent Bruce Springsteen with the Seeger Sessions Band Tour expanded on the album's musical approach.

 The United States dollar (symbol: ; code: USD; also abbreviated US$ or U.S. Dollar, to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; referred to as the dollar, U.S. dollar, American dollar, or colloquially buck) is the official currency of the United States and its territories. The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. U.S. banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes, popularly called greenbacks due to their historically predominantly green color. The Gold 

 The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to "borrow money on the credit of the United States." Congress has exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Notes. Those notes are "obligations of the United States" and "shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank". Since 1928, it has adorned American $100 bills. From 1948 to 1963, Franklin's portrait was on the half-dollar. He has appeared on a $50 bill and on several varieties of 

 The Treasury seal has been printed on virtually all U.S. federally-issued paper currency, starting with the Legal Tender Notes (United States Notes) in 1862 and continuing today. The only exceptions were the Demand Notes of 1861 (the original "greenbacks") and the first three issues of fractional (less than a dollar) notes in the 1860s; in both cases the authorizing laws did not require the seal. Initially the U.S. Government had no means to produce bills on its own, so the first paper bills were printed by private firms and then sent to the Treasury Department for final processing.

[2024-06-14 14:54:12,183] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:These nerve fibers play a crucial role in transmitting information between the brain and the rest of the body. On the other hand, the gray matter forms an inner butterfly-shaped pattern surrounding the central canal of the spinal cord. It contains the cell bodies of neurons as well as nerve fibers. The sensory neurons have their cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia. It is important to note that the size of the gray matter and, consequently, the size of the spinal cord, can vary at different levels. In areas where the gray matter contains many large motor nerve cells that control limb movement, the gray matter and spinal cord are considerably larger compared to areas where the gray matter contains motor neurons for the muscles of the torso. In summary, the two main parts of the spinal cord are the white matter, responsible for transmitting information to and from the brain, and the gray matter, which contains the cell bodies of neurons and plays a role in motor control and sensory processing. Reference: A cross-section through the lower lumbar region of the spinal cord is shown here. Spinal cord, human, silver stain ×16. 1) Somatic receptors in the skin, muscles and tendons ; 2) Afferent nerve fibers carry signals from the somatic receptors to the posterior horn of the spinal cord or to the brainstem ; 3) An integrating center, the point at which the neurons that compose the gray matter of the spinal cord or brainstem synapse ; 4) Efferent nerve fibers carry motor nerve signals from the anterior horn to the muscles ; 5) Effector muscle innervated by the efferent nerve fiber carries out the response. In vertebrates, most sensory neurons do not pass directly into the brain, but synapse in the spinal cord. This allows for faster reflex actions to occur by activating spinal motor neurons without the delay of routing signals 

The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is a collection of cell bodies of peripheral sensory neurons whose axons enter the spinal cord. The sensory neurons within the DRG have specialized nerve endings in the skin, muscles, and other tissues that detect sensory stimuli. These stimuli are then converted into electrical signals that travel along the axons of the sensory neurons and enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots. Once inside the spinal cord, the sensory information is processed and integrated with other signals before being transmitted to the brain for further interpretation and perception. It houses the cell bodies of sensory neurons and serves as a relay station for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Afferent nociceptive fibers (those that send information to, rather than from the brain) travel back to the spinal cord where they form synapses in its dorsal horn. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. Aδ fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, Aβ fibers connect with lamina I, III, & V. After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order nociceptive project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white commissure. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the cerebral cortex in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. This segment allows the sensory information to be processed and integrated within the central nervous system. In this process, synapses occur only in the gray matter, which is where the cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located. Sensory neurons are classified as pseudounipolar neurons and have cell bodies located in ganglia along the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Reference: They have a single process that divides into a peripheral segment that brings information from the periphery to the cell body and a central segment that carries information from the cell body into the gray matter of the spinal cord. Nuclei of the CNS are the morphologic and functional equivalents of the ganglia of the PNS. The cell bodies of motor neurons that innervate striated muscle are located in the ventral (anterior) horn of the gray matter. Because the motor neuron conducts impulses away from the CNS, it is an efferent neuron. The axon of a motor neuron leaves the spinal cord, passes through the ventral (anterior) root, becomes a component of the spinal nerve of that segment, and as such is conveyed to the muscle. The cell bodies of sensory neurons are located in ganglia that lie on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve. Sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia are pseudounipol. These nerves are carried by sensory nerves and are responsible for transmitting sensory signals to the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous system, afferent and efferent nerve fibers are part of the somatic nervous system and originate outside of the spinal cord. Afferent fibers are carried by sensory nerves into the spinal cord, while efferent fibers are carried by motor nerves out of the spinal cord to act on skeletal muscles. The cell bodies of afferent neurons are located in the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system, specifically in the dorsal root ganglion just outside the spinal cord. For example, certain afferent neurons called intrafusal muscle fibers function as stretch receptors by detecting changes in muscle length. One important pathway is the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which transmits sensations from the periphery via afferent nerve fibers. In summary, afferent nerve fibers serve the role of conveying sensory information from the sensory receptors to the brain.

One or both lips may be affected. ; Oral ulceration (mouth ulcers) which may be aphthous like, or be more chronic and deep with raised margins. ; Gingival enlargement (swelling of the gums). ; Fissured tongue (grooves in the tongue). Dermatologic conditions cause about 75% of cases of desquamative gingivitis, and over 95% of the dermatologic cases are accounted for by either oral lichen planus or cicatricial pemphigoid. The exact cause of desquamative gingivitis cannot be determined about a third of cases. Rare causes include:

 mucous membrane of the mouth, which may be associated with cobblestoning and mucosal tags (similar lesions often occur on the intestinal mucosa in Crohn disease). The facial skin may be dry, exfoliative (flaking) or erythematous. ; Facial palsy (weakness and altered sensation of the face). Signs and symptoms may include: The enlargement of the tissues of the mouth, lips and face seen in OFG is painless. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is where OFG occurs with fissured tongue and paralysis of the facial nerve. Caused by various autoimmune diseases as well as allergies. ; Involved teeth may have difficulty erupting or may not erupt completely. ; May possibly cause localized periodontal destruction due to aetiological factors. ; May cause fracture of the tuberosity or floor of the maxillary sinus. It is important to diagnose DE early and provide appropriate treatment to help prevent periodontal disease, caries, pulpal complications and malocclusion. Angular cheilitis (AC) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. Often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. Irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. Allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. Treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. Initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). Later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. The mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. Where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. Infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. Sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure ("collapse of jaws"). If there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. In people with angular cheilitis

Long after the decline of the Roman Empire's sea-borne trade with India, the Portuguese were the next Europeans to sail there for the purpose of trade, first arriving by ship in May 1498. The closing of the traditional trade routes in western Asia by the Ottoman Empire, and rivalry with the Italian states sent Portugal in search of an alternate sea route to India. The first successful voyage to India was by Vasco da Gama in 1498, when after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope he arrived in Calicut, now in Kerala. The second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out

Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface ; Defects of ion transport ; Defects of specific hydrolysis ; Impaired enterohepatic circulation ; Mucosal damage (enteropathy) ; Pancreatic insufficiency The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and-fro mixing in the small intestine. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to:

 Isomaltulose is an available carbohydrate like sucrose and most other sugars or maltodextrins, in the sense that it is fully metabolised in the small intestine, and does not enter the large intestine or get excreted in urine. Its intestinal digestion involves the enzyme isomaltase, which is located at the surface of the brush border lining the inner wall of the small intestine. This enzyme is otherwise involved in the digestion of α-1,6 linkages present in starch. The products of isomaltulose digestion are glucose and fructose, which are absorbed and enter the bloodstream. In the Mouth: Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth by saliva. Digestion in the mouth involves the hydrolysis of polysaccharides into disaccharides by amylase. In the stomach: because food is not mixed with gastric secretions in the body of the stomach, very little protein digestion, occurs here. In the interior of the mass, however, carbohydrate digestion continues under the influence of salivary amylase. In the Small Intestine: When gastric contents are emptied into the duodenum, they are mixed they are mixed not only by the juice secreted by the small intestine mucosa but also with the secretions of the exocrine pancreas. Carbohydrate digestion in the small intestine finishes converting digestible polysaccharides and disaccharides into monosaccharides into monosaccharides that can be absorbed. It is important to note that whereas fat digestion is completed within the small intestine lumen, carbohydrate and protien digestions have not been brought to completion. Thus, carbohydrate digestion is competed intracellularly within the confines of the brush border. The disaccharides located in the brush borders of the small intestine cells further reduce these disaccharides into the absorbable monosaccharides units of glucose, galactose, and fructose. Glucose and galactose are both absorbed by secondary active transport, in which cotransport carriers on the luminal border transport both the monosaccharide and Na+ from the lumen into the interior of the intestinal cell. In addition to

The end-product of the action of salivary amylase is maltose. Specifically, salivary amylase hydrolyzes the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch, resulting in the production of maltose. The digestion of carbohydrates involves the action of two types of enzymes: salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase. It continues the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down the oligosaccharides into smaller units called disaccharides, such as maltose and sucrose. Overall, the digestion of carbohydrates involves a combination of salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase, peptidases, and disaccharidases, all working together to break down carbohydrates into absorbable forms such as monosaccharides. Artificial digestion is a laboratory technique that reduces food to protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and non-nutrient compounds for analytical or research purposes. Digestive agents such as pepsin and hydrochloric acid are typically used to accomplish artificial digestion. The purpose of digestion in organisms is to break down large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This occurs through actions like chewing (mastication) in the mouth and segmentation contractions in the small intestine. On the other hand, chemical digestion involves the use of enzymes to break down food into smaller molecules. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth where mechanical digestion begins through mastication and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that starts the digestion of starch. After chewing and starch digestion, the food forms into a bolus and travels down the esophagus into the stomach through the action of peristalsis. In the stomach, gastric juice plays a crucial role in digestion. It contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which initiate protein digestion. Additionally, in infants and toddlers, gastric juice also contains rennin for milk protein digestion. To protect the stomach wall from the potentially damaging effects of gastric juice, mucus and bicarbonates are secreted, forming a slimy layer as a shield.

For instance, crackles actually are rales, and the large amount of words can leave anyone’s head spinning. Knowing what to call what you hear on the other end of the stethoscope can tell you – and the doctor – quite a bit about a patient’s condition. What was once called rhonchi are now called a sonorous wheeze, and this is because they have a snoring, gurgling quality to them. Rhonchi are often a low-pitched moan that is more prominent on exhalation. It differs from wheezes in that wheezes are high and squeaky while these are low and dull. Coarse crackles sound like pouring water out of a bottle or like ripping open Velcro. This lung sound is often a sign of adult respiratory distress syndrome, early congestive heart failure, asthma, and pulmonary oedema. – Listening for lung sounds. Wheezes and rhonchi are actually very closely related. Wheezes are now known as sibilant wheezes to distinguish them from rhonchi. Sibilant wheezes are high-pitched and shrill sounding breath sounds that occur when the airway becomes narrowed. These are the typical wheezes heard when listening to an asthmatic patient. Stridor is an unusual sound that not many adult patients will have, but it bears mentioning. It is a high-pitched, musical sound that is heard over the upper airway. It is also the most common type of breath sound heard in children with croup, though it is important to differentiate between croup and a foreign body airway obstruction. These membranes are usually coated in

Singing or playing womb-like sounds in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may help slow the heart rate and improve sleep and eating patterns of premature babies, a new study suggests. Researchers found infants who had respiratory distress or sepsis tended to do better while listening to their parents sing a lullaby or to sounds mimicking a mother's heartbeat or fluid in the womb. "Neurologic function can be enhanced with music; vital signs can be enhanced through interactive sounds and music therapy," she told Reuters Health. Her new study included 272 preemies being treated at 11 NICUs that had music therapists. At different times over two weeks, babies' parents sang to them or therapists used one of two devices meant to simulate womb sounds for 10 minutes. Loewy and her colleagues compared preemies' vital signs during those periods, as well as their eating and sleeping, to times when no sounds were played. They found the babies' heart rates dropped by one or two beats per minute, on average, while they listened to the lullaby and heartbeat sounds and just after they'd heard other womb-like sounds. Sucking rates sped up with the heartbeat sounds, in particular, and there was a longer-term improvement in sleep patterns tied to the womb-like fluid noises, the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics. Previous research into the soothing effects of music has found mixed results among both babies and, for example, adults on ventilators in intensive care. There were no babies in the new study who were exposed only to silence or quiet talking in the NICU, so the researchers can't say how these preemies would have compared to a no-music group - only that they did better while hearing music. They said the sounds used in these NICUs can be replicated by parents without the help of a music therapist, if one isn't available. "The wonderful thing about these instruments is that the body can take it over," Loewy said. Loewy said she and her colleagues especially encourage parents to sing songs that are important to their family and culture, which can ease their stress as well. "Toning is the art of making elongated vowel sounds and sensing where they internally vibrate," Campbell explains.The sounds used in BioAcoustics are created by frequency generating and filtering equipment, which patients listen to either in a sound room or through headphones. Edwards is in the process of developing computerized techniques to further improve the BioAcoustics technology, in the hopes that this procedure will become a routine part of preventative and diagnostic health care just like blood work or pulse taking. ### Toning

For nine years, the Institute for Music, Health, and Education, in Boulder, Colorado, founded by Don Campbell, has researched and trained students to use toning (making elongated vowel sounds and allowing them to resonate through the body) as a simple way to release stress, balance the mind and body, improve the ear's ability to listen, and improve the speaking and singing voice. When we hear unpleasant sounds such as a fork scraping a plate or nails against a chalk board, the auditory cortex of the brain and an area of the brain called the amygdala interact to produce a negative response. The auditory cortex processes sound, while the amygdala is responsible for processing emotions such as fear, anger, and pleasure. Vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the ossicles of the middle ear. The ossicle bones amplify the sound vibrations as they are passed along to the inner ear. The sound vibrations are sent to the organ of Corti in the cochlea, which contains nerve fibers that extend to form the auditory nerve. As the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid inside the cochlea to move. The auditory nerve receives the nerve impulses and sends them to the brainstem. The temporal lobes organize sensory input and process the auditory information so that the impulses are perceived as sound. Listening to these sounds induced more activity in the amygdala and auditory cortex than did other sounds. Chorus: Oh Aruba sweet land our boulder so beloved our love for you is so strong that nothing can destroy it.

Latz has worked to do this at Duisburg Nord in many ways (Weilacher, 102) and it has been declared as a highly successful cultural park (Steinglass, 129). In the Napoleonic era the border between Unterbilk and its neighbouring district of Frederichstadt was delineated by Düsseldorf's fortifications. Following the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801 the fortifications were demolished and the area became public gardens with two linked ornamental ponds, the Schwanenspiegel and Kaiserteich.

In the film Natural Born Killers (1994), Lineback's character, Sonny, was the first redneck to be shot to death by the murderous couple Mickey Knox (played by Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (played by Juliette Lewis). He played a FBI special agent, McMurphy, in the crime/thriller The Jackal (1997) with Bruce Willis, Richard Gere and Sidney Poitier. Lineback recreated his performance as Al LeFauve for the Showtime film The Baby Dance (1998) co-starring Stockard Channing and Laura Dern. He played the innkeeper in the horror film The Ring (2002) featuring Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. In 1992, Harrelson starred opposite Wesley Snipes in White Men Can't Jump. He then appeared in the Oliver Stone-directed Natural Born Killers (1994) alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downey Jr. For his performance as free-speech activist Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) 

 "Bernard Herrmann's phenomenally eerie Vertigo score, Vangelis's groundbreaking synth-based ambience for Blade Runner, Nino Rota's timeless Godfather suite – any self-appointed buff of the soundtrack genre might blanch at the notion of making shelf-room alongside these classics for a furious miscellaneous music compilation…" wrote Andrew Collins in Q, "but, hey, as Mickey says, 'This is the 1990s,' and, if you were a soundtrack album, you'd be Natural Born Killers." Reportedly, Stone and Reznor wanted to include a track by Snoop Dogg on the soundtrack but Warner Bros. wouldn't allow it as he was, at the time of production, on trial for murder. Killer by Nature is a 2012 American thriller film starring Ron Perlman and Armand Assante. he portrays a suave but murderous conman. He decried Tierney "as the bold, bad killer whose ambition is to 'fix it so's I can spit in anybody's eye,'" being "given outrageous license to demonstrate the histrionics of nastiness." It stars Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny, and Michelle Forbes. The film tells the story of a journalist (Duchovny) and his photographer girlfriend (Forbes) traveling cross-country to research serial killings, who unwittingly carpool with a psychopath (Pitt) and his childlike girlfriend (Lewis). It was released theatrically the following week in the United States, but was a box office bomb, grossing $2.4 million against a nearly $9 million budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its art house sensibility, while others dismissed it as a violent exploitation film. Despite this, the film's acting was largely praised, and critic Roger Ebert heralded the performances of Pitt and Lewis among the best he had ever seen. The film stars James Fox as a violent and ambitious London gangster who, after killing an old friend, goes into hiding at the home of a reclusive rock star (Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones, in his second film). The film was produced in 1968 but not released until 1970, as Warner Bros. was reluctant to distribute the film, owing to its sexual content and graphic violence.

In broad terms, it can be viewed as the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate 

 Toughness in meat is derived from several proteins, such as actin, myosin and collagen, that combined form the structure of the muscle tissue. Heating these proteins causes them to denature, or break down into other substances, which in turn changes the structure and texture of meat, usually reducing its toughness and making it more tender. This continued consumption also results in the production of ethanol by the bacteria, which can make it difficult to determine the blood alcohol content (BAC) in autopsies, particularly in bodies recovered from water. Generally, the term decomposition encompasses the biochemical processes that occur from the physical death of the person (or animal) until the skeletonization of the body. Putrefaction is one of seven stages of decomposition; as such, the term putrescible identifies all organic matter (animal and human) that is biochemically subject to putrefaction. In the matter of death by poisoning, the putrefaction of the body is chemically delayed by poisons such as antimony, arsenic, carbolic acid (phenol), nux vomica (plant), strychnine (pesticide), and zinc chloride. ; Packed (for example in plastic bags) to protect carcasses or cuts ; Chilled or frozen for preservation When the birds are large enough, they are shipped to processing plants for slaughter. When chickens arrive at the processor they go through the following sequence: Further Processing plants carry out operations such as cutting and deboning. 1–2 days: Pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livor mortis are the first steps in the process of decomposition before the process of putrefaction. ; 

Rigor mortis (Latin: rigor "stiffness", and mortis "of death"), or postmortem rigidity, is the third stage of death. Physiology After death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry Rigor mortis is very important

In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry Rigor mortis is very important

The United Kingdom's national anthem is "God Save the Queen" but its constituent countries and Crown Dependencies also have their own national anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition.

For those with a five-day workweek, the length of a work day is set out as 8.6 hours, while those with a six-day workweek have a work day of 8 hours, with a half-day of work on Friday. However, in practice, additional time is added to make up for these breaks, leading to a maximum 45-hour workweek. In the Working Time Directive article 7 refers to paid annual leave of "at least four weeks", but does not directly define a "week", and nor do the regulations. Article 5 states that the "weekly rest period" means a "seven-day period". When the Directive was implemented in the UK, regulation 13 originally stated "four weeks" but many employers only gave their workers four five-day periods of leave (i.e. However, this confusion led to the argument that the UK had gone beyond the minimum standards required by the Working Time Directive 2003, even though no country in the EU has a right to fewer holidays than 28 days. In addition to raising his workers' wages, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day, 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August. Ford had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time. Ford also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. Ford explained, "It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege." Society would have one third of its people working the red week, another third the blue week and the third the white week. Every day throughout the year there would be two groups working their four occupational days of the week and one resting for their two-day weekend. ten-hour workday. On March 26, 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, which was "signed by one thousand citizens of New York and Brooklyn." The ten-hour workday would not be implemented until March 31, 1840, when President Martin Van Buren finally mandated a ten-hour workday for all mechanics and laborers employed on public works." In 1848, the yard had 441 employees who typically worked a ten hour day, six days a week. He hypothesized that it should be possible to have everyone to work one day less, yet maintain their global production (or national GDP) If the population was split into three approximately equal groups (he called them Red, Blue and White to appeal to the French, British and American readers) and everyone in the same family were to work  the same week, then 

 In many North American fire departments, firefighters work 24-hour shifts. Often they will be scheduled in an A–B–C pattern. Workers are considered to be part-time if they commonly work fewer than 30 hours per week.

However, in practice, additional time is added to make up for these breaks, leading to a maximum 45-hour workweek. In the Working Time Directive article 7 refers to paid annual leave of "at least four weeks", but does not directly define a "week", and nor do the regulations. Article 5 states that the "weekly rest period" means a "seven-day period". When the Directive was implemented in the UK, regulation 13 originally stated "four weeks" but many employers only gave their workers four five-day periods of leave (i.e. However, this confusion led to the argument that the UK had gone beyond the minimum standards required by the Working Time Directive 2003, even though no country in the EU has a right to fewer holidays than 28 days. In addition to raising his workers' wages, Ford also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day, 40-hour workweek, with the company's office workers making the transition the following August. Ford had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into their work in exchange for more leisure time. Ford also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. Ford explained, "It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege." Society would have one third of its people working the red week, another third the blue week and the third the white week. Every day throughout the year there would be two groups working their four occupational days of the week and one resting for their two-day weekend. ten-hour workday. On March 26, 1835, the mechanics in the New York Navy Yard petitioned the Board of Navy Commissioners to reduce the workday to ten hours, which was "signed by one thousand citizens of New York and Brooklyn." The ten-hour workday would not be implemented until March 31, 1840, when President Martin Van Buren finally mandated a ten-hour workday for all mechanics and laborers employed on public works." In 1848, the yard had 441 employees who typically worked a ten hour day, six days a week. He hypothesized that it should be possible to have everyone to work one day less, yet maintain their global production (or national GDP) If the population was split into three approximately equal groups (he called them Red, Blue and White to appeal to the French, British and American readers) and everyone in the same family were to work  the same week, then 

 In many North American fire departments, firefighters work 24-hour shifts. Often they will be scheduled in an A–B–C pattern. Workers are considered to be part-time if they commonly work fewer than 30 hours per week. According to the International Labour Organization, the number of part-time workers has increased from one-quarter to a half in the past 20 years in most developed countries, excluding the United States.

It premiered on September 7, 1985, and ran for one season on ABC as a half-hour program. With 13 episodes, it is currently the shortest-running series in the Scooby-Doo franchise to date. A follow-up film, Scooby-Doo! The original thirty-minute version of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo constitutes the fourth incarnation of the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon Scooby-Doo. It premiered on September 22, 1979, and ran for one season on ABC as a half-hour program. By 1979, the staff at Hanna-Barbera realized that the Scooby-Doo formula was getting worn out, which gave them reason to parody it in a 1979 primetime special, Scooby Goes Hollywood, which was produced and finished before the series aired. Tom Ruegger was associate producer and story editor, the irreverent, fourth wall-breaking humor found in each episode resurfaced in his later works, among them A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, Tiny Toon Adventures, and Animaniacs. The original format of four teenagers and their dog(s) solving faux-supernatural mysteries for a half-hour was eschewed for simpler, more comedic adventures that involved real supernatural villains (the villains in previous Scooby episodes were almost always regular humans in disguise). A total of 33 half-hour episodes, each of which included three 7-minute shorts, were produced over three seasons, from 1980 to 1982 on ABC. Thirteen episodes were produced for the 1980–81 season, and seven more for the 1981–82 as segments of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show. The remaining thirteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour for the 1982–83 season. Out of the 99 shorts that were produced, 86 of them feature Scooby-Doo, his nephew Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy without the rest of the Mystery Inc gang, and the other 13 only feature Scrappy-Doo and Yabba-Doo. Running for two seasons, it centered on four teenagers and a dog solving supernatural mysteries, and became one of Hanna-Barbera's most successful creations and has spawned several new spin-offs, such as The New Scooby-Doo Movies, The Scooby-Doo Show, Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo and many others, which were regularly in production at Hanna-Barbera into the 1990s. It premiered on September 10, 1983, featuring the return of Daphne, and ran for one season on ABC as a half-hour program made up of two eleven-minute short cartoons. In 1984, the name of the show was changed to The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries, with the actual show format remaining the same. Thirteen half-hour episodes, composed of twenty-four separate segments were produced under the New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo title in 1983, and thirteen more episodes, composed of twenty separate segments were produced under the name The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries in 1984. At the time, Margaret Loesch, who served as supervising executive for the series, also worked for another animation production company, Marvel Productions.

 Throughout the world, most agroforestry systems have been practiced since the Neolithic period.

Since the 1970s, in line with initiatives taken by other countries, the Indian government has also promoted research in the field of agroforestry. Even though agriculture was valued by social and religious practices; some experts noted that various government regulations were seen as an impediment in advancing agroforestry. Another aspect for the need of an agroforestry policy was the lack of the forest and tree cover in India. According to the Forest Survey of India in 2019, the country had 80.7 million hectares of forest and tree cover, which accounts to 24.56% of the total geographic area in the country; however, the country requires one third (33.3%) of its land under forest and tree cover, according to the National Forest Policy. Transactions in the agriculture sector are heavily dependent on cash and were adversely affected by the demonetisation. Due to scarcity of the new banknotes, many farmers have insufficient cash to purchase seeds, fertilisers and pesticides needed for the plantation of rabi crops usually sown around mid-November. Farmers and their unions conducted protest rallies in Gujarat, Amritsar and Muzaffarnagar against the demonetisation as well as against restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India on district cooperative central banks which were ordered not to accept or exchange the demonetised banknotes.

By 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States.

Agriculture remains the main stay of the Nigerian economy in spite of oil as it employs two-third of the entire working population. Farmers find it hard to plan their operations due to unpredictable rainfall vagaries. The sector is also plagued with outdated land tenure system that limits access to land (1.8 ha/farming household), reduced irrigation development capacity (cropped land under irrigation less than 1 percent), limited access to credits, low adoption of technologies, expensive farm inputs, limited access to fertilizers, inadequate storage facilities and limited market access.

One of the negative impacts was that exclusive studies were not conducted on the benefits and harms before the introduction of the green revolution.

Furthermore, the green revolution promoted the use of high-yielding crop varieties, which require significant amounts of irrigation and inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This led to increased costs for farmers, creating a dependency on external inputs and technologies.

The Finals were originally scheduled for June, but the season was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NBA and its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus. After the NBA suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league started to explore implementing a special postseason format just for this year. Under this plan, the 22 teams played eight regular-season "seeding" games. A possible best-of-three play-in series for the final seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed. The 2020–21 NBA season was the Celtics' 75th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the regular season for the league began on December 22, 2020 and featured a 72-game schedule rather than the typical 82-game schedule.

[2024-06-14 14:54:32,250] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. Nevertheless, the Court indicated that the States still had the right to set 

 The legal drinking age varies from country to country. In the United States, the legal drinking age is currently 21. Setting a legal drinking age of 21 is designed to discourage reckless alcohol consumption by youth, limiting consumption to those who are more mature, who can be expected to make reasonable and wise decisions when it comes to drinking. own drinking ages. Despite this, the Federal Government can assess a 10% penalty on highway funds for states which choose to set their drinking age lower than 21. Less than a year after the Supreme Court ruling, all 50 states of the United States officially made 21 the minimum legal drinking age. Motor vehicle accidents decreased after the legal drinking age was raised, but the MLDA-21 is not the only variable which can be identified as a reason for the declining accident rate. Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. He believed that doing so would decrease the number of accidents related to drunk driving, because he said that states with a drinking age of 21+ did not have as many drunk driving accidents. Reagan said that although he wished states would create their 

 legislation to increase the drinking age, a federal law had to be implemented to avoid blood borders, or teenagers driving to the nearest state with a lower drinking age. Reagan threatened states with withholding 5% of federal funding for highways if they did not comply with increasing the drinking age to 21. In 2007, the drinking age debate in the United States was renewed when Choose Responsibility began promoting the lowering of the drinking age coupled with education and rules to persuade people to drink responsibly before they are of legal age. But data suggest that among people who are middle age, another problem involving excess drinking has been quietly brewing. It has been observed only in the U.S. Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who are spouses and Princeton University economists, have found that the trend began among people ages 45 to 54 in 1999 and continued through 2013, resulting in an increase of 134 deaths per 100,000 people. Congress poured funding into the effort and passed legislation to increase access to treatment. But when it comes to tackling alcohol misuse in middle age, the route for public health strategists has been less clear. Part of the dilemma is that, unlike opioids such as heroin, alcohol is a legal product that studies suggest can contribute to better heart health. Restrictions also can affect people who drink moderately. “There is a concerted effort among folks in the public health industry and in the government to demonize alcohol,” said Sarah Longwell, managing director of the American Beverage Institute, a trade group that represents restaurants. For instance, long-held beliefs about the benefits of moderate drinking are becoming muddled. It cited taxes on alcohol, limiting where alcohol can be sold and how often, and reducing marketing and advertising. Although the purchase of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is illegal, people aged 12–20 years old drink 11% of all alcohol consumed in the US. Among the 14 million adults aged 21 or older who were classified as having alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year, more than 13 million had started using alcohol before age 21. Since 1984, when the National Minimum Drinking Age Act made the minimum legal drinking age for every state in the nation 21, there has been a steady increase in prevalence of alcohol use, heavy use, and frequent use among underage drinkers as the age increases. Across all ages, the highest rates for alcohol abuse occur among persons 19 years old due to illegality of their behavior, and peak alcohol dependence is age 22. In 2013, more than two-thirds of American students had consumed alcohol by the end of high school; and more than half of 12th graders had been drunk at least once in their lifetime. young adults that are affected, people into their sixties struggle with alcoholism. The movement of young adults from high school to college shows that 44% of college students were binge drinkers and that binge drinking peaked at age 21. Approximately three quarters of college students aged 18–20 years old drank alcohol in 2009. The legal drinking age was set to 21 years of age because studies showed that the leading cause of death of people age 1 to 34 accounted for one third of deaths due to unintentional injury from alcohol consumption. Although the minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21 in all states and most territories (see National Minimum Drinking Age Act), the legal details for consumption vary greatly. While a few states completely ban alcohol usage for people under 18, the majority have exceptions that permit consumption. Legally, alcohol intoxication is often defined as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of greater than 5.4–17.4 mmol/L (25–80 mg/dL or 0.025–0.080%).

Despite this, the Federal Government can assess a 10% penalty on highway funds for states which choose to set their drinking age lower than 21. Less than a year after the Supreme Court ruling, all 50 states of the United States officially made 21 the minimum legal drinking age. Motor vehicle accidents decreased after the legal drinking age was raised, but the MLDA-21 is not the only variable which can be identified as a reason for the declining accident rate. Most states decided on the age 21 after prohibition, but the 26th amendment allowed individuals 18 and older to vote and serve in Vietnam, so several states lowered the drinking age as well. However, President Ronald Reagan, who was influenced by groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Remove Intoxicated Drivers (RID), decided to federally enforce a 21+ drinking age by signing the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. He believed that doing so would decrease the number of accidents related to drunk driving, because he said that states with a drinking age of 21+ did not have as many drunk driving accidents. Reagan said that although he wished states would create their 

 legislation to increase the drinking age, a federal law had to be implemented to avoid blood borders, or teenagers driving to the nearest state with a lower drinking age. Reagan threatened states with withholding 5% of federal funding for highways if they did not comply with increasing the drinking age to 21. In 2007, the drinking age debate in the United States was renewed when Choose Responsibility began promoting the lowering of the drinking age coupled with education and rules to persuade people to drink responsibly before they are of legal age. But data suggest that among people who are middle age, another problem involving excess drinking has been quietly brewing. It has been observed only in the U.S. Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who are spouses and Princeton University economists, have found that the trend began among people ages 45 to 54 in 1999 and continued through 2013, resulting in an increase of 134 deaths per 100,000 people. Congress poured funding into the effort and passed legislation to increase access to treatment. But when it comes to tackling alcohol misuse in middle age, the route for public health strategists has been less clear. Part of the dilemma is that, unlike opioids such as heroin, alcohol is a legal product that studies suggest can contribute to better heart health. Restrictions also can affect people who drink moderately. “There is a concerted effort among folks in the public health industry and in the government to demonize alcohol,” said Sarah Longwell, managing director of the American Beverage Institute, a trade group that represents restaurants. For instance, long-held beliefs about the benefits of moderate drinking are becoming muddled. It cited taxes on alcohol, limiting where alcohol can be sold and how often, and reducing marketing and advertising. Although the purchase of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is illegal, people aged 12–20 years old drink 11% of all alcohol consumed in the US. Among the 14 million adults aged 21 or older who were classified as having alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year, more than 13 million had started using alcohol before age 21. Since 1984, when the National Minimum Drinking Age Act made the minimum legal drinking age for every state in the nation 21, there has been a steady increase in prevalence of alcohol use, heavy use, and frequent use among underage drinkers as the age increases. Across all ages, the highest rates for alcohol abuse occur among persons 19 years old due to illegality of their behavior, and peak alcohol dependence is age 22. In 2013, more than two-thirds of American students had consumed alcohol by the end of high school; and more than half of 12th graders had been drunk at least once in their lifetime. young adults that are affected, people into their sixties struggle with alcoholism. The movement of young adults from high school to college shows that 44% of college students were binge drinkers and that binge drinking peaked at age 21. Approximately three quarters of college students aged 18–20 years old drank alcohol in 2009. The legal drinking age was set to 21 years of age because studies showed that the leading cause of death of people age 1 to 34 accounted for one third of deaths due to unintentional injury from alcohol consumption. Although the minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21 in all states and most territories (see National Minimum Drinking Age Act), the legal details for consumption vary greatly. While a few states completely ban alcohol usage for people under 18, the majority have exceptions that permit consumption. Legally, alcohol intoxication is often defined as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of greater than 5.4–17.4 mmol/L (25–80 mg/dL or 0.025–0.080%).

[2024-06-14 14:54:35,850] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every "turn" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2 and provides the chemical energy driving the process. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite 

 In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This citrate molecule undergoes a series of reactions that release carbon dioxide, high-energy electrons, and ATP. The net products of the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), include ATP, NADH, FADH2, and CO2. In the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2. In addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, the citric acid cycle is crucial for the breakdown of fuel molecules, such as glucose and fatty acids, to generate ATP and provide the cell with energy. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism. It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process. There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. During the formation of acetyl-CoA, each pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, resulting in the release of CO2 and the production of NADH, a molecule that carries energy. In summary, ATP is produced through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose, the production of energy-carrying molecules, and the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules in the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver. The three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Overall, these three components work together to convert glucose into ATP, providing the cells with the energy they need to carry out essential functions.

Question: how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:54:35 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: A typical intracellular concentration of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell. In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every "turn" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2 and provides the chemical energy driving the process. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite 

 In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP. It is an important part of cellular respiration, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This citrate molecule undergoes a series of reactions that release carbon dioxide, high-energy electrons, and ATP. The net products of the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), include ATP, NADH, FADH2, and CO2. In the process, two carbons from acetyl CoA are converted to CO2 in subsequent turns of the cycle. The CO2 molecules are released as waste products. The complete oxidation of each acetyl CoA molecule ultimately leads to the generation of two molecules of CO2. In addition to CO2, the citric acid cycle generates energy-rich molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules carry high-energy electrons that are used in the later stages of cellular respiration to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, the citric acid cycle is crucial for the breakdown of fuel molecules, such as glucose and fatty acids, to generate ATP and provide the cell with energy. It is an important part of aerobic respiration and plays a key role in cellular metabolism. It is produced through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrion, an organelle involved in this process. There are four stages of cellular respiration: glycolysis, formation of acetyl-CoA, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. During the formation of acetyl-CoA, each pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, resulting in the release of CO2 and the production of NADH, a molecule that carries energy. In summary, ATP is produced through the process of cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose, the production of energy-carrying molecules, and the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrion. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules in the Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver. The three components of aerobic respiration are glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the addition of 2 ATP molecules and the formation of 2 NADH molecules. After glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for the next component of aerobic respiration, which is the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, pyruvate is further broken down and oxidized, resulting in the production of ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The final component of aerobic respiration is oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

[2024-06-14 14:54:38,768] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are Scyphozoa. As medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. Some species, however, are instead filter feeders, using their tentacles to strain plankton from the water. It occurs above the continental slope but is more common over the deep ocean, seldom occurring at a depth greater than 200 m.

 Apolemia uvaria, commonly known as string jellyfish, barbed wire jellyfish, and long stringy stingy thingy, is a siphonophore in the family Apolemiidae. As with all siphonophores, string jellyfish may appear to be a single organism, but each specimen of Apolemia uvaria is a colony of specialised minute organisms called zooids. String jellyfish are colonial animals that may reach 3 m in total length and have a diameter of 2–5 cm. Carukia barnesi is an extremely venomous jellyfish found near Australia. Stings can result in Irukandji syndrome, and this species is commonly known as Irukandji jellyfish, although this name does not distinguish it from other Irukandji jellyfish such as Malo kingi. A mature C. barnesi's bell is only 12 by in height. The species was discovered by Dr. Jack Barnes of Cairns, Australia, who, while on an exploration mission aimed at determining the reason for Irukandji syndrome, allowed himself to be stung by the jellyfish, while his 14-year-old son and a lifeguard looked on. This species falls

2024-06-14 14:54:38 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Most of the large, often colorful, and conspicuous jellyfish found in coastal waters throughout the world are Scyphozoa. As medusae, they eat a variety of crustaceans and fish, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. Some species, however, are instead filter feeders, using their tentacles to strain plankton from the water. It occurs above the continental slope but is more common over the deep ocean, seldom occurring at a depth greater than 200 m.

 Apolemia uvaria, commonly known as string jellyfish, barbed wire jellyfish, and long stringy stingy thingy, is a siphonophore in the family Apolemiidae. As with all siphonophores, string jellyfish may appear to be a single organism, but each specimen of Apolemia uvaria is a colony of specialised minute organisms called zooids. String jellyfish are colonial animals that may reach 3 m in total length and have a diameter of 2–5 cm. Carukia barnesi is an extremely venomous jellyfish found near Australia. Stings can result in Irukandji syndrome, and this species is commonly known as Irukandji jellyfish, although this name does not distinguish it from other Irukandji jellyfish such as Malo kingi. A mature C. barnesi's bell is only 12 by in height. The species was discovered by Dr. Jack Barnes of Cairns, Australia, who, while on an exploration mission aimed at determining the reason for Irukandji syndrome, allowed himself to be stung by the jellyfish, while his 14-year-old son and a lifeguard looked on. This species falls

Using short, intense "hurricane" bombardments and infiltration tactics, the German armies moved nearly 60 mi to the west, the deepest advance by either side since 1914, but the result was indecisive. The unstoppable advance of the Allied armies during the Hundred Days Offensive of 1918 caused a sudden collapse of the German armies and persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, which, in turn, required the mobilisation of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the Dual Alliance. Anticipating a retaliatory declaration of war from Russia's closest western ally, France, Germany put into action the Schlieffen Plan. Under this military strategy, formulated by Count Schlieffen in 1905, Germany would launch a lightning attack on France through the poorly defended Low Countries. Germany's army would be able to encircle Paris, force France to surrender, and turn its full attention to the Eastern Front. The Germans, led by Paul von Hindenburg, would attack eastward from their front line in western Poland, which had been occupied after the  Battle of Łódź in 1914, toward the Vistula River and also in East Prussia in the vicinity of the  Masurian Lakes (site of the 1914 Battle of the Masurian Lakes).

[2024-06-14 14:54:41,255] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: The lane is a restricted area in which players on offense (in possession of the ball) can stay for only three seconds. At all levels of play, after three seconds the player is assessed a three-second violation which results in a turnover. In American professional basketball, defending team players are prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless the player is directly guarding an offensive player. Otherwise if a defender exceeds that time, the defending team is charged with a defensive three-second violation, which results in a technical foul where the team with the ball is awarded one free throw, plus retaining possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the clock resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane. In 1891, James Naismith's original 13 rules defined a foul as: Only the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws. The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see Penalties below). sanctioned by all three associations, 16 ft wide for both NBA and FIBA keys, and 12 ft for NCAA and NAIA keys. Prior to 2006, the key in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments was a trapezoidal shape. The most-commonly enforced rule on the key is the "three seconds rule" in which the team of a player on offense who stays on the key for more than three seconds loses possession of the ball. Another rule is the lane violation which occurs if a player from either team enters the key before a free-throw shooter releases the ball in the act of shooting. A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player. Line defense is a strategy used in basketball. The line was the first zone concept to be used in basketball. The line defense was the catalyst of the future 3-2 zone defense. In basketball game clock stops when the ball is dead and runs when it is live. Running out the clock was a major problem in the early days of the NBA. The worst example was a 1950 game with a final score of 19-18. Another game the same year had six overtime periods with only a single shot attempted in each. An exception is that a charging foul is usually not called if the ball-handler is within a 4-foot (1.22 m) radius around the center of the basket (known in the rules as the "restricted area" and sometimes colloquially as the "smiley face" ). F52-F58 – other physical impairments. The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds. ; A referee can grant time-outs to either a player or the coach. Rules are governed by standard basketball rules as defined by the NBA, with a few notable exceptions: Games are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league's original

A five-second count will begin if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded or starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. (The five-second count commences when the offensive player penetrates the free throw line extended.) After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession.

In all cases, the clock resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane. In 1891, James Naismith's original 13 rules defined a foul as: Only the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws. The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see Penalties below). sanctioned by all three associations, 16 ft wide for both NBA and FIBA keys, and 12 ft for NCAA and NAIA keys. Prior to 2006, the key in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments was a trapezoidal shape. The most-commonly enforced rule on the key is the "three seconds rule" in which the team of a player on offense who stays on the key for more than three seconds loses possession of the ball. Another rule is the lane violation which occurs if a player from either team enters the key before a free-throw shooter releases the ball in the act of shooting. A recent innovation is the introduction of the restricted area arc directly underneath the basket where the defending player cannot force an offensive foul on the opposing player. Line defense is a strategy used in basketball. The line was the first zone concept to be used in basketball. The line defense was the catalyst of the future 3-2 zone defense. In basketball game clock stops when the ball is dead and runs when it is live. Running out the clock was a major problem in the early days of the NBA. The worst example was a 1950 game with a final score of 19-18. Another game the same year had six overtime periods with only a single shot attempted in each. An exception is that a charging foul is usually not called if the ball-handler is within a 4-foot (1.22 m) radius around the center of the basket (known in the rules as the "restricted area" and sometimes colloquially as the "smiley face" ). F52-F58 – other physical impairments. The amount of time that a team must move the ball across the half-court line went from 10 to 8 seconds. ; A referee can grant time-outs to either a player or the coach. Rules are governed by standard basketball rules as defined by the NBA, with a few notable exceptions: Games are divided into four 10-minute quarters as opposed to the league's original 

 is continued. This count can occur anywhere on the playing court. In the NBA this rule is applied only in a throw in scenario. A five-second count will begin if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded or starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. (The five-second count commences when the offensive player penetrates the free throw line extended.) After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession.

[2024-06-14 14:54:44,387] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: Clevedon Pier is a seaside pier in the town of Clevedon, Somerset, England on the east shore of the Severn Estuary. It was described by Sir John Betjeman, as "the most beautiful pier in England" and was designated a Grade I listed building in 2001. The pier was built during the 1860s to attract tourists and provide a ferry port for rail passengers to South Wales. The pier is 312 m long and consists of eight spans supported by steel rails covered by wooden decking, with a pavilion on the pier head. The pier now offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers. The pier is 312 m long and 48 ft above high water. The supporting piles, which are made of cast iron, are 2 ft in diameter at the seabed. The Severn 

 The pier was officially opened on 29 March 1869, with a parade, bands and a cannon volley by the First Somerset Artillery. Other companies, including 

 During the Victorian era, Clevedon became a popular seaside town, having previously been an agricultural village. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986. Some funds were raised by "sponsored planks" – small brass plaques with names or messages are inlaid on the 

 Yarmouth Pier is a Victorian pleasure pier, located in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. It is the longest wooden pier in England, and frequently requires restoration due to the relatively short lifespan of the wooden piles. Cardiff-based Edwards, Robertson & Co., eventually taken over by Campbells, visited Clevedon Pier. The Toll House on the pier and the adjacent Royal Pier Hotel were both designed by local architect Hans Price. Construction of the pier started at a cost of £10,000, with John William Grover and Richard Ward as the engineers and Hans Price as the architect. The pier projects from the seafront at Clevedon into the Severn Estuary, which separates South West England from South Wales. The pier and toll house, where entry fees are collected, are adjacent to the Royal Pier Hotel, originally known as The Rock House and built in 1823 by Thomas Hollyman. The nearest parking to the pier entrance is on an esplanade above the rocky beach. The present pier, designed by Sir W. Halcrow & Partners, was opened on 19 November 1957 by the Duke of Edinburgh. Constructed predominantly from concrete-clad steel, it is 1026 ft in length and ends in a three-tiered pier-head, featuring a cafe, bar, lounge, and fishing decks. A notice announces that it is the same length as the RMS Titanic, but that ship was over 100 ft shorter. In 2018, the pier underwent restoration at a cost of £500,000, in addition to installing more than 300 m of gas mains supply, as the pier's own gas supply had developed problems. The works coincided with the 60 year anniversary of the pier's official opening.

2024-06-14 14:54:44 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Clevedon Pier is a seaside pier in the town of Clevedon, Somerset, England on the east shore of the Severn Estuary. It was described by Sir John Betjeman, as "the most beautiful pier in England" and was designated a Grade I listed building in 2001. The pier was built during the 1860s to attract tourists and provide a ferry port for rail passengers to South Wales. The pier is 312 m long and consists of eight spans supported by steel rails covered by wooden decking, with a pavilion on the pier head. The pier now offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers. The pier is 312 m long and 48 ft above high water. The supporting piles, which are made of cast iron, are 2 ft in diameter at the seabed. The Severn 

 The pier was officially opened on 29 March 1869, with a parade, bands and a cannon volley by the First Somerset Artillery. Other companies, including 

 During the Victorian era, Clevedon became a popular seaside town, having previously been an agricultural village. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. The pier was dismantled in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for restoration, and reconstructed in 1986. Some funds were raised by "sponsored planks" – small brass plaques with names or messages are inlaid on the 

 Yarmouth Pier is a Victorian pleasure pier, located in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. It is the longest wooden pier in England, and frequently requires restoration due to the relatively short lifespan of the wooden piles. Cardiff-based Edwards, Robertson & Co., eventually taken over by Campbells, visited Clevedon Pier. The Toll House on the pier and the adjacent Royal Pier Hotel were both designed by local architect Hans Price. Construction of the pier started at a cost of £10,000, with John William Grover and Richard Ward as the engineers and Hans Price as the architect. The pier projects from the seafront at Clevedon into the Severn Estuary, which separates South West England from South Wales. The pier and toll house, where entry fees are collected, are adjacent to the Royal Pier Hotel, originally known as The Rock House and built in 1823 by Thomas Hollyman. The nearest parking to the pier entrance is on an esplanade above the rocky beach. The present pier, designed by Sir W. Halcrow & Partners, was opened on 19 November 1957 by the Duke of Edinburgh. Constructed predominantly from concrete-clad steel, it is 1026 ft in length and ends in a three-tiered pier-head, featuring a cafe, bar, lounge, and fishing decks. A notice announces that it is the same length as the RMS Titanic, but that ship was over 100 ft shorter. In 2018, the pier underwent restoration at a cost of £500,000, in addition to installing more than 300 m of gas mains supply, as the pier's own gas supply had developed problems. The works coincided with the 60 year anniversary of the pier's official opening.

However, this union would start to unravel when Jonathan visits Cora in the gazebo and threatens to blackmail her because she hid the truth about the unborn baby and he has become greedy by using her.

 In the years before the first curse, a young bar girl named Cora is swept off her feet by a gentleman named Jonathan, who tells her that he is a prince.

 Regina to be queen. Cora stages the death of Snow White's mother, and manipulates Regina into becoming Snow's stepmother by marrying the girl's father, King Leopold. After killing Regina's true love, Daniel the stable boy, Regina banishes Cora to Wonderland through a looking-glass, where she eventually becomes the Queen of Hearts. The show's spin-off, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, shows that Cora was the Red Queen's tutor in magic whilst in Wonderland; Cora apparently ruled part of the land and was a political rival of the Red King. This interpretation of the Knave was taken by the Evil Queen's curse to Storybrooke, Maine. In this version, the reason that the Evil Queen hates Snow White is that Snow White unwittingly caused the death of Regina's true love, Daniel, a stable boy, by revealing their relationship to Regina's mother, an evil sorceress named Cora, who killed Daniel and forced Regina to marry Snow's father King Leopold. In the Season 3 episode "Witch Hunt" it is revealed that she is the half-sister of Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West.

 stellar backcourt performance earned them a reputation as one of the NCAA's best guard combinations. Kansas marched through the NCAA tournament, beating Midwest Region number one seed Indiana in the Regional Final to advance to the Final Four for the second time in three years. Though Kansas eventually finished at 29–7 with a loss to North Carolina in the Final Four, the team's outstanding performance that year earned the squad a top ten nationwide ranking during the regular season, including a brief time spent at number one. the Wildcats were on their way. On January 29 the Wildcats again traveled to Columbia, this time to defeat Missouri 69 to 53. The Tigers looked game for most of the first half. Milking the clock with crisp ball movement, Missouri was able to crack Kentucky's long and lean front line for easy baskets. Missouri's Keanau Post started it with a rim-rattling dunk a few minutes in, and a pair of dunks 

 Wiggins committed to Kansas on May 14, 2013. On January 13, 2014, Wiggins scored 17 points and collected 19 rebounds in a 77–70 victory over Iowa State, becoming only the second freshman in the last 15 years (along with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist) to amass those numbers in a win against a ranked opponent. In the season prior, Kentucky lost 72 to 67 on this same floor only weeks before their run to the National Championship game. However, the Wildcats turned up the defense to make sure that didn't happen this time after South Carolina's Sindarius Thornwell hit a 3-pointer for a 24 to 23 South Carolina lead with 4:31 left that sent the fans into a frenzy. He also led the team with 4.3 assists per game, 46.8% three-point shooting accuracy, and 97 steals. Chalmers helped his team win the 2008 NCAA Championship with a three-point shot with 2.1 seconds left in the final game. His three just before the end of regulation brought the game into overtime, where Kansas took over and defeated the Memphis Tigers, led by phenom freshman Derrick Rose. It was the Jayhawks' fifth national title (including two pre-tournament titles in 1922 and 1923). Kansas extended its lead to 56–38 with 12:57 left to play before Georgetown closed to a 59–47 deficit halfway through the second half on a Jabril Trawick basket that almost caused a fight between the teams when Trawick fouled Jayhawks small forward Andrew Wiggins hard. A 10–3 Jayhawks run followed that put Kansas ahead 69–50 with 7:10 to play. Georgetown never got within 18 points again as Kansas continued to build its lead. Facing the largest second-half deficit of its so-far perfect season, Kentucky clamped down defensively, ripped off a 14 to 0 run and defeat Georgia 72 to 64. Towns and Aaron Harrison were huge down the stretch, combining for 12 of the 14 points during the decisive run. Towns had seven, including a three-point play with 2:53 left that put Kentucky

The 2020 United States Census reports a population of the state of 29,145,505 on April 1, 2020. Texas is the second-most populous U.S. state, with a 2020 U.S. census resident population of 29,145,505, and apportioned population of 29,183,290. Texas has many major cities and metropolitan areas, along with many towns and rural areas. Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. It represents 

  Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with 52419 sqmi of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States. About three-fifths of the land area is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. Alabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida 

 Texas passed New York State in the 1990s to become the second-largest U.S. state in population, after California. The state is also the most populous state in the South Central United States, and the most populous state in the South. Texas' population growth between 2000 and 2010 represents the highest population increase, by number of people, for any U.S. state during this time period. The large population increase can somewhat be attributed to Texas' relative insulation from the U.S. housing bubble. At the 2020 United States census it was reported that Texas had a resident population of 29,145,505, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 U.S. census. These cities are spread out amongst the state. Texas has 254 counties, which is more than any other state by 95 (Georgia). It originates right outside of the Rocky Mountains and stretches through multiple states with the main portion of it located in Texas. The United States Census Bureau classifies Arkansas as a southern state, sub-categorized among the West South Central States. Arizona is also one of the Four Corners states and is diagonally adjacent to Colorado. Of this area, just 0.32% consists of water, which makes Arizona the state with the second lowest percentage of water area (New Mexico is the lowest at 0.19%). States which encompass the U.S. Rocky Mountains. These are oriented north-south through portions of the states of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico. Arizona and Nevada, as well as other parts of Utah and New Mexico, have other smaller mountain ranges and scattered mountains located in them as well. It is the fastest-growing region in the United States, with Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Colorado, and Arizona ranking among the fastest-growing states in the country.

[2024-06-14 14:54:47,809] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: Perry is depicted as having suicidal thoughts and lying on the floor of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: "[They] are very exact and autobiographical. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me 

 such as "Sick all the time, I miss my wife / I quit / Got better things to do with my life / I quit". Aukerman explained of the song: I can't even count the number of times I've quit this band, dating back to 1982 and Milo Goes to College! Like most of my songs, "I Quit" is my attempt to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! So there is no "message" to the song, just me spewing about the negative aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to quit. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, "I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me." had a song that had a dance to it, they did. And I thought, "Wow, good idea." So I wrote the lyrics as a parody and I wrote it as a joke. If you read the lyrics, they're kind of silly. I'm thinking, you know, here we are, this totally hard thrash band, we kick in your face and rape and murder your wife, and now here we're writing a parody of a '60s or '50s dance number. And then Gary read the lyrics and was, like, "These are brilliant, dude." I'm all, "No way. If we put this on there, they're going to kill us. Are you kidding? They're going to be flipping us off."" About.com commented, "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest to make a former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged the fact that her former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: "There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." For the refrains, she speaks of setting fire to photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn". About.com found the song's theme to be feminism. I'm not sick.I've only had sex with a few guys in my entire life, and none of them were gay or bisexual.I've never done IV drugs, and I'm not promiscuous. ""I honestly don't remember," said Tanya. They said it was not strep throat and that it was likely mono. There were a ton of students on campus with mono that semester." "Tanya, there's no good way to tell you this.

"I'm sorry," Tanya protested, raising both hands, palms out, in front of her. I've only had sex with a few guys in my entire life, and none of them were gay or bisexual. ever written inspired by sitting in the back of a van on tour staring out of the window.

On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one

2024-06-14 14:54:47 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Perry is depicted as having suicidal thoughts and lying on the floor of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: "[They] are very exact and autobiographical. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me 

 such as "Sick all the time, I miss my wife / I quit / Got better things to do with my life / I quit". Aukerman explained of the song: I can't even count the number of times I've quit this band, dating back to 1982 and Milo Goes to College! Like most of my songs, "I Quit" is my attempt to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! So there is no "message" to the song, just me spewing about the negative aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to quit. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, "I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me." had a song that had a dance to it, they did. And I thought, "Wow, good idea." So I wrote the lyrics as a parody and I wrote it as a joke. If you read the lyrics, they're kind of silly. I'm thinking, you know, here we are, this totally hard thrash band, we kick in your face and rape and murder your wife, and now here we're writing a parody of a '60s or '50s dance number. And then Gary read the lyrics and was, like, "These are brilliant, dude." I'm all, "No way. If we put this on there, they're going to kill us. Are you kidding? They're going to be flipping us off."" About.com commented, "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest to make a former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged the fact that her former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: "There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." For the refrains, she speaks of setting fire to photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn". About.com found the song's theme to be feminism. I'm not sick.I've only had sex with a few guys in my entire life, and none of them were gay or bisexual.I've never done IV drugs, and I'm not promiscuous. ""I honestly don't remember," said Tanya. They said it was not strep throat and that it was likely mono. There were a ton of students on campus with mono that semester." "Tanya, there's no good way to tell you this. Tanya's mouth dropped open in disbelief. "Wait a second," interrupted Tanya. This doesn't make any sense to me. And I don't feel bad." "It's great that you appear so healthy otherwise. "I'm sorry," Tanya protested, raising both hands, palms out, in front of her. I've only had sex with a few guys in my entire life, and none of them were gay or bisexual. ever written inspired by sitting in the back of a van on tour staring out of the window. The last song is "Smashed to Pieces in the Still of the Night", they found this written on a wall in Vienna and used it for themselves. They were once driving and all the lights were gone except for the headlamps, whilst a train came past and the driver, apparently, started to descend into madness. The journey goes into the middle of the desert and it ends by your doppelgänger confronting you saying "how long do you mean to be content?." the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one 

 were driving to the studio. They passed a church that said "annual quilt show", which the pair misread as "annual guilt show". Discussing the meaning, Pryor said there was a lot of lyrics referring to "betrayal in one form or another, and guilt seems to go hand-in-hand with betrayal."

 Alice in Wonderland is a 2010 American dark fantasy film directed by Tim Burton from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton. The film stars Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, and Mia Wasikowska, and features the voices of Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, and Timothy Spall. Inspired by Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, and Walt Disney's 1951 animated film of the same name, Alice in Wonderland is a live-action animated film about nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh, who is told that she can restore the White Queen to her throne, with the help of the Mad Hatter. It features the voices of Coco Jack Gillies, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Noah Taylor, Richard Roxburgh, Jacki Weaver, Justine Clarke, The Umbilical Brothers, and Miriam Margolyes. It is an adaptation of the British television sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, created by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French. The film stars Josiane Balasko, Nathalie Baye, Marie Gillain and Claude Gensac. To parallel the role of Lulu in the original series, French singer Chantal Goya appeared as herself. Saunders makes a cameo appearance as a spectator sitting next to Catherine Deneuve at a fashion show. The series features Edina Monsoon, a heavy-drinking, drug-abusing PR agent who spends her time failing to lose weight and chasing bizarre fads in a desperate attempt to stay young and "hip". Edina is joined by magazine fashion director Patsy Stone, whose drug abuse, alcohol consumption and desperate promiscuity far eclipse Edina's. Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter Saffron, a student and aspiring writer whose constant care of her immature mother has left her a bitter cynic. In 2015, she appeared with Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman in the thriller film The Boy Next Door and voiced Fifi, Snoopy's love interest, in The Peanuts Movie. The film is narrated by American actress Marcia Cross and features the song With My Own Two Hands by Ben Harper (brother of) Joel Harper. The film stars voice-overs by actress and activist Amy Smart and Australian musician Xavier Rudd. Tracey Ullman (born Trace Ullman; 30 December 1959) is a British-American actress, comedian, singer, writer, producer, and director. Her earliest mainstream appearances were on British television sketch comedy shows A Kick Up the Eighties (with Rik Mayall and Miriam Margolyes) and Three of a Kind (with Lenny Henry and David Copperfield). She emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States, where she starred in her own network television comedy series, The Tracey Ullman Show, from 1987 until 1990, which also featured the first appearances of the long-running animated media franchise The Simpsons. The film is directed by Craig Gillespie with a screenplay by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara, from a story by Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel, and Steve Zissis.

[2024-06-14 14:54:49,187] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: German grammar is the set of structural rules of the German language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages. Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses. There are three genders and four cases, and verbs are conjugated for person and number. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. German verbs may be classified as either weak, if they form their past tense with a dental consonant inflection, or strong, if they exhibit a vowel gradation (ablaut). Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. However, textbooks often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, and there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak. The German language has several different ways of forming the plural. Many loanwords as well as some dialectal or colloquial nouns, take a plural in s (e.g. das Restaurant → die Restaurants). das Zentrum → die Zentren). Sometimes the stress in the plural form is changed, for example der Muslim → die Muslime. example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely -e for the first-person singular, -st for the informal second-person singular, -t for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and -en for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural. However, some words inherit

2024-06-14 14:54:49 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: German grammar is the set of structural rules of the German language, which in many respects is quite similar to that of the other Germanic languages. Although some features of German grammar, such as the formation of some of the verb forms, resemble those of English, German grammar differs from that of English in that it has, among other things, cases and gender in nouns and a strict verb-second word order in main clauses. There are three genders and four cases, and verbs are conjugated for person and number. Accordingly, German has more inflections than English, and uses more suffixes. German verbs may be classified as either weak, if they form their past tense with a dental consonant inflection, or strong, if they exhibit a vowel gradation (ablaut). Most verbs of both types are regular, though various subgroups and anomalies do arise. However, textbooks often class all strong verbs as irregular. There are more than 200 strong and irregular verbs, and there is a gradual tendency for strong verbs to become weak. The German language has several different ways of forming the plural. Many loanwords as well as some dialectal or colloquial nouns, take a plural in s (e.g. das Restaurant → die Restaurants). das Zentrum → die Zentren). Sometimes the stress in the plural form is changed, for example der Muslim → die Muslime. example, in comparison to the -s added to third-person singular present-tense verbs in English, most German verbs employ four different suffixes for the conjugation of present-tense verbs, namely -e for the first-person singular, -st for the informal second-person singular, -t for the third-person singular and for the informal second-person plural, and -en for the first- and third-person plural, as well as for the formal second-person singular/plural.

Gilmore as Henry Mills, Lana Parrilla as the Evil Queen / Regina Mills and Emilie de Ravin as Belle. De Ravin also confirmed Robert Carlyle's return as Rumpelstiltskin / Mr. Gold, through a photo on her Instagram. On July 1, 2014, it was announced that Scott Michael Foster had been cast as Frozen character Kristoff and Elizabeth Lail as Anna. The show is a reunion for Once Upon a Time creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and one-time-writer Ian B. Goldberg. In February 2016 it was reported that Lost and Once Upon a Time stars Elizabeth Mitchell and Elizabeth Lail would headline the show, initiating another reunion between writers and cast. This episode centers on Regina's (Lana Parrilla) efforts to run Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) out of Storybrooke and reveals how the Evil Queen (Parrilla) unleashed her curse upon the Enchanted Forest. Actress Kristin Bauer van Straten was cast at the last minute and guest starred as the sorceress Maleficent, a character 

 dubbed "The Distinguished Gentleman"), who will be portrayed by Greg Germann. On November 16, it was announced that Bailee Madison would be returning in the same episode to reprise her role as a young Snow White, joined by newcomers Jonathan Whitesell and Kacey Rohl, who will be portraying Hercules and Megara,

[2024-06-14 14:54:54,719] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology, 

 The intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design". Manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources and innovation to impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. “Human beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future. is a staple of sustainable living practices. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice. Lester R. Brown, a prominent environmentalist and founder of the Worldwatch Institute and Earth Policy Institute, describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system." Its practitioners often attempt to reduce their ecological footprint (including their carbon footprint) by altering their methods of transportation, energy consumption and diet. Its proponents aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability, naturally balanced, and respectful of humanity's symbiotic relationship with the Earth's natural ecology. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a bioregional economy. Something which is sustainable will not use more natural resources than the local environment can supply; more financial resources than the local community and markets can sustain; and will have the necessary support from the community, government and other stakeholders to carry on indefinitely. It is one of the key concepts in international development, and is critical in removing dependency on overseas aid. Moreover, technological changes can be perceived as 

 Defined by the United Nations Environment Programme as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," sustainable development may be considered together with the concepts of "integration" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and "interdependence" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent). The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN Earth Summit resulted in the Rio Declaration, Principle 3 of which reads: "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations." Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20). Our Common Future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda; it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue. The report defined 'sustainable development' as "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". One-planet living is a commonly used phrase. The term sustainable development was first coined in the Brundtland report of 1987, defined as the ability to meet the needs of all people in the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. This report defined a turning point in sustainability discourse since it deviated from the earlier limits-to-growth perspective to focus more on achieving social and economic milestones, and their connection to environmental goals, particularly in developing countries. Sustainable development interconnects three socially concerned systems—environment, society and economy—a system seeking to achieve a range of goals

Question: when did the term sustainability start to be used

2024-06-14 14:54:54 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology, 

 The intention of sustainable design is to "eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful, sensitive design". Manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources and innovation to impact the environment minimally, and connect people with the natural environment. “Human beings don't have a pollution problem; they have a design problem. The term “design” is here used to refer to practices applied to the making of products, services, as well as business and innovation strategy — all of which inform sustainability. Sustainability can be thought of as the property of continuance; that is, what is sustainable can be continued into the future. is a staple of sustainable living practices. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice. Lester R. Brown, a prominent environmentalist and founder of the Worldwatch Institute and Earth Policy Institute, describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system." Its practitioners often attempt to reduce their ecological footprint (including their carbon footprint) by altering their methods of transportation, energy consumption and diet. Its proponents aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability, naturally balanced, and respectful of humanity's symbiotic relationship with the Earth's natural ecology. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a bioregional economy. Something which is sustainable will not use more natural resources than the local environment can supply; more financial resources than the local community and markets can sustain; and will have the necessary support from the community, government and other stakeholders to carry on indefinitely. It is one of the key concepts in international development, and is critical in removing dependency on overseas aid. Moreover, technological changes can be perceived as 

 Defined by the United Nations Environment Programme as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," sustainable development may be considered together with the concepts of "integration" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and "interdependence" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent). The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN Earth Summit resulted in the Rio Declaration, Principle 3 of which reads: "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations." Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002), and the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20). Our Common Future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda; it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue. The report defined 'sustainable development' as "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".

There are no reports of CWD from the wild in Britain, but the first European case was diagnosed in a female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) from the Nordfjella population in southern Norway during March 2016. Since then, some 25,000 wild deer in Norway have been tested, 11 of which were found to be infected: seven wild reindeer from the mountains of south-central Norway, three moose (Alces alces) near the Swedish border and a single Red deer.

 Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Kheri has two core areas, Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary, which were merged in 1987. Dudhwa National Park is known as the first National Park of the state after the formation of Uttarakhand and is a national protected area. It is home to many rare and endangered species including tigers, leopards, rhinoceros, hispid hare, elephants, black deer and swamp deer. Dudhwa has approximately 400 species of birds including egrets, cormorants, herons and several species of duck, goose and teal.

The Western Coalfield has been hit much harder by acid rain regulations. Whereas about half of Eastern coal is high in sulfur content, nearly all Western coal falls into this category. In recent years the state government has been seeking to land so called "coal to gas" operations that convert coal into liquid fuels that closely resemble either natural gas or petroleum. in 2006, making Kentucky 3rd in the nation for coal production. The state supplies 10.6% of the country with coal for power plants, giving it the nation's second-largest market share. Arguably coal's biggest economic impact has been low electric rates in Kentucky, which gives the state a competitive advantage in attracting industry, including those with heavy energy demands such as aluminum smelters and automotive plants. Ohio is ranked #7 in the country in overall coal reserves, with 23 billion short tons, 11 billion of which is recoverable. In 2008, the state mined 26 million short tons of coal, ranking #11 in the country in production. The federal government proposed a new rule for regulating coal mining that would attempt to reconcile environmental protection with the reality that the U.S. needs coal for energy. The rule is controlled by a federal agency called the U.S. Office of Surface Mining Reclamation 

 carbon capture is the capture of carbon dioxide from flue gases at power stations (in the case of coal, this coal pollution mitigation is sometimes known as "clean coal"). However, scrubbing is relatively affordable when added to new plants based on coal gasification technology, where it is estimated to raise energy costs for households in the United States using only coal-fired electricity sources from 10 cents per kW·h to 12 cents. Coal's total economic impact is significant, with over 125.96 million tons of coal 

 Only about 40% of coal is produced directly by the company, and 60% comes from subsidiaries. Three-fourths of the company's 60 mines are underground operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2010 Massey Energy had a coal shipment shortfall of 1.4 million tons, half of which was due to rail problems, and the other half a result of misproduction. Electric utilities in Kentucky that use coal "are struggling to stay competitive by converting their power plants to other sources of fuel amid a downturn in the nation's coal industry and in response to stringent environmental regulations," according to Daily Energy Insider. For example, the Louisville Gas & Electric Co. (LG&E) and the Kentucky Utilities Co. (KU) operated a coal-based power plant since 1954 known as Cane Run 7. The project's Lively Grove underground mine was constructed to produce 6 million tons of high sulfur coal per year. By 2001 8.36 billion tons of coal had been extracted from Kentucky, 5.78 billion tons coming from the Eastern Coalfield and 2.58 billion tons coming from the Western Coalfield.

[2024-06-14 14:54:57,825] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: The president and vice president of the United States are formally elected by the Electoral College. The Constitution gives each state the power to appoint its electors "in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct," with all states currently using some form of popular election. The electors are "appointed" at the national election held on Election Day, which occurs "on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November." One early virtue of this wording was that if certain states decided not to participate in the election by failing to appoint any electors, a president could still be elected by a majority of those who were appointed. For example, if there are currently 538 total votes, and all votes from a state that appointed 20 electors are rejected, a 

 Some elections feature an indirect electoral system, whereby there is either no popular vote, or the popular vote is only one stage of the election; in these systems the final vote is usually taken by an electoral college. In the United States, the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the electoral college that in turn elects the President. This can result in a situation where a candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not win the electoral college vote, as most recently happened in 2000 and 2016.

 the U.S. Constitution, the president was chosen by the Electoral College, which consisted of electors selected by each state. Prior to the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes; the individual who received the most electoral votes would become president, while the individual who received the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. If no individual received votes from a majority of the electors, or if two individuals tied for the most votes, then the House of Representatives would select the president in a contingent election. Winners of the popular vote in State elections usually get all of the electoral votes, but there is no legal requirement for a state to use a first-past-the-post system. It was well-known in 1796 that Jefferson and Adams were intended to be elected as president and Burr and Pinckney for Vice President. In a United States presidential election, the popular vote is the total number or the percentage of votes cast for a candidate by voters in the 50 states and Washington, D.C.; the candidate who gains the most votes nationwide is said to have won the popular vote. However, the popular vote is not used to determine who is elected as the nation's president or vice president. Thus it is possible for the winner of the popular vote to end up losing the election, an outcome that has occurred on five occasions, most recently in the 2016 election. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 13, 2004, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body.

In April 1991, during the negotiations between the government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front to end the Salvadoran Civil War, an agreement was reached to reform various articles of the Constitution. One of these reforms was the conversion of the Central Electoral Council into the Supreme Electoral Court, and the addition of the two non-partisan members onto the makeup of the Court. The first challenge the new Court faced was the 1994 Salvadoran general election.

As of that date El Salvador had arrested a total of 2,424 people for violating quarantine orders, and 1,268,090 people had been tested for the virus. Transparency International cited El Salvador and Colombia as examples of an "explosion of irregularities and corruption cases" related to the handling of the pandemic in Latin America.

The Office of the Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights of El Salvador head, Apolonio Tobar, considered the actions taken by the government as "improvised". On March 16, a diplomatic dispute between El Salvador and Mexico developed when President Bukele accused the Mexican government of "being irresponsible" allowing a dozen people with COVID-19 to board a plane bound for El Salvador International Airport. Mexican foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said "all flights to El Salvador, including the one mentioned by the president [Bukele], have been cancelled"; furthermore, Mexican deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell Ramírez denied the charge, and declared that tests showed the individuals in question were virus-free.

Arsenal's 2003–04 season was historic. The Gunners finished the 2003–04 FA Premier League season unbeaten, becoming the first English club to accomplish the feat in the modern era and only the second to ever have an unbeaten season in English football's top tier, the only other team to accomplish this feat being Preston North End in the 1888–89 season. For example, in the title-winning match at local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, Lehmann pushed Tottenham striker Robbie Keane as the pair waited for a Tottenham corner. And Arsenal continued unbeaten until 24 October 2004. In July 2006, they moved into the Emirates Stadium, after 93 years at Highbury.

They hold the highest number of FA Cup trophies, with 14. The club is one of only six clubs to have won the FA Cup twice in succession, in 2002 and 2003, and 2014 and 2015. Arsenal have achieved three League and FA Cup "Doubles" (in 

 Arsenal's first ever silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970–71 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992–93. Seasons in bold are seasons when the club won a Double of the league and FA Cup, or of the FA Cup and League Cup. A special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season. Arsenal Arsenal won the 2003–04 Premier League title, finishing undefeated under manager Arsene Wenger, and went unbeaten for a total of 49 consecutive matches in the league between 2003 and 2004. Their domestic unbeaten run continued into the 2017–18 season and eventually reached 69 games, before they lost 4–0 to Hearts on 17 December 2017. However, the Gunners did stretch their unbeaten run to 49 consecutive matches, an English league football record; the record was equalled with a dramatic 5–3 win over Middlesbrough (Arsenal having trailed 3–1 shortly after half-time) and then surpassed with a 3–0 

 Little did they know it at the time, but the defeat to Leeds would be Arsenal's last in the League for over a year. They became only the second team to do so, the first having been Preston North End in 1888–89. Their rivals for the title gained revenge in other competitions – Arsenal were defeated in the Champions League quarter-finals and FA Cup semi-finals by Chelsea and Manchester United, respectively, in successive matches. Arsenal snatched the last Champions League spot from under the noses of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, after the latter's players went down with a bout of food-poisoning. The Gunners' 4–2 victory

In the human body, the lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments is a pair of ligaments stretching from the lower lateral angles of the sacrum to the transverse processes of the first coccygeal vertebra. the joint between the sacrum and the coccyx. They complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve There are up to three lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments on either side of the sacral hiatus. It also arises from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule and the sacrotuberous ligament). A few fibers also arise from the margin of the greater sciatic foramen, and from the anterior surface of the sacrotuberous ligament. It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. Its tendon often joins with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion. It lies almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. The sacroiliac joints are weight-bearing joints between the articular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, which are located on the lateral surface of the sacrum. There is hyaline cartilage on the sacral side and fibrocartilage on the iliac side. There are no muscles that directly control movement of the sacroiliac joints, but many indirectly affect movement. Sacroiliac joint movement is mainly passive in response to the action of surrounding muscles. The psoas and piriformis muscles pass anterior to the sacroiliac joints, and imbalance of these muscles in particular may affect sacroiliac joint function. Imbalance in the length and strength of the piriformis strongly influences movement of the sacrum. SI Joint Dysfunction occurs when there is an alteration of the structural or positional relationship between the sacrum upon a normally positioned ilium. The sacroiliac joint plays a small but significant role in the cause of low back and buttock pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is a true synovial joint with extensive innervation from the lumbosacral region, accounting for the difficulty differentiating SI Joint Dysfunction from that of surrounding structures. Various medical conditions, such as rheumatologic disorders, infection, and neoplasms, may also affect the joint, and it extremely important for the sports physician to rule out the possibility of sacral stress fracture. SIJ is a diarthrodial joint ( synonial anterior and fibrous posterior ). Age changes begin to occur on the iliac side of the joint as early as the third decade. The joint surface irregularities increase with age and seem to be weight-bearing related. Formed by the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch of the radius, this joint is separated from the radiocarpal joint by an articular disk lying between the radius and the styloid process of the ulna. The capsule of the joint is lax and extends from the inferior sacciform recess to the ulnar shaft. The radiocarpal joint or wrist joint is an 

The pelvic ring is composed of two innominate bones and the sacrum. The innervation to the sacroiliac joints is highly variable and complex. The anterior portion of the sacroiliac joint receives innervation from the posterior rami of the L2-S2 roots, but these contributions are highly variable and may differ in the joints of a given individual. Additional innervation to the anterior joint may arise directly from the obturator nerve, the superior gluteal nerve, and the lumbosacral trunk. The posterior portion of the joint is innervated by the posterior rami of L4-S3. The unique shape of the joint is essential to normal function. Loading is anterior and takes place on a sacral axis at the most posterior part of the S3 sacral segment of the sacroiliac joint. Note the shape at S1 and how it is prone to 'fall away' from the ilial joint surface with ligamentous loading. Primary sacral loading is on the posterior interosseous ligaments. Secondary loading is on the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. Sacral loading increases the lumbar lordosis and the lumbosacral angle. The ilial ridge forces the sacral axis by not allowing any cephalic movement of the sacrum on the innominate bone or any normal or pathological caudad movement of the innominate bone on the sacrum. Posterior rotation of the innominate on the sacrum can only occur with correction when the joint is already in dysfunction. Vleeming described form closure, force closure and self-bracing in the sacroiliac joint, but this can only occur in the unloaded pelvis or in the pelvis of the fresh cadaver. After loading, the line of gravity is anterior to the sacral axis, but posterior to the acetabula causing a posterior pelvic rotation and creating a dynamic, balanced tension on the pelvic ligaments. The sacroiliac joints are vulnerable to injury through minor and major trauma with an anterior shift in the line of gravity causing an anterior rotation of the innominate bones on the sacrum with a reversible subluxation and fixation.

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either too much motion or too little motion. SI joint dysfunction is sometimes referred to as "sacroiliac joint instability" or "sacroiliac joint insufficiency" due to the support the once strong and taut ligaments can no longer sustain. The sacroiliac joint itself often will not show degenerative changes, such as arthritis, until many years of the dysfunction being allowed to continue. Injury to the ligaments that hold the sacroiliac joints in proper support is thought to be caused by a torsion or high impact injury (such as an automobile accident) or a hard fall, resulting in the hypermobility. This is thought to result in the ilium and sacral surfaces "locking" in an incongruent or asymmetrical fashion (one innominate bone is tilted anteriorly; the other innominate bone is tilted posteriorly) causing pain that can be debilitating. Pelvic joint pain in post pregnancy women is thought to be derived from the inability of the stretched out ligaments to return to normal tautness.

 "Ashes" is a song recorded by Canadian singer Celine Dion for the soundtrack of the 2018 American superhero film Deadpool 2, which is based on the Marvel Comics character Deadpool and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Director David Leitch wanted to create an original song for Deadpool 2 that could support the emotional core of the film, with "Ashes" being the song that was ultimately written. The song is meant to balance a satire of similar songs in other films with its role as the 

 Leitch and music supervisor John Houlihan began meeting with songwriters to discuss the song, with Leitch focusing on conveying his thematic ideas. They "ended up discovering" this song "Ashes" as written by Petey Martin, Jordan Smith, and Tedd T. Leitch felt it "just sort of fit and ticked all the boxes of what I was trying to do, story-wise". Leitch then discussed with actor/producer Ryan Reynolds his wish to find a "contemporary artist who's got the chops to make it super emotional" for recording the song. Reynolds approached Dion about this, and Leitch said that she agreed to join the project not only because her son is a fan of Deadpool but also because she was "taken aback by the song" and understood what they wanted to do with it. Leitch admitted that the song was satirical but also felt that having Dion record it elevated it to play as a more emotional cornerstone of the film as well. The song played over the end credits is "My Rifle, My Pony and Me" by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson, from the 1959 Western Rio Bravo. Tony is seen watching this movie (and specifically, the scene in which the song appears) in the Season Four premiere, "For All Debts Public and Private". ; The song heard from A.J. 's room when Tony is in bed is "The Gift That Keeps On Giving" by Deicide from their album Insineratehymn. ; Snake River Conspiracy's cover of The Cure's "Lovesong" plays in the Crazy Horse club. ; The song played when Bobby goes into Dorley's Lounge to speak with Teddy about the union vote is "Theme for an Imaginary Western" by Mountain. ; The song playing in the Crazy Horse club when Adrianna walks in on Tony and Ralph in her office is "Can't Stand It" by The Greenhornes. To Harris, this link helps define the journey undertaken in The Band, from the "idealism" of "Across the Great Divide" to "stark reality" of "King Harvest." The soundtrack is primarily composed by Kojima Productions' Kazuma Jinnouchi and Nobuko Toda, with Akihiro Honda providing the orchestral theme and the theme songs, "Heavens Divide" (performed in English by Australian singer and actress Donna Burke) and "Koi no Yokushiryoku (Love Deterrence)" (performed in Japanese by singer-songwriter Nana Mizuki, Paz's Japanese voice actress). The game also features music from other Metal Gear Solid games, such as Portable Opss "Calling to The Night", which can be played in the game's Walkmans. The game's credit music features a faithful cover version of the Carpenters' 1973 performance of "Sing" sung by Japanese-American vocalist and musician Cindy Asada. In the context of the game, the song appears on a taped recording and is sung by the Boss AI as Peace Walker sinks under Lake Cocibolca. As part of this, Leitch wanted to create an original song for the film that thematically represented these personal stakes and served as an emotional through-line for many of the characters in the film in the vein of "Take My Breath Away" and "My Heart Will Go On"; it plays over the film's James Bond-style opening credits. She called the stern sense of loss Cohen voiced, in the song, "a touch disproportionate", given his long history of finding lovers who were already in relationships with other men. Despite being performed in a major key, the ballad compensates by using "vocals, slowness, and mirroring the haunting theme" of the score. Variety's Jerome Weeks wrote that the song "combines a lovely descending-line melody with one of Rice’s most touching efforts in the way the Beast haltingly, almost inarticulately grapples with his developing love." Thomas S. Hischak, author of The Disney Song Encyclopedia, observed that the track boasts "a resounding, operatic tone that is far heavier" than the film's original songs.

At the combine, reports of Holliday's 40-yard dash time ranged from between 4.18 seconds and 4.34 seconds. Adam Schefter, an ESPN reporter on hand at the event, had reported on Twitter that NFL scouts had clocked Holliday in as low as 4.21 during the workout. He demonstrated his sprinting ability in the 100-meter dash at the 2007 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, where he recorded 10.07 seconds in the final – ahead of Walter Dix and second only to Tyson Gay. He continued to race, however, and reached the semi-finals in the 100 m at the 2008 

  At 5'5" (1.65 m), Holliday is the shortest player to play in the NFL in the last 25 years. Holliday had a difficult time getting started in football.

He became the third fastest NFL player to reach 10,000 yards. He also set a team record 

 At the 2005 NFL Scouting Combine, Routt ran the fastest 40-yard dash at a time of 4.27 seconds, the fastest time since the NFL used electronic timing. His record was broken by running back Chris Johnson with a time of 4.24 seconds in 2008. At the 2015 NFL Scouting Combine, Nelson had the fastest 40-yard dash with a time of 4.28 seconds, .04 seconds shy of the then-combine record of 4.24 seconds held then by Chris Johnson. Nelson was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the fifth round, 159th overall, of the 2015 NFL Draft. He finished his rookie year with 11 receptions for 299 yards and two touchdowns. He also had the second-best time in both the three-cone drill (7.33) and 20-yard shuttle (4.47). He performed 30 repetitions at 225 lb in the bench press, tied for fifth-best among offensive linemen.

Question: who ran the fastest 40 yard dash in the nfl
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:55:04 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Holliday had self-reported running times as fast as 4.21, which seemed plausible given his extensive track background, and the fastest 100 m dash time of any football player in NCAA history. At the combine, reports of Holliday's 40-yard dash time ranged from between 4.18 seconds and 4.34 seconds. Adam Schefter, an ESPN reporter on hand at the event, had reported on Twitter that NFL scouts had clocked Holliday in as low as 4.21 during the workout. He demonstrated his sprinting ability in the 100-meter dash at the 2007 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, where he recorded 10.07 seconds in the final – ahead of Walter Dix and second only to Tyson Gay. He continued to race, however, and reached the semi-finals in the 100 m at the 2008 

  At 5'5" (1.65 m), Holliday is the shortest player to play in the NFL in the last 25 years. Holliday had a difficult time getting started in football. Fearing that college recruiters would not believe Holliday's actual running times, his high school coaches added to his recorded times before sending them in. ; With his 211–yard rushing effort against the Chicago Bears, Adrian Peterson of the Vikings breached the 10,000–yard mark for his career. He became the third fastest NFL player to reach 10,000 yards. He also set a team record 

 At the 2005 NFL Scouting Combine, Routt ran the fastest 40-yard dash at a time of 4.27 seconds, the fastest time since the NFL used electronic timing. His record was broken by running back Chris Johnson with a time of 4.24 seconds in 2008. At the 2015 NFL Scouting Combine, Nelson had the fastest 40-yard dash with a time of 4.28 seconds, .04 seconds shy of the then-combine record of 4.24 seconds held then by Chris Johnson. Nelson was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the fifth round, 159th overall, of the 2015 NFL Draft. He finished his rookie year with 11 receptions for 299 yards and two touchdowns. He also had the second-best time in both the three-cone drill (7.33) and 20-yard shuttle (4.47). He performed 30 repetitions at 225 lb in the bench press, tied for fifth-best among offensive linemen.

The presence of water in magma reduces the melting temperature, which may also play a role in enhancing Icelandic volcanism. The Iceland hotspot is a hotspot which is partly responsible for the high volcanic activity which has formed the Iceland Plateau and the island of Iceland.

About a third of the basaltic lavas erupted in recorded history have been produced by Icelandic eruptions. In this framework, the volcanism of Iceland is attributed to this plume, according to the theory of W. Jason Morgan.

[2024-06-14 14:55:09,287] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: A recently begun Cornell tradition is the New Student Reading Project, sometimes called the Freshmen Reading Project. Begun for the Class of 2005, all incoming freshmen and transfer students were required to read a book chosen by the university. Alumni and faculty were also encouraged to read the book. When students arrived, they participated in discussion groups and other activities related to the book. For example, in the fall of 2005, Chinua Achebe came to Cornell and discussed his Things Fall Apart ('09). Students with reading deficits often use various methods and tools to help them review material and improve their reading skills. Some commonly used methods and tools include tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers. Tape recorders are beneficial for students with reading deficits as they allow for the recording of lectures or class discussions. By using tape recorders, students can focus on understanding the content without the pressure of keeping up with the reading or taking notes simultaneously. Tutorial aids are another helpful resource for students with reading deficits. These aids can include visual aids, such as charts, diagrams, or illustrations, that help visualize and simplify complex information. These aids serve as valuable supplements to the reading material and facilitate comprehension for students with reading difficulties. Laptop computers are also commonly used by students with reading deficits. These technological tools provide alternative ways for students to engage with and process information. It is important to note that the Orton phonologic method has been widely used for individuals with reading deficits. In conclusion, students with reading deficits utilize various methods and tools such as tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers to review material and improve their reading skills. These resources offer alternative ways to access and understand information, catering to individual needs and enhancing learning outcomes. While Cornell students are no stranger to such activities as streaking, screaming before finals, or flash mobs, other impromptu activities are more specific to Cornell and its unique terrain: Traying down Libe Slope: After a fresh snowfall, undergraduates have been known to smuggle trays from the dining options in Willard Straight Hall or from the dormitory dining halls and use them to sled down Cornell's dramatic Libe Slope, a 100-foot hill stretching from Cornell West Campus to Uris Library, the undergraduate home of the Cornell University Library. The Didactic method, also known as the lecture method, is a teaching approach where the instructor plays a central role in delivering information to students. However, it is important to note that the Didactic method can still involve active learning strategies alongside the lecture component.

It is worth highlighting that while the Didactic method is mainly focused on information transmission from the instructor to the students, it does not imply that all passive learning is encouraged. Educators can employ various strategies to make the Didactic method more interactive and promote active engagement among students.

2024-06-14 14:55:09 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: A recently begun Cornell tradition is the New Student Reading Project, sometimes called the Freshmen Reading Project. Begun for the Class of 2005, all incoming freshmen and transfer students were required to read a book chosen by the university. Alumni and faculty were also encouraged to read the book. When students arrived, they participated in discussion groups and other activities related to the book. For example, in the fall of 2005, Chinua Achebe came to Cornell and discussed his Things Fall Apart ('09). Students with reading deficits often use various methods and tools to help them review material and improve their reading skills. Some commonly used methods and tools include tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers. Tape recorders are beneficial for students with reading deficits as they allow for the recording of lectures or class discussions. By using tape recorders, students can focus on understanding the content without the pressure of keeping up with the reading or taking notes simultaneously. Tutorial aids are another helpful resource for students with reading deficits. These aids can include visual aids, such as charts, diagrams, or illustrations, that help visualize and simplify complex information. These aids serve as valuable supplements to the reading material and facilitate comprehension for students with reading difficulties. Laptop computers are also commonly used by students with reading deficits. These technological tools provide alternative ways for students to engage with and process information. It is important to note that the Orton phonologic method has been widely used for individuals with reading deficits. In conclusion, students with reading deficits utilize various methods and tools such as tape recorders, tutorial aids, and laptop computers to review material and improve their reading skills. These resources offer alternative ways to access and understand information, catering to individual needs and enhancing learning outcomes.

While she was most famous for her books, Brown also wrote poems for children ("Goddesses", "The Return", "Clappers", "The Christ Clappers") and music for kindergarten marching plays. Her poems were featured in children's textbooks for school. She wrote "The Little Drummer Boy" (originally titled "The Carol of the Drum"), in 1941. A manuscript of Mary Hazzard of the New Lebanon, New York, Shaker community records this original version of the melody: The song resembles, to a slight extent, several repetitions of the opening measures of William Byrd's renaissance composition, "The Barley Break", which Byrd intended to imitate country children playing a folk game. 2, by Giovanni Gabrieli (c.1555-1612).

It was set to music by Vaughan Williams in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs, although he described it as "that horrible little lamb – a poem that I hate". It was also given a setting by Sir John Tavener, who explained: "The Lamb came to me fully grown and was written in an afternoon and dedicated to my nephew Simon for his 3rd birthday."

Localization, the process of manufacturing products for the local market, is an approach to keeping some manufacturing offshore and bringing some of it back. Besides the cost savings of manufacturing closer to the market, the lead time for adapting to changes in the market is faster. The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output. A 2012 series of articles in Atlantic Magazine   highlighted a turning of the tide for parts of the USA's manufacturing industry. Specific causes identified include rising third-world wages, recognition of hidden off-shoring costs, innovations in design/manufacture/assembly/time-to-market, increasing fuel and transportation costs, falling energy costs in the US, increasing US labor productivity, and union flexibility. To those who are concerned that nations may be losing a net number of jobs due to outsourcing, some point out that insourcing also occurs. A 2004 study in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other industrialized countries more jobs are insourced than outsourced. The New York Times disagreed, and wrote that free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages. In 2010, a group of manufacturers started the Reshoring Initiative, focusing on bringing manufacturing jobs for American companies back to the country. Their data indicated that 140,000 American jobs were lost in 2003 due to offshoring. More than 90% of the jobs that American companies "offshored" and outsourced manufacturing to low cost countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam did not return. Companies such as ET Water Systems (now a Jain Irrigation Systems company), GE Appliances and Caterpillar found that with the increase of labor costs in Japan and China, the cost of shipping and custom fees, it cost only about 10% more to manufacture in America. Advances in technology and automation such as 3D printing technologies have made bringing manufacturing back to the United States, both cost effective and possible. Adidas, for example, plans producing highly customized shoes with 3D printers in the U.S.

 Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process. The tradeoffs are not always balanced, and a 2004 viewer of the situation said "the total number of jobs realized in the United States from insourcing is far less than those lost through outsourcing." Most of the manufacturers are WHO prequalified for such supplies. The market remains small (currently accounts for less than 2 per cent of the global market) and underpenetrated compared to the developed countries. When these changes are not well synronized, unemployment or underemployment is a likely result. By contrast, higher rates of saving and investment in Asian countries, along with rising levels of education, studies suggest, fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. New factories often: Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. While U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce high top level executive or managerial costs, they primarily outsource to reduce peripheral and "non-core" business expenses. Further reasons are higher taxes, high energy costs, and excessive government regulation or mandates. Other reasons include reducing and controlling operating costs, improving company focus, gaining access to world-class capabilities, tax credits, freeing internal resources for other purposes, streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions, and maximizing use of external resources. For small businesses, contracting/subcontracting/"outsourcing" might be done to improve work-life balance

A problem with this argument, however, is the context of Galatians 5. Galatians 5:4 in particular, says, "You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace." Line this up with Galatians 2, Galatians 2:21 in particular, which says "I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ 

 up threatening". Peter was aware that there were masters that were gentle and masters that were harsh; slaves in the latter situation were to make sure that their behaviour was beyond reproach, and if punished for doing right, to endure the suffering as Christ also endured it. The key theological text is Paul's declaration in Epistle to the Galatians (Galatians 3:28): "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus", suggesting that Christians 

 a grace given by God, and people are justified by God through Jesus Christ and faith in Him. According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul's writings on Jesus' role, and salvation by faith, is not the individual conscience of human sinners, and their doubts about being chosen by God or not, but the problem of the inclusion of Gentile (Greek) Torah observers into God's covenant. A similar challenge is presented by Galatians 2:15 and 16, just after the Incident at Antioch, in which Paul says (speaking to Peter, a fellow Jew), "We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified." Wright notes the apparent discrepancy between Romans and Galatians, the former being much more positive about the continuing covenantal relationship between God and his ancient people than the latter. Wright contends therefore that works are not insignificant. According to Wright, Paul distinguishes between works which are signs of ethnic identity, and those which are a sign of obedience to Christ. So what does any of this lecture on cell biology have to do with the gospel? Paul warns us about exactly this in Galatians 1. So what was this potentially cancerous error that the Galatians were being taught? And what is the true gospel we should cling to instead? It would seem there were teachers Galatia telling the new believers that in order to be saved they had to follow the Jewish laws, including the practice of circumcision. Paul makes clear in his letter to the Ephesians all that is required for salvation – it is by grace alone, through faith alone. Jesus handled

 Sometime in AD 48–55, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to the Galatians in Greek, the medium of communication in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire. This may mean that Galatians at the time were already bilingual in Greek, as St. Jerome later reports. However, scholars are divided as to whether Paul was writing to Greek Galatians or to the Hellenized descendants of the Celtic Galatians. The Epistle to the Galatians says that, prior to his conversion, Paul was a Pharisee who "violently persecuted" the followers of Jesus. "You have heard, no doubt, of my earlier life in Judaism. I was violently persecuting the church of God and was trying to destroy it. The Epistle to the Galatians, often shortened to Galatians, is the ninth book of the New Testament.

[2024-06-14 14:55:15,742] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Aeschylus' work has a strong moral and religious emphasis. Aeschylus' popularity is evident in the praise that the comic playwright Aristophanes gives him in The Frogs, produced some 50 years after Aeschylus' death. Aeschylus appears as a character in the play and claims, at line 1022, that his Seven against Thebes "made everyone watching it to love being warlike". Aeschylus goes on to say, at lines 1039ff., that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous. Another theme, with which Aeschylus' would continually involve himself, makes its first known appearance in this play, namely that the polis was a key development of human civilization. The play tells the story of Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of the shamed king of Thebes, Oedipus. But a new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices, and Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict. Aeschylus (, ; Aiskhylos, ; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an ancient Greek tragedian, and is often described as the father of tragedy. There is a long-standing debate regarding the authorship of one of them, Prometheus Bound, with some scholars arguing that it may be the work of his son Euphorion. He says that "In the Oedipus, for example, it is hard to name any stock character except the messenger." In 2008, translator Frederick Ahl wrote that in comparison with Sophocles's Oedipus the King, Seneca's version of the myth "is today among the least commonly read of ancient tragedies, largely because the scholarly world regards it as a dull and vastly inferior work". His Oresteia is the only extant ancient example. (about two generations before Troy) The story of Oedipus is the basis of a trilogy of plays by Sophocles, however, similar stories have been traced to cultures all over the world. In the Œdipus Tyrannus Sophocles's hero becomes gradually aware of the terrible fact that, however hard his family has tried to avert the oracular prophecy, he has nevertheless killed his father and married his mother and must now pay the penalty for these unwitting crimes. The same awareness of a cruel fate that leads innocent men and women into sin and demands retribution of the equally innocent children, pervades La Thébaïde, a play that itself deals with the legend of Œdipus. Many authors consider the western literary tradition to have begun with the epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, which remain giants in the literary canon for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred. Notable among later Greek poets was Sappho, who defined, in many ways, lyric poetry as a genre. A playwright named Aeschylus changed Western literature forever when he introduced the ideas of dialogue and interacting characters to playwriting. In doing so, he essentially invented "drama": his Oresteia trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were Sophocles and Euripides. Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing irony as a literary technique, most famously in his play Oedipus Rex. Examples include the final section (lines 908-1077) of Aeschylus' The Persians (472 BCE) in which Xerxes laments the defeat of his Persian army, the final appearance of Antigone in Sophocles' Antigone (c.442 BCE), the interaction between the chorus and Oedipus when he returns having blinded himself in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex (c.429 BCE), and the exchange between Orestes, Electra and the chorus immediately after Clytemnestra's murder in Euripides' Electra (c.410 BCE).

Barry later travels back in time to season one's timeframe to obtain Thawne's help with tachyon equipment. In season three, Barry saves Nora from Thawne's true form who is locked up in a prison.

After being exposed and later captured by Barry with help from Oliver Queen, Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, Thawne offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save the Allen family in exchange for a time machine to return to the 22nd century. Barry ultimately refuses and destroys Thawne's machine. He was unable to alter Barry's transformation into the Flash, however, as that would effectively erase himself from existence. Instead, Thawne decides to ruin Barry's life during the latter's childhood, killing his mother, Nora. Thawne later reveals that the Flashpoint timeline was created when Barry went back in time to stop the Reverse-Flash from killing Nora. Recreating a rope climbing trick, the Flash begins vibrating his molecules when he suddenly disappears from the stage. The Post-Crisis extended origin storyline "The Return of Barry Allen" revealed that Thawne was once a scientist obsessed with the Flash, even undergoing cosmetic surgery to resemble his hero. As a result, the unstable Thawne convinced himself that he was Barry and subsequently attacked Central City for "forgetting him". Eobard Thawne found a time capsule in the 25th century containing a costume of the Flash (Barry Allen) and with a Tachyon device amplified the suit's speed energy, giving himself speedster abilities. Blaming the Flash for his defeat, Thawne became obsessed with "replacing" Barry and traveled back in time to exact his revenge. When Iris West (Barry's wife) rejected his romantic pursuits, Thawne killed Iris. After Flash had found love again, Thawne threatened to kill Fiona Webb (Barry's new fiancé) on their wedding day. Fearful that history was repeating itself, Barry killed Thawne by breaking his neck. It was Thawne's suggestion that Nora help Barry with DeVoe's crashing satellite, and the pair routinely keep in touch through Nora's journal.

Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories. Cheaper and more widely used was toning: dying the film in a single color, used in many films in the 1920s. It was a complex, time consuming, and expensive process that many movie studios were not eager to try. One of the early adopters of the three-strip process was Disney. Some of the most notable films Technicolor processed with three-strip were The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. A simplified two-color version, introduced as Kinemacolor in 1908, was marginally successful for a few years, but the special projector it required and its inherent major technical defects contributed to its demise in 1914. Technicolor, originally also a two-color process capable of only a limited range of hues, was commercialized in 1922 and soon became the most widely used of the several two-color processes available in the 1920s. Beginning in 1932, Technicolor introduced a new full-color process, "Process 4", now commonly called "three-strip Technicolor" because the special camera used for live-action filming yielded separate black-and-white negatives for each of the three primary colors. all-color feature in "New Technicolor" was Becky Sharp (1935). The proliferation of television in the early 1950s contributed to a heavy mid-century push for color within the film industry. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. The color boom was aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near-monopoly on the medium. However, the company was not a success, partly due to the expense of installing the special Kinemacolor projectors. It differed from Kinemacolor only in that the need for a filter-equipped projector was eliminated by staining alternate frames of the film itself with red and green dyes.

Cortical interneurons only make up around a fifth of the 

 Brain cells make up the functional tissue of the brain. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Neurons are often grouped into a cluster known as a nucleus where they usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. In the human brain the brainstem is composed of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain. These pathways include the corticospinal tract (motor function), the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation, and proprioception), and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch, and crude touch). The functional components of a neuron include the cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. The processes extending from the cell body, such as the axon and dendrites, are responsible for transmitting information. Dendrites, on the other hand, receive incoming signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. They connect the axon of one neuron to the dendrites or cell body of another neuron, forming synapses. Neurons transmit different types of information to the brain. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors (found in the skin, eyes, ears, etc.) Interneurons, also known as intercalated neurons, form a network within the central nervous system, allowing for communication and integration between sensory and motor neurons. In summary, neurons are composed of a cell body, axon, dendrites, and synaptic junctions. They transmit information through electrical signals along the axon, receive signals through dendrites, and communicate with other neurons through synapses. This intricate system facilitates the transmission of various types of information, including sensory input and motor output, ultimately allowing for the functioning of the nervous system. There are several types of nerve cells, also known as neurons, in the human body, each with its specific functions. Some of the main types include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory Neurons: These neurons are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain. They gather information from various sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, skin, and nose, and transmit it to the central nervous system for processing. Examples of sensory neurons include those involved in vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Motor Neurons: Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands, allowing for voluntary and involuntary movements and controlling bodily functions. Interneurons: Interneurons, also known as association neurons, form connections between sensory and motor neurons. These are just a few examples of nerve cell types and their general functions. However, it's important to note that the nervous system is incredibly complex, and there are many more specialized types of neurons with unique roles and functions in different areas of the body. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, 

 The cerebellum (Latin for "little brain") is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. Neurons play a crucial role in these functions by transmitting electrical signals and information throughout the brain. Neurons are specialized cells that receive and transmit information. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, which are specialized connections between neurons. Neurons also form networks and systems within the brain. Overall, neurons are vital for the functioning of the brain.

Sensory Neurons: These neurons are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain. They gather information from various sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, skin, and nose, and transmit it to the central nervous system for processing. Examples of sensory neurons include those involved in vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Motor Neurons: Motor neurons transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands, allowing for voluntary and involuntary movements and controlling bodily functions. Interneurons: Interneurons, also known as association neurons, form connections between sensory and motor neurons. These are just a few examples of nerve cell types and their general functions. However, it's important to note that the nervous system is incredibly complex, and there are many more specialized types of neurons with unique roles and functions in different areas of the body. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them). Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, 

 The cerebellum (Latin for "little brain") is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. Neurons play a crucial role in these functions by transmitting electrical signals and information throughout the brain. Neurons are specialized cells that receive and transmit information. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, which are specialized connections between neurons. Neurons also form networks and systems within the brain. Overall, neurons are vital for the functioning of the brain.

Until 1964, the Golden Gate Bridge had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 ft. Since 1964 its main span length has been surpassed by seventeen bridges; it now has the second-longest main span in the Americas, after the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. The total length of the Golden Gate Bridge from abutment to abutment is 8,981 ft. The Golden Gate Bridge's clearance above high water averages 220 ft while its towers, at 746 ft above the water, were the world's tallest on a suspension bridge until 1993 when it was surpassed by the Mezcala Bridge, in Mexico.

Since the early 1980s, many direct tax subsidies to the USPS (with the exception of subsidies for costs associated with disabled and overseas voters) have been reduced or eliminated. The USPS has a monopoly on "letter" delivery within the United States and operates under a universal service obligation (USO), both of which are defined across a broad set of legal mandates, which obligate it to provide uniform price and quality across the entirety of its service area. The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked "U.S. Mail" and personal letterboxes in the United States, but has to compete against private package delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, FedEx, and Amazon. Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years.

As do the Post Office departments in many countries, the United States Postal Service has a legal monopoly on delivery of non-overnight letters. In many cities bus service enjoys a legal monopoly, however some city governments have legalized bus competition due to pressure from consumers who desire lower prices and entrepreneurs that would like to provide them.

The Post Office has exclusive access to letter boxes marked "U.S. Mail" and personal letterboxes in the United States, but has to compete against private package delivery services, such as United Parcel Service, FedEx, and Amazon. Proponents of universal service principles claim that since any obligation must be matched by the financial capability to meet that obligation, the postal monopoly was put in place as a funding mechanism for the USO, and it has been in place for over a hundred years. It is one of the few government agencies explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. It was elevated to a cabinet-level department 

 divested local companies continued to be protected in lesser degree from competition in the local exchange market as a public utility. National Postal, telegraph and telephone service monopolies were enforced in many countries until the late 20th century. Telstra, for example, had a legal monopoly on telecommunications in Australia. As do the Post Office departments in many countries, the United States Postal Service has a legal monopoly on delivery of non-overnight letters. In many cities bus service enjoys a legal monopoly, however some city governments have legalized bus competition due to pressure from consumers who desire lower prices and entrepreneurs that would like to provide them. It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.

The song was released as the lead single from the band's second studio album Mean Everything to Nothing. Until 2017, "I've Got Friends" was Manchester Orchestra's only top-10 chart success and their highest-charting song; this feat was bested by "The Gold", which reached No. "I've Got Friends" was used in multiple video game soundtracks, such as MLB 11: The Show and Dirt 3, as well as in the television show The Vampire Diaries. The song was a number one hit on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts published by RPM, reaching its peak on both charts for the week of December 31, 1977. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: "Lady" in 1980 and "You Were a Good Friend" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor. Through the years the song has been covered by numerous other artists, including Tammy Wynette, Dottie West, Billie Jo Spears, Waylon Jennings, Anne Murray, Johnny Hallyday and Millie Jackson. "Friends in Low Places" first entered the Hot Country Songs on August 18, 1990. 1, where it remained there for four weeks until it was knocked off by "You Lie" performed by Reba McEntire. By then, the song was already causing a stir. Brooks told a reporter from USA Today in October 1990, when the song was still at its chart peak, that he had received letters from high school students saying that they wanted to use "Friends in Low Places" as their "class song," only to have it opposed by their principals because the song is about

 "Daytime Friends" is a song written by Ben Peters and recorded by American country music artist Kenny Rogers. The song was Rogers' second number one country hit as a solo artist. The single's B-side, "We Don't Make Love Anymore," was composed by Rogers and Marianne Gordon and later covered by Anne Murray and was released on her album Let's Keep It That Way. Schlitz' first hit as a songwriter was Kenny Rogers's "The Gambler", which became a crossover country hit upon its release in 1978, later becoming one of Rogers's signature songs. Among his biggest hits are two Number One songs which he co-wrote with Paul Overstreet, "Forever and Ever, Amen" by Randy Travis and "When You Say Nothing at All" by Keith Whitley. 3 country hit for Randy Travis in 1991. Rogers also recorded several more of his songs in 2013 for his best-selling You Can't Make Old Friends album. "Getting to Know You" is a show tune from the 1951 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I. It was first sung by Gertrude Lawrence in the original Broadway production and later by Marni Nixon who dubbed for Deborah Kerr in the 1956 film adaptation. In this case the melody was a tune he wrote for South Pacific, called "Suddenly Hungry and Sad", which he originally intended for the character of Nellie to sing but replaced it with the song "(I'm in Love with) a Wonderful Guy". "Fair-weather Friends" was released by its co-writer, Johnny Cash in 1982 on his album, The Adventures of Johnny Cash. "Years from now" was previously recorded by Bobbi Humphrey in 1977 and would later be made famous by Dr. Hook. The duet with Emmylou Harris, "If I Needed You", was first recorded by Townes Van Zandt on his 1972 album, The Late Great Townes Van Zandt. as a solo during a breast-cancer care show. Her solo version was an acoustic ballad with several lyrics changed, such as "you've gotta get with my friends" being changed to "you've gotta be my best friend". In 2016, American actress Eva Longoria performed a comedic dramatic reading of "Wannabe" in honour of the 20th anniversary of the album Spice. For the 21st anniversary of the song in July 2017, W magazine had various celebrities perform "Wannabe", including Nicole Kidman, James Franco, Riz Ahmed, Milo Ventimiglia, Millie Bobby Brown and Keri Russell. In addition to the title song for 9to5, she also recorded a second version of "I Will Always Love You" for The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982). "I Will Always Love You" has been covered by many country artists, including Ronstadt on Prisoner In Disguise (1975), Kenny Rogers on Vote for Love (1996), and LeAnn Rimes on Unchained Melody: The Early Years (1997).

 Edible plant stems are one part of plants that are eaten by humans. Plant stems have a variety of functions. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. Apical meristems, located at the shoot tip and axillary buds on the stem, allow plants to increase in length, surface, and mass. In some plants, such as cactus, stems are specialized for photosynthesis and water storage. The pattern of stem growth in Lepidodendrales can be reconstructed by analyzing their cortical growth patterns. When plants are immature, the cortex is extensive and the outer stem surface is covered with many rows of leaf bases. As the tree continues to grow, the secondary xylem and periderm originate from the vascular cambium and phellogen. This increase in stem tissue and stem diameter results in the sloughing off of outer tissues including leaf bases; hence, in older areas of the plant the outer surface of the trunk is protected by the periderm.

The integration of fixed and mobile modules in plants contributes to their individuality as organisms in various ways. By integrating fixed structures such as the root system and the main stem, plants provide a stable foundation and structural support. Meanwhile, the main stem provides a framework for the plant and allows for upward growth towards sunlight. On the other hand, the integration of mobile modules such as leaves, flowers, and branches brings flexibility and adaptability to plants. Branches enable the plant to expand its reach, explore new areas, and optimize resource acquisition. The integration of these fixed and mobile modules into functional units plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. For instance, nutrition is facilitated by the roots and leaves working together. The integration of fixed and mobile modules is also crucial for plant reproduction. This integration is essential for plants to thrive and exhibit their individuality as organisms. dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant. In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots. Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots. Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or in the process of layering.

The English word is derived from the French tissu, meaning something that is woven, from the verb tisser, "to weave". For plants, the discipline is called plant anatomy.

While all animals can generally be considered to contain the four tissue types, the manifestation of these tissues can differ depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. The epithelium in all birds and animals is derived from the ectoderm and endoderm with a small contribution from the mesoderm, forming the endothelium, a specialized type of epithelium that composes the vasculature.

Moderation is a vague term that means different things to different people. 1440: What is the biggest nutritional concern you hear from patients and readers? Thomas: One of the biggest concerns tends to be a variety of questions related to “getting enough” of x, y, z. 1440: What is the most dangerous nutritional trend that you observe in modern life? In the extreme, these might be a ketogenic type of diet, and there may be short-term benefits, but I have very serious concerns about long-term effects of diets high in meat and fat.

The dermis contains small vessels that distribute drugs into the systemic circulation and to regulate temperature, a system known as the skin's microcirculation.

 A person's complexion is a biological trait. The epidermis of the body, very sensitive and delicate, reacts almost immediately to most outside effects. Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells. The epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, consists of several distinct layers with different characteristics and functions. In thick skin, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum is present between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. These processes form intercellular bridges with neighboring cells, contributing to the overall strength and integrity of the skin. These granules are involved in producing keratin and help to form a water barrier in the upper layers of the epidermis. On the surface of the skin is the stratum corneum, which is composed of fully keratinized cells. In thick skin, such as the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet, an additional layer called the stratum lucidum can be observed between the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum. Its function is to provide extra protection and thickness to these areas of the skin. It's important to note that the epidermis also contains other cell types, including melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells. In summary, the different layers of the epidermis have distinct characteristics and functions. From the basal layer to the outermost layer, the epidermis consists of keratinocytes that produce keratin, form intercellular bridges, and provide a water barrier. The epidermis also contains other cell types like melanocytes, Langerhans' cells, and Merkel's cells, which contribute to the skin's color, immune response, and sensory perception. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker.It serves many important functions, including regulating body temperature, maintaining water and electrolyte balance, and sensing painful and pleasant stimuli. Anything that interferes with skin function or causes changes in appearance can have important consequences for physical and mental health. Structure and Function

The skin has three layers—the epidermis, dermis, and fat layer (also called the subcutaneous layer). Epidermis: The epidermis is the relatively thin, tough, outer layer of the skin. Most of the cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes. They originate from cells in the deepest layer of the epidermis called the basal layer. The outermost portion of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum, is relatively waterproof and, when undamaged, prevents most bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances from entering the body. The epidermis (along with other layers of the skin) also protects the internal organs, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels against trauma. In certain areas of the body that require greater protection (such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet), the outer keratin layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is much thicker. Scattered throughout the basal layer of the epidermis are cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, one of the main contributors to skin color.Getting Under the Skin

Beatrice Prior is warned that she is Divergent and thus will never fit into any one of the factions. The film was released in June 2017 and gave Jenkins the biggest domestic opening for a female director, surpassing previous record holder Fifty Shades of Grey by Sam Taylor-Johnson. This film helped Jenkins become admired by critics and liked by fans and audiences.

 Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the killing of a convicted criminal by the state as punishment for crimes known as capital crimes or capital offences. Among democratic countries around the world, all European (except Belarus) and Latin American states, many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and Timor Leste), and Canada have abolished capital punishment, while the majority of the United States, Guatemala, and most of the Caribbean as well as some democracies in Asia (e.g., Japan and India) and Africa (e.g., Botswana and Zambia) retain it.

In cases of multiple murder, where the offence occurred after 2 December 2011 (the date new legislation came into force), a court may, after considering any jury recommendation, order consecutive parole ineligibility periods for each murder. There is no death penalty in Canada, making life imprisonment the most severe punishment to be imposed in the country. No executions have occurred in the United Kingdom since the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act. The 1965 act left four capital offences: high treason, "piracy with violence" (piracy with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm), arson in royal dockyards and espionage, as well as other capital offences under military law. During the Troubles Westminster passed the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, abolishing Stormont, and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, abolishing the death penalty for murder there. The death penalty was not fully abolished in the United Kingdom until 1998 by the Human Rights Act and the Crime and Disorder Act. There are 33 capital crimes, including murder, drug trafficking, treason, acts of terrorism, waging war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, and, since 2003, rape resulting in death or rape of a child. Executions are carried out by hanging. However, with ongoing discussions to repeal the death penalty as a mandatory sentence, such as a bill tabled by the Malaysian government in October 2018,  these serious crimes may only face the possibility of the death penalty in a High Court sentencing. In October 2018, the government had also imposed a moratorium on all executions until the death penalty is abolished. In March 2019, however, the government announced they had decided it will not abolish the death penalty. In 10 December 2019, the Law Minister had announced that an anticipated proposal on alternatives to the death penalty will be submitted in January 2020, allowing judges a discretion in certain serious crimes. Newspapers across Canada carried accounts of the hanging, with The British Columbian at New Westminster, British Columbia, reporting on 9 January 1953, under a large black heading "Madame Corbeau Goes to Gallows" that "Mrs. Marguerite Pitre, a 43-year-old [sic] Quebec City housewife who put a time-bomb aboard an airliner that later crashed and killed 23 persons, was hanged early today at Bordeaux jail as Canada closed the books on its most fantastic murder in history." In November 2007, Canada's minority Conservative government reversed a longstanding policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, who has been on death row in the United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government "should stand consistently against the death penalty, as a matter of principle, both in Canada and around the world". In a 2011 interview given to Canadian media, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper affirmed his private support for capital punishment by saying, "I personally think there are times where capital punishment is appropriate."

 an emissary from Sauron, the lord of Mordor, twice came to Erebor and spoke to Dáin Ironfoot, who was still King under the Mountain. The messenger asked for assistance in finding Bilbo Baggins and retrieving a stolen ring, and in return offered Moria and three of the seven Dwarf rings to Dáin, but he said neither Yea or Nay. Sauron's northern army, which included many Easterlings, then attacked; Dale was overrun, and many Dwarves and Men took refuge in Erebor, which was promptly surrounded. Dáin was killed before the gates of Erebor defending the body of his fallen ally King Brand of Dale. Dáin's son Thorin III Stonehelm and King Bard II withstood the siege and routed Sauron's forces. Thorin, mad with greed, refused all claims and sent word to his second cousin Dáin II Ironfoot, chief of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, who brought reinforcements to the aid of Thorin and Company. However before any battle began, an army of Orcs and Wargs descended on Erebor. During this battle, Thorin's nephews Fíli and Kíli were killed, and Thorin himself was mortally injured; he died shortly afterwards. The title of King under the Mountain passed to Dáin. Erebor became the home of the Folk of Durin, a clan of Dwarves known as the Longbeards, after they were driven from their ancestral home of Khazad-dûm. In the latter days of the Third Age, this Kingdom under the Mountain held one of the largest dwarvish treasure hoards in Middle-earth.

 an emissary from Sauron, the lord of Mordor, twice came to Erebor and spoke to Dáin Ironfoot, who was still King under the Mountain. The messenger asked for assistance in finding Bilbo Baggins and retrieving a stolen ring, and in return offered Moria and three of the seven Dwarf rings to Dáin, but he said neither Yea or Nay. Sauron's northern army, which included many Easterlings, then attacked; Dale was overrun, and many Dwarves and Men took refuge in Erebor, which was promptly surrounded. Dáin was killed before the gates of Erebor defending the body of his fallen ally King Brand of Dale. Dáin's son Thorin III Stonehelm and King Bard II withstood the siege and routed Sauron's forces. Thorin, mad with greed, refused all claims and sent word to his second cousin Dáin II Ironfoot, chief of the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, who brought reinforcements to the aid of Thorin and Company. However before any battle began, an army of Orcs and Wargs descended on Erebor. During this battle, Thorin's nephews Fíli and Kíli were killed, and Thorin himself was mortally injured; he died shortly afterwards. The title of King under the Mountain passed to Dáin. Erebor became the home of the Folk of Durin, a clan of Dwarves known as the Longbeards, after they were driven from their ancestral home of Khazad-dûm. In the latter days of the Third Age, this Kingdom under the Mountain held one of the largest dwarvish treasure hoards in Middle-earth.

During the course of the destructive and costly World War I, for the first time in history, the concept of "the war to end war" began to be seriously considered. As a further expression of that hope, upon the conclusion of the war, the League of Nations was formed. Its primary aim was to prevent war, as all signatories to the League of Nations Covenant were required to agree to desist from the initiation of all wars, preemptive or otherwise. Following the Race to the Sea, both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches, stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France, which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for "a war to end all wars" that would "make the world safe for democracy", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. Within weeks, the Germans, Russians, French and British had all entered the fray which eventually became known as World War I. Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip. Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire). Over 60 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 

 sank seven US merchant ships, Wilson finally went to Congress calling for a declaration of war on Germany, which Congress voted on April 6, 1917. This helped overcome Wilson's reluctance to having the US fight alongside a country ruled by an absolutist monarch. Congress declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917, but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various small co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers. The American entry into World War I came on April 6, 1917, after a year long effort by President Woodrow Wilson to get the United States into the war. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe. Contrary to the Germans' expectations, Great Britain, along with the British Empire, declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London had demanded. However, they could do little against the 1.5 million-strong German invading force. The impetus for Germany's involvement in WW1 was its alliance with Austria-Hungary who declared war on Serbia on the 28th of July 1914, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The alliance system of WW1 pitted the Centrals Powers, encompassing Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria against the Allied Powers which compromised Russia, France, Great Britain and the United States. It rapidly mobilized its civilian economy for the war effort.

These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. For example, acid rain can kill trees, and can kill fish by acidifying lakes. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic pH of about 5.2, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid, a weak acid (pH 5.6 in distilled water), but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals. Nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena, caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules, can result in the production of acid rain, if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation, thus creating acid rain. This effect, together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys ozone (O3). Gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain. Interaction of and other  with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere can form acid rain which harms sensitive ecosystems such as lakes and forests. It is an important gas that contributes to environmental concerns. This can have significant impacts on air quality and can contribute to the formation of acid rain. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and when these fossil fuels are burned, sulfur dioxide is released into the air. Industrial activities such as power generation, manufacturing, and transportation all contribute to sulfur dioxide emissions. The environmental concerns associated with sulfur dioxide stem from its effects on human health and ecosystems. In addition to its direct health effects, sulfur dioxide plays a role in the formation of acid rain. When SO2 reacts with oxygen and other pollutants in the atmosphere, it can form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Acid rain occurs when this acidic precipitation falls to the ground, causing harm to plants, aquatic life, and infrastructure. This nitric acid contributes to acid rain or may deposit to soil, where it makes nitrate, which is of use to growing plants. CaO + SO2 → CaSO3 Sulfur dioxide is a noticeable component in the atmosphere, especially following volcanic eruptions. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of sulfur dioxide released in the U.S. per year was: Sulfur dioxide is a major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human health. In addition, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the habitat suitability for plant communities, as well as animal life. Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to acid rain and atmospheric particulates. This improvement resulted in part from 

The major contributor to acid rain is not carbon monoxide. Acid rain is primarily caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. When SO2 and NOx react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere, they form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, which can then fall to the ground as acid rain. It is important for industries and individuals to take measures to reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of acid rain.

Alcohol misuse amongst Native Americans has been shown to be associated with development of disease, including hearing and vision problems, kidney and bladder problems, head injuries, pneumonia, tuberculosis, dental problems, liver problems, and pancreatitis. Alcohol education and prevention programs have focused on raising self-esteem, emphasizing traditional values, and recruiting Native youth to advocate for abstinence and healthy substitution. Historically, those Native American tribes who manufactured alcoholic drinks used them and other mind-altering substances in ritual settings and rarely for personal enjoyment; liquor was unknown until introduced by Europeans. Native American leaders campaigned with limited success to educate Native Americans about the dangers of drinking and intoxication. Legislation prohibiting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans generally failed to prevent alcohol-related social and health problems, and discriminatory legislation was abandoned in the 1950s in favor of laws passed in Native American communities by Native Americans. Modern treatment focuses on culturally appropriate strategies that emphasize traditional activities designed to promote spiritual harmony and group solidarity. Among contemporary Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 11.7% of all deaths are related to alcohol.

[2024-06-14 14:55:44,720] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: Krypton (from 'the hidden one') is a chemical element with the symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas that occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. With rare exceptions, krypton is chemically inert. Krypton, like the other noble gases, is used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has many spectral lines, and krypton plasma is useful in bright, high-powered gas lasers (krypton ion and excimer lasers), each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line. Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser medium. From 1960 to 1983, the official length of a meter was defined by the 606-nanometer wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton-86, because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes. Kr + F2 → KrF2 2 Kr + → 2 KrF 2 KrF → 2 Kr +  Like the other noble gases, krypton is chemically highly unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of krypton in the +2 oxidation state parallels that of the neighboring element bromine in the +1 oxidation state; due to the scandide contraction it is difficult to oxidize the 4p elements to their group oxidation states. Following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in 1962, synthesis of krypton difluoride was reported in 1963. In the same year, was reported by Grosse, et al., but was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification. extreme conditions, krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF2 according to the following equation:  Krypton gas in a krypton fluoride laser absorbs energy from a source, causing the krypton to react with fluorine gas, producing the exciplex krypton fluoride, a temporary complex in an excited energy state:  The complex can undergo spontaneous or stimulated emission, reducing its energy state to a metastable, but highly repulsive ground state. The ground state complex quickly dissociates into unbound atoms:  The result is an exciplex laser which radiates energy at 248 nm, near the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, corresponding with the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state of the complex. Compounds with krypton 

 Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. Neon was discovered by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton. In 1960, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures defined the meter as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of light emitted by the krypton-86 isotope. This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström based on the red cadmium spectral line, replacing it with 1 Å = 10−10 m. The krypton-86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference, which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in vacuum during 1/299,792,458 s.

A Rochester company is developing a high-sensitivity bioassay technology for early detection of a broad scope of diseases such as ovarian cancer. In the first phase, CCMR enabled the company to work with a Cornell Chemistry expert who synthesized the reagents necessary to conduct the assay. In a follow-up project, the company used CCMR’s high-resolution transmission electron microscope to study the size and detailed structure of the polymer nanoparticles, which contain the metal catalyst necessary for the signal amplification reaction. The company benefited from the help of two Cornell experts and from CCMR matching funds to develop a test method for evaluating new and existing foam ear cuffs used on its products. A startup focusing on commercializing biological assays to detect hard-to-discern infectious diseases developed a test using Raman spectroscopy with the help of CCMR experts. Using the CCMR Raman and the expertise of a Cornell Materials scientist, the company tested the effects of varying conditions and morphology of their nanostructured metal surfaces and the resulting enhancement of the Raman signal produced in presence of the molecule of interest. There are also unverified reports of a barium salt of a krypton oxoacid. ArKr+ and KrH+ polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for KrXe or KrXe+. The reaction of with  produces an unstable compound,, that contains a krypton-oxygen bond. A krypton-nitrogen bond is found in the cation [HC≡N–Kr–F], produced by the reaction of with [HC≡NH][AsF] below −50 °C. HKrCN and HKrC≡CH (krypton hydride-cyanide and hydrokryptoacetylene) were reported to be stable up to 40 K. Krypton hydride (Kr(H2)4) crystals can be grown at pressures above 5 GPa. They have a face-centered cubic structure where krypton octahedra are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules. Artificial skin is a collagen scaffold that induces regeneration of skin in mammals such as humans. The term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive burns. It has been developed commercially under the name Integra and is used in massively burned patients, during plastic surgery of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds. 'Artificial skin' can also refer to flexible semiconductor materials that can sense touch for those with prosthetic limbs, (also experimental). Until the late twentieth century, skin grafts were constructed from the patient's own skin.

During the knockout rounds, if the score is tied after four quarters (32 minutes), penalty shootouts, which is 5 rounds, plus extra rounds if tied, are used to determine the winner. If the final tournament hosts Indonesia win their group or are among the five best runners-up, the sixth best runner-up also qualifies for the final tournament. The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia saw early elimination for Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia who all lost their first two group games. Nigeria also lost their first group game against Croatia 2–0, but the team got a win in their second game, over Iceland 2–0, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists Argentina. However, they lost the decisive game, and were eliminated after finishing third in the group. Senegal won their opening game against Poland 2–1, and drew their second game against Japan, leaving them needing a draw in their final game against Colombia to be sure of progressing. ; Wild Card - CONIFA's Executive Committee issues a Wild Card place to a team that has not yet qualified for the WFC no later than 9 months prior to the start of the tournament. The committee also has the right to issue a second Wild Card if approved 

 Initially, the first stage was disputed by 29 teams divided by five groups of four and three groups of three. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage. In the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. In the preliminary round and intermediate round, each group is played as a round-robin mini-tournament at one of the teams selected as hosts after the draw. In the final tournament, the eight qualified teams play a group stage (two groups of four) followed by the final between the group winners, at a host selected by UEFA from one of the teams. In the first round of the competition, teams were divided into two groups of four teams, and play followed a round robin format with each of the teams playing all other teams in the pool once. All ties in the standings will be broken by point differential Following the completion of the group games, all eight teams advanced to a single elimination round consisting of four quarterfinal games, two semifinal games, and the bronze and gold medal matches.

Official Reports (PDF): 1900–1996; ; Official Results Books (PDF): 2000–2016; ; Olympedia: 1900–2016; ; Sports Reference: 1900–2016. The top four teams in each group advance to the knockout rounds. During the knockout rounds, if the score is tied after four quarters (32 minutes), penalty shootouts, which is 5 rounds, plus extra rounds if tied, are used to determine the winner. If the final tournament hosts Indonesia win their group or are among the five best runners-up, the sixth best runner-up also qualifies for the final tournament. The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia saw early elimination for Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia who all lost their first two group games. Nigeria also lost their first group game against Croatia 2–0, but the team got a win in their second game, over Iceland 2–0, leaving them with a chance if they could get a result against 2014 finalists Argentina. However, they lost the decisive game, and were eliminated after finishing third in the group. Senegal won their opening game against Poland 2–1, and drew their second game against Japan, leaving them needing a draw in their final game against Colombia to be sure of progressing. ; Wild Card - CONIFA's Executive Committee issues a Wild Card place to a team that has not yet qualified for the WFC no later than 9 months prior to the start of the tournament. The committee also has the right to issue a second Wild Card if approved 

 Initially, the first stage was disputed by 29 teams divided by five groups of four and three groups of three. The two highest ranked teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage. In the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final), with each eliminating the losers. In the preliminary round and intermediate round, each group is played as a round-robin mini-tournament at one of the teams selected as hosts after the draw. In the final tournament, the eight qualified teams play a group stage (two groups of four) followed by the final between the group winners, at a host selected by UEFA from one of the teams. In the first round of the competition, teams were divided into two groups of four teams, and play followed a round robin format with each of the teams playing all other teams in the pool once. All ties in the standings will be broken by point differential Following the completion of the group games, all eight teams advanced to a single elimination round consisting of four quarterfinal games, two semifinal games, and the bronze and gold medal matches.

The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. The pulmonary and systemic circulations take the blood through large arteries first and then branches into smaller arteries before reaching arterioles and capillaries. After capillaries, the blood enters the venules before joining smaller veins first and then larger veins before reaching the right heart. The pelvis and legs get their blood from the common iliac arteries. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. The process begins in the heart, where the right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the largest vein in the body, called the vena cava. From the right ventricle, the deoxygenated blood is pumped out of the heart through the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The oxygenated blood enters the left atrium and flows into the left ventricle. It is then pumped out of the heart through the largest artery in the body called the aorta. As the blood reaches the capillaries, which are the smallest blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients diffuse out of the bloodstream and into the surrounding tissues. At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide diffuse from the tissues into the capillaries. This exchange of gases and nutrients occurs due to the thin walls of the capillaries. Once the oxygen and nutrients have been delivered to the tissues, the capillaries converge into larger veins, which carry the deoxygenated blood back to the heart. In summary, the circulatory system delivers oxygenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the body through the arteries, while deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart through the veins. Arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins make up the vasculature. The pulmonary and the systemic circulations are the two parts of the vasculature. This blood carries oxygen to all of the body except to the lungs.The contraction of the left ventricle propels blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs, where oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed from it. The left side pumps blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen and nutrients are delivered to tissues and waste products (such as carbon dioxide) are transferred to the blood for removal by other organs (such as the lungs and kidneys). Blood travels the following circuit: Blood from the body, which is depleted of oxygen and laden with carbon dioxide, flows through the two largest veins (the venae cavae) into the right atrium. This contraction propels blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which supply the lungs. In the lungs, blood flows through the tiny capillaries that surround the air sacs. Here, the blood absorbs oxygen and gives up carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled. Blood from the lungs, which is now oxygen-rich, flows through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium. (In older people, the left ventricle does not fill as well before the left atrium contracts, making this contraction of the left atrium especially important.) Its inferior surface lies over the central tendon of the diaphragm. The aorta is the main and largest artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation.

They were the precursors of the sport cards and other trading cards. John Arthur Dixon (18 June 1897 - 19 May 1958) was the British founder of the eponymous manufacturer of greetings cards and postcards. In 1926, he moved to Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, where he bought a small printing business. Dixon was a keen photographer, and in 1937 he produced his first Christmas cards. Initially, he was producing postcards under contract for W. J. Nigh & Sons Ltd, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. From 1937 (evidenced by a postmark on a colour tinted photo card of Shanklin Old Village) he was producing postcards on his own account. In 1951, more than 14 million greetings cards were produced and in 1955, nearly 30 million postcards. On March 1, 1907, Federal legislation permitted senders, for the first time, to include a message on a portion of the back of a postcard. (Prior to that time, the address only was allowed on one side while the other side could present a photo or artwork.) No other single format 

 In 1903 Kodak introduced the No. In 1907, Kodak introduced a service called "real photo postcards," which enabled customers to make a postcard from any picture they took. Austria-Hungary's Postmaster General Vincenz Baron Maly von Vevanovič took up the idea, and in September 1869 the "Correspondence Card" was officially introduced in Austria by ministerial order. These cards came in two sizes. The larger size was found to be slightly too large for ease of handling, and was soon withdrawn in favour of cards 13mm (1⁄2 inch) shorter. 75 million of these cards were sent within Britain during 1870. The earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer Theodore Hook. Hook posted the card, which bears a penny black stamp, to himself in 1840 from Fulham (part of London). He probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002 the postcard sold for a record £31,750. In the United States, the custom of sending through the mail, at letter rate, a picture or blank card stock that held a message, began with a card postmarked in December 1848 containing printed advertising. The first commercially produced card was created in 1861 by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who patented a private postal card, and sold the rights to Hymen Lipman, whose postcards, complete with a decorated border, were marketed as "Lipman's Postal Card". These cards had no images. While the United States government allowed privately printed cards as early as February 1861, they saw little use until 1870, when experiments were done on their commercial viability. His best known work involved the designing of Christmas cards for UNICEF and the New York Graphic Society, which gave him international recognition.

[2024-06-14 14:55:54,107] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: "I Still Can't Get Over Loving You" is a 1983 song written and performed by Ray Parker Jr.. It was Parker's fifth Top 20 hit, the sixth being 1984's "Ghostbusters". A turning point in the tone occurs when Parker borrows a line from The Police's "Every Breath You Take", "Every breath you take, I'll be watching you." Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson saw "Running on Empty" as embodying a "tenacious, win/lose duality" and being "what daydreamers have nightmares about". Billboard Magazine described the song as "fiery rock 'n' roll that continues in intensity throughout" while containing "serious lyric content" from the singer/songwriter's "identifiable gritty vocal". With its number 11 peak on the Hot 100 in Spring 1978, "Running on Empty" was Browne's third-biggest hit single in his career (trailing only "Doctor My Eyes" and "Somebody's Baby"), and subsequently became his most-played song on classic rock radio formats. Singer Paul Robb said, ""Walking Away" was a song where I sat down and said, "I want to write a song that's kind of like "What's on Your Mind," but it's going to be directed to some former members of our band who had sort of quit the band at an importune moment. As a matter of fact, they both quit right before we made it big with "Running." So if you listen to the lyrics of "Walking Away," it's basically just someone complaining about people who left. "If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)" is a song written by Murray Kellum and Dan Mitchell, and recorded by American country music band Alabama. The chorus references "Faded Love" by Texas musician Bob Wills and "Louisiana Man" by Doug Kershaw repeatedly throughout this song. "Who Will You Run To" is a song recorded by American rock band Heart. It was composed by Diane Warren and released as a single from Heart's ninth studio album, Bad Animals. and on April 8, 2003, released his solo debut album with UpRok Records, entitled Out of Knowhere. Footsoldiers also collaborated with KRS-One on his album Life, with Petty appearing on the song "I Ain't Leaving". Wexler had her record the Bert Berns penned and produced song, "I'm Gonna Run Away From You", for Atco Records, but the song was not released at the time, although it was released in the UK on Atlantic (AT.4071). In 1971, "I'm Gonna Run Away From You" was released as a single, with "The Boy Next Door" as the B-side, on Mojo and Atlantic, where it became a hit in the UK among devotees of Northern soul. Lynn occasionally worked as a backup singer. She sang on many Dr. John's albums, 

 "I'll Come Running" is a song written by Neil Diamond. It was first released by Diamond in July 1966 as the B-side to his US top-ten single "Cherry, Cherry", before being included on his debut album The Feel of Neil Diamond, released in August 1966. Wright also recorded it on his own self-titled debut album for Liberty Records in 1992. In 1993, Walker opened for George Strait and Alan Jackson and he stated in an interview with Billboard "I'm real grateful for the opportunity to open for those guys", with only one hit record, it's hard to keep the audience's attention for 45 minutes, but it's working. Now, there are so many acts who do it, you just gotta go right back out and do it again." For their second album, the members of Journey toned down the overt progressiveness of their first, self-titled release, in favor of a more focused approach. The album also features a cover version of The Beatles' "It's All Too Much" from the 1968 Yellow Submarine film and 1969 soundtrack. Guitarist George Tickner left the band after having co-written two songs for this album, leaving members Gregg Rolie (lead vocals/keyboards), Neal Schon (guitar), Ross Valory (bass), and Aynsley Dunbar (drums).

2024-06-14 14:55:54 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: "I Still Can't Get Over Loving You" is a 1983 song written and performed by Ray Parker Jr.. It was Parker's fifth Top 20 hit, the sixth being 1984's "Ghostbusters". A turning point in the tone occurs when Parker borrows a line from The Police's "Every Breath You Take", "Every breath you take, I'll be watching you." Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson saw "Running on Empty" as embodying a "tenacious, win/lose duality" and being "what daydreamers have nightmares about". Billboard Magazine described the song as "fiery rock 'n' roll that continues in intensity throughout" while containing "serious lyric content" from the singer/songwriter's "identifiable gritty vocal". With its number 11 peak on the Hot 100 in Spring 1978, "Running on Empty" was Browne's third-biggest hit single in his career (trailing only "Doctor My Eyes" and "Somebody's Baby"), and subsequently became his most-played song on classic rock radio formats. Singer Paul Robb said, ""Walking Away" was a song where I sat down and said, "I want to write a song that's kind of like "What's on Your Mind," but it's going to be directed to some former members of our band who had sort of quit the band at an importune moment. As a matter of fact, they both quit right before we made it big with "Running." So if you listen to the lyrics of "Walking Away," it's basically just someone complaining about people who left. "If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)" is a song written by Murray Kellum and Dan Mitchell, and recorded by American country music band Alabama. The chorus references "Faded Love" by Texas musician Bob Wills and "Louisiana Man" by Doug Kershaw repeatedly throughout this song. "Who Will You Run To" is a song recorded by American rock band Heart. It was composed by Diane Warren and released as a single from Heart's ninth studio album, Bad Animals. and on April 8, 2003, released his solo debut album with UpRok Records, entitled Out of Knowhere. Footsoldiers also collaborated with KRS-One on his album Life, with Petty appearing on the song "I Ain't Leaving". Wexler had her record the Bert Berns penned and produced song, "I'm Gonna Run Away From You", for Atco Records, but the song was not released at the time, although it was released in the UK on Atlantic (AT.4071). In 1971, "I'm Gonna Run Away From You" was released as a single, with "The Boy Next Door" as the B-side, on Mojo and Atlantic, where it became a hit in the UK among devotees of Northern soul. Lynn occasionally worked as a backup singer. She sang on many Dr. John's albums, 

 "I'll Come Running" is a song written by Neil Diamond. It was first released by Diamond in July 1966 as the B-side to his US top-ten single "Cherry, Cherry", before being included on his debut album The Feel of Neil Diamond, released in August 1966. Wright also recorded it on his own self-titled debut album for Liberty Records in 1992. In 1993, Walker opened for George Strait and Alan Jackson and he stated in an interview with Billboard "I'm real grateful for the opportunity to open for those guys", with only one hit record, it's hard to keep the audience's attention for 45 minutes, but it's working. Now, there are so many acts who do it, you just gotta go right back out and do it again." For their second album, the members of Journey toned down the overt progressiveness of their first, self-titled release, in favor of a more focused approach. The album also features a cover version of The Beatles' "It's All Too Much" from the 1968 Yellow Submarine film and 1969 soundtrack. Guitarist George Tickner left the band after having co-written two songs for this album, leaving members Gregg Rolie (lead vocals/keyboards), Neal Schon (guitar), Ross Valory (bass), and Aynsley Dunbar (drums).

[2024-06-14 14:55:56,284] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria). After Russia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. Napoleon's arrival from Egypt led to the fall of the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. Napoleon then reorganized the French army and launched a new assault against the Austrians in Italy during the spring of 1800. In a series of conflicts from 1803 to 1815, known as the Napoleonic Wars, the alliances of the powers of Europe formed five coalitions against the First French Empire of Napoleon. French power rose quickly, conquering most of Europe, but collapsed rapidly after France's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–1814 campaigns, resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication, and his banishment to the Island of Saint Helena, concluded the Napoleonic wars. Though Napoleon had a warlike reputation, his policies in his first years as First Consul were aimed at restoring peace in Europe, albeit at terms favorable to France. Talleyrand and Napoleon therefore saw a possibility of a compromise, in which France would retain its chain of docile client states, but with the "revolutionary" sting removed, to appease the Allies. France therefore embarked on a 

 The French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The First French Empire was the regime established by Napoleon I in France. This empire lasted from 1804 to 1814, from the Consulate of the First French Republic to the Bourbon Restoration, and was briefly restored during the Hundred Days in 1815. The Second French Empire was the regime established in France by Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic. Napoleon was a French military leader who rose to power during the French Revolution and who, in 1804, transformed the First French Republic into the First French Empire, five years after his coup d'état of November 1799 (18 Brumaire). Napoleon and the Grande Armée had to fight against every major European power (except for the ones he was allied with, including Denmark-Norway) and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, expanding the power 

 Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms. These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man.

However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Austria). After Russia was humiliated by Napoleon opinion swung against France and stimulated and shaped German nationalism. The French swept away centuries worth of outmoded restrictions and introduced unprecedented levels of efficiency. The chaos and barriers in a land divided and subdivided among many different petty principalities gave way to a rational, simplified, centralized system controlled by Paris and run by Napoleon's relatives. Napoleon's arrival from Egypt led to the fall of the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, with Napoleon installing himself as Consul. Napoleon then reorganized the French army and launched a new assault against the Austrians in Italy during the spring of 1800. In a series of conflicts from 1803 to 1815, known as the Napoleonic Wars, the alliances of the powers of Europe formed five coalitions against the First French Empire of Napoleon. French power rose quickly, conquering most of Europe, but collapsed rapidly after France's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–1814 campaigns, resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the Hundred Days, his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication, and his banishment to the Island of Saint Helena, concluded the Napoleonic wars. Though Napoleon had a warlike reputation, his policies in his first years as First Consul were aimed at restoring peace in Europe, albeit at terms favorable to France. Talleyrand and Napoleon therefore saw a possibility of a compromise, in which France would retain its chain of docile client states, but with the "revolutionary" sting removed, to appease the Allies. France therefore embarked on a 

 The French Revolution and Napoleon influenced Italy more deeply than they affected any other outside country of Europe. The First French Empire was the regime established by Napoleon I in France. This empire lasted from 1804 to 1814, from the Consulate of the First French Republic to the Bourbon Restoration, and was briefly restored during the Hundred Days in 1815. The Second French Empire was the regime established in France by Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second French Republic and the Third French Republic. Napoleon was a French military leader who rose to power during the French Revolution and who, in 1804, transformed the First French Republic into the First French Empire, five years after his coup d'état of November 1799 (18 Brumaire). Napoleon and the Grande Armée had to fight against every major European power (except for the ones he was allied with, including Denmark-Norway) and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, expanding the power 

 Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire.

The song was a number one hit on the Canadian country and adult contemporary charts published by RPM, reaching its peak on both charts for the week of December 31, 1977. Rogers used the song as a b-side to two of his later singles: "Lady" in 1980 and "You Were a Good Friend" in 1983. Later in 1977, Dolly Parton included the song on her Here You Come Again album (Parton and Alison Krauss performed the song together at the 2010 concert at Foxwoods Casino honoring Rogers' fifty years in entertainment); Reba McEntire covered the song in 2001 on her album Greatest Hits Volume III: I'm a Survivor. An interesting side note is that while performing in Saskatoon in 1961, Cash selected a girl from the audience named Alexandra Wiwcharuk to sing the song to. The story goes that once Cash heard this news he never sang the song again." The album's title track, "Coat of Many Colors", tells of how Parton's mother stitched together a coat for her daughter out of rags given to the family. The excited child, "with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes," rushed to school, "just to find the others laughing and making fun of me" for wearing a coat made of rags. The album was written entirely by Parton except for three tracks written by Porter Wagoner. The recording would eventually surface on Ronstadt's 1982 album Get Closer. Parton also cut the song for a third time, including it on her 2001 album, Little Sparrow. Parton re-recorded "Early Morning Breeze" for 1974's Jolene and again for inclusion as a bonus track on the Walmart edition of her 2014 album, Blue Smoke. The bonus track "My Heart Started Breaking" was later re-recorded and included on Parton's 1975 album, Dolly. Parton re-recorded "Here I Am" as a duet with Sia for the 2018 soundtrack album, Dumplin'. At the start of 1957, the number-one position on all three charts was held by "Singing the Blues" by Marty Robbins, who achieved a second number one in June with "A White Sport Coat (And A Pink Carnation)". The latter song also topped all three charts and was at number one on the final C&W juke box chart published by Billboard. Robbins was the only artist with more than one chart-topper on the juke box listing, and his total 

 a dance-focused form of the genre called neocountry that was popularized, in part, by the movie Urban Cowboy. In the song, the singer explains her relationship with country music as being authentic and part of long tradition, and not a part of some fad or, worse, something that's merely "cool." The song was the first track released from Mandrell's 1981 "Live" album. Applause from the audience can be heard in the beginning and end of the song, as well as when Jones makes his guest performance and when Mandrell refers to Jones in the lyrics in the early part of the song. Margo started performing country music at a young age in 1964 with a local showband, The Keynotes. She recorded her first single in 1968, "Bonny Irish Boy/Dear God", and followed this with a second single, "If I Could See the World Through the Eyes of a Child/Road By the River", released in 1969. Her 2019 album "Old and New" contains original tribute songs to two of her greatest influences, Liz Anderson and Jean Shepard. She has recorded a number of songs written by Liz Anderson and also a number written by Dolly Parton and on her album Margo and Friends she duets with Parton on "God's Coloring Book". Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Parton was honored in 2003 with a tribute album called Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton. The artists who recorded versions of Parton's songs included Melissa Etheridge ("I Will Always Love You"), Alison Krauss ("9 to 5"), Shania Twain ("Coat of Many Colors"), Meshell Ndegeocello ("Two Doors Down"), Norah Jones ("The Grass is Blue"), and Sinéad O'Connor ("Dagger Through the Heart"). Parton herself contributed a re-recording of the title song, originally the title song for her first RCA album in 1968.

Parton re-recorded "Early Morning Breeze" for 1974's Jolene and again for inclusion as a bonus track on the Walmart edition of her 2014 album, Blue Smoke. The bonus track "My Heart Started Breaking" was later re-recorded and included on Parton's 1975 album, Dolly. Parton re-recorded "Here I Am" as a duet with Sia for the 2018 soundtrack album, Dumplin'. At the start of 1957, the number-one position on all three charts was held by "Singing the Blues" by Marty Robbins, who achieved a second number one in June with "A White Sport Coat (And A Pink Carnation)". The latter song also topped all three charts and was at number one on the final C&W juke box chart published by Billboard. Robbins was the only artist with more than one chart-topper on the juke box listing, and his total 

 a dance-focused form of the genre called neocountry that was popularized, in part, by the movie Urban Cowboy. In the song, the singer explains her relationship with country music as being authentic and part of long tradition, and not a part of some fad or, worse, something that's merely "cool." The song was the first track released from Mandrell's 1981 "Live" album. Applause from the audience can be heard in the beginning and end of the song, as well as when Jones makes his guest performance and when Mandrell refers to Jones in the lyrics in the early part of the song. Margo started performing country music at a young age in 1964 with a local showband, The Keynotes. She recorded her first single in 1968, "Bonny Irish Boy/Dear God", and followed this with a second single, "If I Could See the World Through the Eyes of a Child/Road By the River", released in 1969. Her 2019 album "Old and New" contains original tribute songs to two of her greatest influences, Liz Anderson and Jean Shepard. She has recorded a number of songs written by Liz Anderson and also a number written by Dolly Parton and on her album Margo and Friends she duets with Parton on "God's Coloring Book". Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Parton was honored in 2003 with a tribute album called Just Because I'm a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton. The artists who recorded versions of Parton's songs included Melissa Etheridge ("I Will Always Love You"), Alison Krauss ("9 to 5"), Shania Twain ("Coat of Many Colors"), Meshell Ndegeocello ("Two Doors Down"), Norah Jones ("The Grass is Blue"), and Sinéad O'Connor ("Dagger Through the Heart"). Parton herself contributed a re-recording of the title song, originally the title song for her first RCA album in 1968.

Their script was based on the lives of Stewart and Cyril Marcus and on the novel Twins by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland, a "highly fictionalized" version of the Marcuses' story. The film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 Genie Awards, notably Best Motion Picture.

The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn). The intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the

New York covers an area of 54,556 square miles (141,299 km2) making it the 27th largest state by total area (but 30th by land area). The state borders six U.S. states: Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the south, and Connecticut, Rhode Island (across Long Island Sound), Massachusetts, and Vermont to the east. Additionally, New York touches the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and two of the Great Lakes: Lake Erie to the west and Lake Ontario to the northwest. It is also the second-most populous city in the Northeastern United States, behind New York City.

Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:56:00 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Population New York State has a primarily urban population. The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn). The intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the 

 has 15 million residents in a 100-mile radius including Philadelphia (1.5 million in its city limits), northern New Jersey and Connecticut. A simple majority of New York's population lives within two hours of New York City. New York covers an area of 54,556 square miles (141,299 km2) making it the 27th largest state by total area (but 30th by land area). The state borders six U.S. states: Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the south, and Connecticut, Rhode Island (across Long Island Sound), Massachusetts, and Vermont to the east. Additionally, New York touches the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and two of the Great Lakes: Lake Erie to the west and Lake Ontario to the northwest. It is also the second-most populous city in the Northeastern United States, behind New York City. Since 1854, the city has had the same geographic boundaries as Philadelphia County, the most-populous county in Pennsylvania and the urban core of the eighth-largest U.S. metropolitan statistical area, with over 6 million residents.

The subducting plate releases volatiles and solutes to these volcanoes, resulting in acidic fluids with higher concentrations of gases and metals than in the mid-ocean ridge. When hotspot volcanoes occur in the middle of oceanic plates, they create permeable and porous basalts with higher concentrations of gas than at mid-ocean ridges. Oceanic detachment faults occur at spreading ridges where magmatic activity is not enough to account for the entire plate spreading rate. They are characterized by long domes parallel to the spreading direction (oceanic core complexes of the footwall). They cannot be structurally restored, as slip on the fault exceeds the thickness of oceanic crust (~30 km compared to ~6 km, for example). The footwall is also much more extensively hydrothermally altered than in continental settings. In contrast to many detachment faults in continental settings, oceanic detachment faults are usually rolling hinge normal faults, initiating at higher angles and rotating to low angles. Geologic tension is also found in the tectonic regions of divergent boundaries. Here, a magma chamber forms underneath oceanic crust and causes sea-floor spreading in the creation of new oceanic crust.

In the second year of training for my mental health nursing degree I spent a day with the ambulance service. From a road traffic accident to a fire and a cardiac arrest, I witnessed the variety of work undertaken daily by paramedics, and the complex range of skills required to do the job. The vehicle is prepared by the night crew, but as paramedics have the same level of clinical accountability as nurses, it was vital to double-check everything – if anything went wrong due to missing or faulty equipment the paramedic would be accountable. The traffic accident was our first call. His head was bleeding and he looked shocked, but he was fully conscious and breathing. Sarah took his physical observations and asked him what had happened, whether he was in pain and where, and what medications he was taking. After she had dressed his head wound the man was strapped to a spinal board so as not to exacerbate any musculoskeletal injuries he might have sustained. We took him to hospital and I observed the transfer of care to staff in the emergency department.

Talking to colleagues and having impromptu counselling sessions in the mess room of the ambulance station helped her to cope.

Our next call was a suspected cardiac arrest, so Sarah put the blue lights and siren on and drove fast. I had never seen a dead body before, so this

However, information regarding prescription drug abuse and addiction only seems to surface when someone famous has a problem and needs treatment or dies. Two types of the most commonly abused drugs are opioids and benzodiazepines. Like many other people, Sylvia’s doctor put her on Vicodin because she suffered from chronic migraines. But, like other narcotics, Vicodin lost its effectiveness over time. She could not use her insurance since she was buying several prescriptions of Vicodin at one time. She stole a prescription pad from one of her doctors and began to forge her own prescriptions. One day, she made the mistake of writing a date on the forged prescription that happened to be a Sunday. The pharmacist became suspicious and confronted her about it. By the time the police raided her house, she

After his older brother and roommate Brandon died 9 September 1999 of heart failure at the age of 25, Ward and his younger brother Andy traveled in India, Nepal, and Thailand. "It is just such a tragic loss of young lives. Young kids out on a Saturday night to enjoy themselves and something like this happens.

In the second year of training for my mental health nursing degree I spent a day with the ambulance service. From a road traffic accident to a fire and a cardiac arrest, I witnessed the variety of work undertaken daily by paramedics, and the complex range of skills required to do the job. The vehicle is prepared by the night crew, but as paramedics have the same level of clinical accountability as nurses, it was vital to double-check everything – if anything went wrong due to missing or faulty equipment the paramedic would be accountable. The traffic accident was our first call. His head was bleeding and he looked shocked, but he was fully conscious and breathing. Sarah took his physical observations and asked him what had happened, whether he was in pain and where, and what medications he was taking. After she had dressed his head wound the man was strapped to a spinal board so as not to exacerbate any musculoskeletal injuries he might have sustained. We took him to hospital and I observed the transfer of care to staff in the emergency department. From delivering babies to attending scenes where someone has died, she responds to a wide range of incidents, some of which require a great deal of emotional resilience. Talking to colleagues and having impromptu counselling sessions in the mess room of the ambulance station helped her to cope. But she said incidents can affect people in different ways, and it is important to have your own coping mechanisms. Our next call was a suspected cardiac arrest, so Sarah put the blue lights and siren on and drove fast. I had never seen a dead body before, so this

 Magbie was paralyzed from the neck down after being struck by a drunk driver at the age of four. The driver of the car, Bernard Beckett, pleaded guilty to the gun charges. A great deal has been written about alcoholism and drug addiction over the last two decades. However, information regarding prescription drug abuse and addiction only seems to surface when someone famous has a problem and needs treatment or dies. Two types of the most commonly abused drugs are opioids and benzodiazepines. Like many other people, Sylvia’s doctor put her on Vicodin because she suffered from chronic migraines. But, like other narcotics, Vicodin lost its effectiveness over time. She could not use her insurance since she was buying several prescriptions of Vicodin at one time. She stole a prescription pad from one of her doctors and began to forge her own prescriptions. One day, she made the mistake of writing a date on the forged prescription that happened to be a Sunday. The pharmacist became suspicious and confronted her about it. By the time the police raided her house, she

Agents that increase surface tension are "surface active" in the literal sense but are not called surfactants as their effect is opposite to the common meaning. Potassium hydrogencarbonate is used as a fire suppression agent ("BC dry chemical") in some dry chemical fire extinguishers, as the principal component of the Purple-K dry chemical, and in some applications of condensed aerosol fire suppression. It is the only dry chemical fire suppression agent recognized by the U.S. National Fire Protection Association for firefighting at airport crash rescue sites. Due to environmental concerns, trifluoroiodomethane (CF3I) is being considered as an alternative. The stream evaporates under reduced pressure, producing strong local cooling, as well as a high concentration of halon in the immediate vicinity of the fire.

 HFC-125 (ECARO-25 / FE-25 / NAF S 125) is a gaseous fire suppression agent which can be used in clean agent fire suppression systems. It is generally used in situations where water from a fire sprinkler would damage expensive equipment, or where water-based fire protection is impractical, such as museums, banks, clean rooms and hospitals. This makes it a highly effective fire fighting agent that is safe for people and causes no damage to equipment. HFC-125 is considered a Clean Agent and is therefore included in the National Fire Protection Association's 2001 - Standard for Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems. Flexible suction hose, also known as a suction hose, is a specific type of rigid fire hose used in drafting operations. When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an unpressurized supply, such as a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant.

As the woman, Princess Faustina, pleads with the slaver to release the boy (whom she refers to as "the savior"), all three are set upon by Rilara, a traveling bandit.

The video personifies the song's message of romantic escapism although a love interest is absent. The full music video was released on Rhett's YouTube channel two days later. It was directed by TK McKamy, who directed many of Rhett's previous music videos, including "Crash and Burn", "Die a Happy Man", and "Marry Me". Rhett said that he wanted the music video to remind viewers of a familiar moment in their life and capture the feeling of listening to a nostalgic song. The clips are intercut with shots of Rhett walking through a cornfield and playing guitar. The visual was nominated for Male Video of the Year at the 2021 CMT Music Awards.

The presence of fluorapatite helps prevent tooth decay or dental caries. Fluoroapatite has a critical pH of 4.5, thus it makes tooth structure more resistant to additional caries attack. It has a mild bacteriostatic property as well, which helps decrease the proliferation of Streptococcus mutans, the predominant bacterium related to dental caries. The prevalence of dental fluorosis is primarily attributed to the intake of excessive amounts of fluoride during the tooth development period, typically from birth to around 6-8 years of age. This condition occurs when there is an excessive incorporation of fluoride into dental enamel and dentine, which disrupts the normal maturation of the enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary from very mild, characterized by small white areas in the enamel, to severe cases where teeth appear stained and pitted. While drinking water is commonly associated with fluoride exposure, the increase in dental fluorosis prevalence over the past few decades is largely due to fluoride intake from sources other than drinking water. These additional sources include toothpastes, mouth rinses, fluoride supplements, fluoridated salt or milk, as well as locally applied dental gels, solutions, and varnishes. These sources contribute to the overall fluoride exposure during tooth development, leading to the development of dental fluorosis. It is worth noting that exposure to excessive levels of fluoride after tooth development, such as through drinking water, seems to have little impact on the extent of dental fluorosis. Therefore, it is during the period of enamel formation that fluoride intake should be carefully monitored to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis. Apart from dental fluorosis, excessive fluoride incorporation into bone can cause skeletal fluorosis. This condition occurs as a result of increased fluoride levels in the bone, leading to brittleness and a decreased ability to withstand pressure.

Mottled enamel, also known as dental fluorosis, is primarily caused by excessive exposure to fluoride during the development of teeth. Dental fluorosis occurs when high levels of fluoride are ingested during the tooth mineralization process, which usually occurs in childhood. While fluoride is beneficial for dental health in appropriate amounts, excessive intake can lead to the appearance of white or brown spots on the teeth. When children are exposed to excessive fluoride, it can result in the disruption of enamel formation, leading to the appearance of mottled enamel. The severity of dental fluorosis can vary depending on the level of fluoride exposure. It's worth noting that dental fluorosis is primarily a cosmetic condition and does not usually cause any functional problems or pain. However, in severe cases, the enamel may become pitted or rough, and teeth may be more prone to staining and decay. Prevention of dental fluorosis involves several measures, such as using fluoride-containing products in appropriate amounts, teaching children to practice proper oral hygiene, and monitoring their fluoride intake from multiple sources. Dentists can also provide guidance on fluoride supplementation or the use of alternative sources of drinking water if necessary. In summary, the cause of mottled enamel, or dental fluorosis, is excessive exposure to fluoride during tooth development. Implementing preventive measures and maintaining proper oral hygiene can help minimize the risk of dental fluorosis. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the dose, duration, and age of the individual during the exposure. Dental fluorosis is characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation. In "very mild" fluorosis, less than 25% of the tooth surface is affected, with small, opaque, scattered white areas. Moderate fluorosis affects all tooth surfaces with mottled appearance, and brown stains may be present. The severity of fluorosis can vary among individuals based on the duration, timing, and dosage of fluoride exposure. It's worth noting that people with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria).

[2024-06-14 14:56:10,384] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Axon dysfunction 

 Vision provides opportunity for the brain to perceive and respond to changes occurring around the body. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, action potentials must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS. If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not 

 When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. The transduction of light into neural activity occurs via the photoreceptor cells in the retina. When a particle of light hits the photoreceptors of the eye, the two molecules come apart from each other and a chain of chemical reactions occurs. Finally, a message is sent to the ganglion cell and then finally the brain. Starting from the posterior (back) of the eye, we have the following layers:

1. Ganglion cell layer: This layer contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells, which are responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. The ganglion cells send their axons towards the posterior of the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the visual information to the brain for further processing and interpretation. These structures work together to capture, process, and transmit visual signals to the brain for perception. Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, 

 In the visual system, sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina convert the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain. The ganglion cell layer (ganglionic layer) is a layer of the retina that consists of retinal ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells. The cells are somewhat flask-shaped; the rounded internal surface of each resting on the stratum opticum, and sending off an axon which is prolonged into it. The ganglion cells vary much in size, and the dendrites of the smaller ones as a rule arborize in the inner plexiform layer as soon as they enter it; while those of the larger cells ramify close to the inner nuclear layer. The ganglion cells in the retina have an important function in processing visual information. Ganglion cells then transmit this visual information to the brain via their axons. The axons of ganglion cells are myelinated, meaning they are covered in a fatty substance called myelin. The axons of ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain. In terms of connectivity in the brain, the axons of ganglion cells primarily connect to a specific region called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From there, visual information is further processed and sent to other areas of the brain responsible for interpreting and perceiving vision. Overall, ganglion cells play a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to higher centers in the brain for further processing and interpretation. Reference:
- A ganglion cell (sometimes called a gangliocyte) is a type of neuron located in the retina of the eye that receives visual information from photoreceptors via various intermediate cells such as bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells. - These axons form the optic nerve and connect mainly to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the brain. The optic nerve plays a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. These impulses are then transmitted through the fibers of the optic nerve to various visual centers in the brain. It consists of several layers of interconnected neurons and is supported by pigmented epithelial cells. The neural signals generated by the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons in the retina before being transmitted to the brain. The output of these neurons takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells. These ganglion cells have axons that bundle together to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the electrical impulses generated by the retinal ganglion cells and transmits them to the brain. It is worth mentioning that the retina, including the optic nerve, is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. During vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, specifically the embryonic diencephalon. This close relationship between the retina and the brain enables the non-invasive visualization of the retina, providing valuable insights into the functioning of the central nervous system. Therefore, the optic nerve serves as a vital pathway through which visual information is transmitted from the retina to the brain, allowing us to perceive and make sense of the visual world.

2024-06-14 14:56:10 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Axon dysfunction 

 Vision provides opportunity for the brain to perceive and respond to changes occurring around the body. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, action potentials must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS. If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not 

 When we view an image, light passes through the cornea, and through the pupil, which is controlled by the iris. It then passes through the lens and is projected onto the retina at the back of the eye. The transduction of light into neural activity occurs via the photoreceptor cells in the retina. When a particle of light hits the photoreceptors of the eye, the two molecules come apart from each other and a chain of chemical reactions occurs. Finally, a message is sent to the ganglion cell and then finally the brain. Starting from the posterior (back) of the eye, we have the following layers:

1. Ganglion cell layer: This layer contains the cell bodies of the ganglion cells, which are responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. The ganglion cells send their axons towards the posterior of the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the visual information to the brain for further processing and interpretation. These structures work together to capture, process, and transmit visual signals to the brain for perception. Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. Axons are covered by a membrane known as an axolemma; the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm. Most axons branch, 

 In the visual system, sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina convert the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain. The ganglion cell layer (ganglionic layer) is a layer of the retina that consists of retinal ganglion cells and displaced amacrine cells. The cells are somewhat flask-shaped; the rounded internal surface of each resting on the stratum opticum, and sending off an axon which is prolonged into it. The ganglion cells vary much in size, and the dendrites of the smaller ones as a rule arborize in the inner plexiform layer as soon as they enter it; while those of the larger cells ramify close to the inner nuclear layer. The ganglion cells in the retina have an important function in processing visual information. Ganglion cells then transmit this visual information to the brain via their axons. The axons of ganglion cells are myelinated, meaning they are covered in a fatty substance called myelin. The axons of ganglion cells come together to form the optic nerve, which carries visual signals from the retina to the brain. In terms of connectivity in the brain, the axons of ganglion cells primarily connect to a specific region called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From there, visual information is further processed and sent to other areas of the brain responsible for interpreting and perceiving vision. Overall, ganglion cells play a crucial role in transmitting visual information from the retina to higher centers in the brain for further processing and interpretation. Reference:

However, Lead is toxic and is a possible carcinogen. In 1978, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the residential use of lead-based paint containing ≥0.06% lead (600 ppm). In 2017, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that approximately 35 percent of U.S. homes (37 million) still contain some lead-based paint, a decline from 1990 estimate of 64 million homes with lead paint. The Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, was a 1992 law passed by the US Congress that regulates the selling of houses with lead paint in the United States and educates consumers about the dangers of lead paint. The Act was enacted as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act

 Lead-based paint was widely used in the United States, because of its durability. The United States banned the manufacture of lead-based house paint in 1978 due to health concerns. Lead has long been considered to be a harmful environmental pollutant. Cited cases of lead poisoning date back to the early 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint "poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors." Congress banned the use of lead-based paint in residential structures and environments, in 1971, in residential projects constructed by, or with the assistance of, the federal government, and 

The buyer must receive a pamphlet that details information regarding lead paint and its potential hazards. ; If there is lead paint in the house, or if there is an apparent danger of lead poisoning from lead paint in the house, then that information must be disclosed to the buyer. If so, the seller is then required to provide to the buyer any previous documentation or reports on the condition of lead paint in the house. ; The buyer must be allowed ten days to request an evaluation of any lead paint in the house. Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10 µg/dl (10 µg/100 g) and for children at 3.5 µg/dl, previously before October 2021 5 µg/dl Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray. Lead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, state laws that ban the use of and national policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint, gasoline, ammunition, wheel weights, and fishing weights reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. There also are numerous cases in the developed world, with there being thousands of American communities with higher lead burdens than seen during the peak of the Flint water crisis. Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC, while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century. Concerns for low levels of exposure began in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure.

 The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier ( - literally, "Yellow Terrier") is a pure-breed terrier originating from Ireland. Wheatens are generally friendly and playful, and tend to get along well with children and other dogs. Puppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. It may also come out to a molten chocolate color, either white or milky colored fur. Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers are generally a long-lived breed. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong "prey drive" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens are friendly and loving pets, and get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. Many Wheaten owners thus say they make great watch dogs, but poor guard dogs. Wheatens are a great dog for children and are generally friendly towards them. According to the American College of Veterinary Surgeons although rare, one health issue which affects Ridgebacks more than other dogs is ‘dermoid sinus’.

The majority of Finnish Lapphunds are very healthy dogs, but they may be prone to hereditary health conditions, particularly joint and eye problems. Hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia are health issues that may affect a Finnish Lapphund. The Finnish Lapphund is somewhat prone to a variety of eye conditions, including cataracts. The majority of Finnish Lapphunds will not encounter these health problems, and they have an average lifespan of 12-15 years, considerably longer than the lifespan of most breeds their size. The Finnish Lapphund is an alert, friendly, and intelligent breed. Although they were bred to herd reindeer and are known for their courage, they are generally very calm and submissive with humans. The Finnish Lapphund gets along well with most people and animals. He will get along well with other dogs, as well as cats and smaller pets, if he is raised with them. The Finnish Lapphund is energetic and needs both physical and mental stimulation. A couple of long walks or high energy sessions daily are ideal for a Finnish Lapphund. With his strength and excellent stamina, the Finnish Lapphund is the perfect companion for a hike or run. If you do live in a warmer climate, be sure to monitor your Finnish Lapphund for overheating. The Finnish Lapphund does tend to bark a lot and has a strong startle reflex. Training can help reduce this problem, but the Finnish Lapphund is not a particularly quiet dog by nature.

Weight – Females: 7-9 lbs. Papillon pups are pint-sized, cheerful little purebreds that have overall good health. But there are a few serious health conditions that plague the breed. However, not all Papillon pups will develop a health issue in their lifetime. The same goes for many other health conditions that are prominent in the Papillon breed. There are also the usual illnesses that can affect any dog of any breed, such as heart disease and some kinds of cancer. Naturally gentle, lively, and friendly, the Papillon would make one of the best family pets, especially for families with children and other dogs. These pups are non-confrontational and affectionate, even towards most strangers. However, it would be best to rely on other pups to be watchdogs, as these purebreds would rather be sleeping with you at nighttime. While it would be a good idea to take these pups for a couple of short walks at least twice a day, the Papillon is a dog that would be just as happy snuggling on the couch for the afternoon. Their exercise needs are minimum, but they would love a quick romp and play in the backyard with your youngsters and other pups. Papillons are clever, agile, and alert with an innate eagerness to please their loved ones. Training sessions are easier with these pups than most other dogs because these purebreds pay close attention and grasp instructions quickly. The only training challenge you may face is housebreaking your Papillon. These purebreds love tricks and learning new ways to show their playful side to their loved ones, but house-training isn’t any fun to them.

The battles were fought on April 19, 1775 in Middlesex County, Province of Massachusetts Bay, within the towns of Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Menotomy (present-day Arlington), and Cambridge. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the 

  Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the British garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their leaders, leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775. About 700 British Army regulars in Boston, under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith, were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord. The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington. Eight militiamen were killed, including Ensign Robert Munroe, their third in command. The militia was outnumbered and fell back, and 

 April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at Concord. Several riders — including Paul Revere — alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered Lexington on the morning of April 19, they found 77 minutemen formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord. At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies. Eight Lexington men were killed, and ten were wounded. The eight colonists killed were John Brown, Samuel Hadley, Caleb Harrington, Jonathon Harrington, Robert Munroe, Isaac Muzzey, Asahel Porter, and Jonas Parker. Upon returning to Lexington, Lt. Col. Smith's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under Brigadier General Hugh Percy, a future Duke of Northumberland styled at this time by the courtesy title Earl Percy. The combined force of about 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown. Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall, but this has been discredited. Yet another theory is that the 

  In the morning, Boston was surrounded by a huge militia army, numbering over 15,000, which had marched from throughout New England. Now under the leadership of General Artemas Ward, who arrived on the 20th and replaced Brigadier General William Heath, they formed a siege line extending from Chelsea, around the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown, to Roxbury, effectively surrounding Boston on three sides. In the days immediately following, the size of the colonial forces grew, as militias from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut arrived on 

 appearing and thought that the militia would not interfere if they sent a sizable force to Concord to seize munitions and stores there (which they considered the King's property, since it was paid for to defend the colonies from the American Indian threat). Shooting erupted at Lexington. The British then moved to Concord and faced a larger number of militia.

The militia was outnumbered and fell back, and 

 April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at Concord. Several riders — including Paul Revere — alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered Lexington on the morning of April 19, they found 77 minutemen formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord. At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies. Eight Lexington men were killed, and ten were wounded. The eight colonists killed were John Brown, Samuel Hadley, Caleb Harrington, Jonathon Harrington, Robert Munroe, Isaac Muzzey, Asahel Porter, and Jonas Parker. Upon returning to Lexington, Lt. Col. Smith's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under Brigadier General Hugh Percy, a future Duke of Northumberland styled at this time by the courtesy title Earl Percy. The combined force of about 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown. Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall, but this has been discredited. Yet another theory is that the 

  In the morning, Boston was surrounded by a huge militia army, numbering over 15,000, which had marched from throughout New England. Now under the leadership of General Artemas Ward, who arrived on the 20th and replaced Brigadier General William Heath, they formed a siege line extending from Chelsea, around the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown, to Roxbury, effectively surrounding Boston on three sides. In the days immediately following, the size of the colonial forces grew, as militias from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut arrived on 

 appearing and thought that the militia would not interfere if they sent a sizable force to Concord to seize munitions and stores there (which they considered the King's property, since it was paid for to defend the colonies from the American Indian threat). Shooting erupted at Lexington. The British then moved to Concord and faced a larger number of militia.

[2024-06-14 14:56:15,525] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: the main function of the pulmonary system. The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Throughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. The systemic circuit transports oxygen to the body and returns relatively de-oxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the pulmonary circuit. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Broadly speaking, branches from the ascending aorta supply the heart; branches from the aortic arch supply the head, neck, and arms; branches from the thoracic descending aorta supply the chest (excluding the heart and the respiratory zone of the lung); and branches from the abdominal aorta supply the abdomen. The pelvis and legs get their blood from the common iliac arteries. While both systems involve the flow of blood, they differ in their purpose and function. Its primary function is to oxygenate the blood. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart and is then pumped into the right ventricle. In the lungs, the exchange of gases occurs, with carbon dioxide being expelled and oxygen being absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium before being pumped into the systemic circulation. Oxygenated blood from the left atrium enters the left ventricle, which then pumps it into the main artery of the body, the aorta. From the aorta, the blood is distributed through a network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the veins, entering the right atrium to complete the cycle. One key distinction between pulmonary and systemic circulation is the blood pressure within the two systems. The pressure in the pulmonary circulation is significantly lower compared to the systemic circulation. This constriction helps redirect blood flow from poorly ventilated areas of the lungs to well-ventilated regions, optimizing gas exchange. The two circulatory systems differ in their purpose, blood pressure, and unique regulatory mechanisms. In the heart, there are two main pathways for blood circulation: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. During pulmonary circulation, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart from the body via the inferior and superior venae cavae and enters the right atrium. From there, it flows into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs for oxygenation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released, and oxygen is absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium. Systemic circulation begins when oxygenated blood enters the left atrium from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. From the aorta, the oxygenated blood is distributed to the rest of the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. As the oxygen is used up and waste products are produced, deoxygenated blood returns to the heart via the veins and the process of circulation begins again. To facilitate these pathways and maintain the structure of the heart, there is a fibrous skeleton composed of fibrous rings and trigones. It begins when deoxygenated blood is pumped from the right side of the heart, specifically the right ventricle, into the pulmonary artery. In the capillaries, gas exchange occurs, where carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is added. Oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through the pulmonary veins and returns to the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium, to be pumped out to the rest of the body. It begins when oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart, specifically the left ventricle, through the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. In the capillaries, nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the tissues, while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up. One key difference between pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation is the amount of resistance encountered by each circuit. The pulmonary circulation has a lower resistance compared to the systemic circulation. This is important as it allows for optimal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, that occurs in the capillaries of the lungs. The pressure within the pulmonary circulation is much lower compared to the systemic circulation. By understanding these differences, we can appreciate the complexity and efficiency of the cardiovascular system. The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs via the four pulmonary veins.The left side of the heart pumps blood through the high-pressure systemic circulation.The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation via the pulmonary arteries.It is surrounded by a tough fibrous sac, the pericardium, which also contains the beginnings and ends of the great vessels entering and leaving the heart. The right side of the heart pumps blood through pulmonary circulation. The left side of the heart pumps blood through systemic circulation.

Question: how oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:56:15 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: the main function of the pulmonary system. The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Throughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins, passes through the bicuspid valve into the left ventricle, and is then pumped into the aorta through the aortic valve for distribution to the body's tissues. The systemic circuit transports oxygen to the body and returns relatively de-oxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the pulmonary circuit. - Blood flows through the heart in one direction, from the atria to the ventricles, and out through the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary circulation, and the aorta into the systemic circulation. Broadly speaking, branches from the ascending aorta supply the heart; branches from the aortic arch supply the head, neck, and arms; branches from the thoracic descending aorta supply the chest (excluding the heart and the respiratory zone of the lung); and branches from the abdominal aorta supply the abdomen. The pelvis and legs get their blood from the common iliac arteries. While both systems involve the flow of blood, they differ in their purpose and function. Its primary function is to oxygenate the blood. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium of the heart and is then pumped into the right ventricle. In the lungs, the exchange of gases occurs, with carbon dioxide being expelled and oxygen being absorbed by the blood. The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and enters the left atrium before being pumped into the systemic circulation.

Contrary to the claim, raising the minimum retirement age for women is disregarding the double - even triple - journey they face. As a general rule, the minimum age for women would increase from 60 to 62 years. For rural workers, the minimum age would change from 55 to 60 years. Also, in the teacher categories, the Social Security proposal increases the minimum age of women by seven. Most Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. During most of the postwar period, that age was 55. Because government social security payments normally begin at age 60, workers are forced to find reemployment to fill the five-year gap. However, in 1986 the Japanese Diet passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60. Many Japanese companies raised the retirement age they had set, partly

The minimum retirement age will be 62 for women and 65 for men for both private and servants. system in 1986 by cutting benefit levels and raising the plan's specified age at which benefits began from 60 to 65. Under the revised system, contributions paid in equal share by employer and employee were expected to be equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system. However, problems then arose in securing employment opportunities for the 60-to-65 age group. In 1990 some 90% of companies paid retirement benefits to their employees in the form of lump-sum payments and pensions. The proposal provides for a minimum age of 65 for men and 62 for women, and 30% of the remaining contribution time to retire under the old rules. Today the minimum age is 60 years old minimum age for men and women with 35 years of contribution. The second alternative would affect only new applicants for disability compensation. Most of the savings would result from curtailing payments to current recipients of disability compensation. The option would result in about 1,200 fewer of those cases in 2028, CBO estimates. Savings from the second alternative, in which only new applicants for disability compensation would be ineligible to receive payments for the seven conditions, would be about $4 billion over the 2020–2028 period, CBO estimates. The largest source of uncertainty in estimating the savings from this option is the estimate of the population receiving benefit payments

 For those who are against Social Security reform, the government's proposal to establish the minimum age as the sole criterion for retirement disregards the different life expectations within Brazil. In this sense, the minimum age of 62 for women and 65 for men proposed by the current government is very high and close to the average life expectancy of some states. In addition, increasing the minimum contribution time to 20 years for men is disregarding the Brazilian reality - marked by informal work especially for people with lower education and income - and hindering access to retirement. Today, 15% of workers cannot contribute enough to retire. Another strategy is to encourage individuals to save more for their retirement. This can help alleviate the strain on public pension systems and ensure individuals have sufficient funds to support themselves in old age. Increasing the number of years worked by raising the age of retirement is a commonly considered strategy. As people are living longer and healthier lives, extending the working years can contribute to increased productivity and economic output. However, this must be implemented carefully, considering factors such as the physical and cognitive capacity of individuals to continue working and ensuring opportunities for older workers in the job market. Another potential strategy involves leveraging the voluntary nonmonetary contributions of the retired. By considering factors such as productivity, savings, consumption, retirement age, voluntary contributions, and immigration, countries can develop comprehensive approaches that promote economic sustainability while supporting the well-being of older individuals. But no single one of these measures can bear the full load of adaptation to population aging, since the changes would have to be so severe and disruptive as to be politically impossible.Pressures to increase retirement ages in industrialized countries and to reduce benefits are increasing.In other words, while in crude terms there are today 4 workers supporting the pensions and other costs of each older person, by 2050 there will only be 2. There are only so many ways to meet the challenge of an extended period of dependency, including increasing the productivity of those in the labor force, saving more, reducing consumption, increasing the number of years worked by increasing the age of retirement, increasing the voluntary nonmonetary productive contributions of the retired, and immigration of very large numbers of young workers into the “old” countries.

Inflammation is a side-effect and a forerunner of aging and degenerative dis-ease. From the time Jill was a child, she suffered recurring sinus infections, earache, colds and flu. Sugar, soda and sweets played a significant role in Jill’s diet along with cereal grains, rice and potatoes. Jill craved sweets, snacked constantly and ate often. Instead, Jill was told to use an inhaler and was given steroids. When Jill’s menstrual cycle began, she suffered amenorrhea [irregular periods] sometimes skipping several months. Jill saw improvement, but after a few months, the problem returned followed by a persistent bronchial cough low energy and weight gain. Soon thereafter, Jill’s menstrual cycle included problematic, tender, lumpy breasts [fibroid tumors] and occasionally, cysts on her ovaries. Her mother took Jill to a psychiatrist who diagnosed her, schizophrenic and bi-polar and put her on psychotropic drugs. Now, Jill suffered the social stigma of being a mental case. At age 18, Jill became sexually active and began using birth control pills. Birth control pills caused Jill’s menstrual and hormonal issues to compound in the form of chronic bladder and vaginal infections [so-called], heavy depression, imaginary voices and intense anxiety. Jill married at age 20 and became pregnant soon after. Like Jill, the little girl had learning problems at school and suffered from so-called, attention deficit disorder (ADD). Jill’s diet was heavy in carbohydrates and sugar; sodas and fruit juice were staples. Both Jill and her husband drank. Jill favored wine; she had been told [wrongly!] Angie Harmon as Jane Clementine Rizzoli: a Boston detective in the Homicide Unit. From an Italian American family, Jane is brash, sarcastic, and often prickly but also a confident and independent woman as well as a brilliant detective. She is extremely competitive, especially with her younger brother, Frankie (also a cop), who is often caught in her shadow. Jane can tackle a perp like a linebacker. She locates the woman, who is living under an alias, and, while she does confront her, Stella does not immediately cuff her, but gives her a day to flee. It is unknown how much she later reveals to Detective Valens (episode 322, "Cold Reveal"). Stella and her colleagues attempt to defend Mac Taylor on the stand after the senior CSI comes under fire 

Jill, 16, learned from genetic testing at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) that she had Kallmann syndrome. Dr. Vogiatzi ordered several tests, including an MRI of Jill’s brain to check if her pituitary or hypothalamus looked abnormal, but unfortunately nothing was conclusive. When it hadn’t, Dr. Vogiatzi referred Jill to Louisa Pyle, MD, PhD, and Emma Bedoukian, MS, of the Differences of Sexual Development and Endogenetics Clinic, within the Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center (RIMGC). The genetic testing results confirmed their and Dr. Vogiatzi’s suspicions, based on Jill’s missing sense of smell; she had Kallmann syndrome. Jill didn’t have those symptoms. People with FGFR1 mutations may have any range of puberty from normal to start-and-stall puberty (as was the case with Jill) to no hint of sexual development, which is called complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. The genetic testing allowed Dr. Vogiatzi to tailor Jill’s treatment. Vogiatzi says the chances are strong that Jill will be able to have children in the future, with the help of medication. The treatment certainly isn’t slowing Jill down, either. As a high school junior, she has continued her sports and music activities plus volunteered

To ensure proper nutrition and hydration for a recovering jill, there are several steps that should be taken. Firstly, once the jill has recovered from anesthesia, it is important to force-feed concentrated nutritional supplements hourly. If the jill has experienced toxemia due to a change in diet, it is recommended to offer her original diet mixed with warm water to create a porridge. In the case of a mildly toxemic jill within 24 hours of her due date, prostaglandin and oxytocin can be used to induce parturition. Remember, these steps are based on general guidelines for providing proper nutrition and hydration to a recovering jill. The article deals with the series' main, recurring, and minor characters.

When Med first premiered, he was Chief Resident. Charge Nurse Maggie Lockwood, who sometimes uses the nickname "Big Red" when referring to Dr. Halstead, once described him as "a slightly anal, overly stubborn, rule breaking, control freak". Dr. Halstead's relationship with hospital administrator Sharon Goodwin has been historically fraught, and Halstead's job has been jeopardized on multiple occasions. In season 1 Dr. Halstead clashes a number of times with Dr. Connor Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and Sharon Goodwin, the chief administrator, over hospital practices and policies. He particularly disliked Dr. Rhodes as he felt the latter was an entitled "rich kid" from the more affluent northern suburbs. They eventually call an unspoken truce by the end of the season as they developed a mutual professional respect for one another.

2024-06-14 14:56:16 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: The team investigates the murder of a marine who was beaten to death in his backyard. They find out his Marine wife Georgia Wooten (Christina Cox) was abused and that the husband had an affair. She is initially suspected and remains uncooperative throughout the investigation. At one point, Ducky suggests sending Ziva to talk to Wooten, noting that the former had "been through things you and I can't even imagine" and knew how it felt to be controlled, and was therefore the only one who could relate. Gibbs is reluctant to open Ziva's old wounds but ultimately complies. The team finds numerous suspects, including the murder victim's pregnant girlfriend, but eventually 

 and hard to win the respect of her colleagues, but it is her relationship with her equally stubborn mother, Angela Rizzoli, that sometimes proves to be her biggest headache. During her time on the force, she had a traumatic experience at the hands of a serial killer known as "The Surgeon", Charles Hoyt. She has matching scars in the center of her palms where Hoyt stabbed her with scalpels, keeping her pinned to the ground. Her original partner, Vince Korsak, saved her life, and Jane 

 Mary Giordano (Alicia Silverstone) is a beautiful and intelligent Catholic-school senior in Burlingame, California. All of this has inspired her to become a police officer, like her father who was slain in the line of duty years ago. She launches her own investigation, which gets her in trouble with her late dad's partner, Detective Jerry Guinn (Bill Nunn). Philadelphia Homicide gets a hit for it in a cold case involving some bloody clothes found buried along a highway. The Cold Case Squad sends out Detective Scotty Valens (played by 

Inflammation is a side-effect and a forerunner of aging and degenerative dis-ease. From the time Jill was a child, she suffered recurring sinus infections, earache, colds and flu. Sugar, soda and sweets played a significant role in Jill’s diet along with cereal grains, rice and potatoes. Jill craved sweets, snacked constantly and ate often. Instead, Jill was told to use an inhaler and was given steroids. When Jill’s menstrual cycle began, she suffered amenorrhea [irregular periods] sometimes skipping several months. Jill saw improvement, but after a few months, the problem returned followed by a persistent bronchial cough low energy and weight gain. Soon thereafter, Jill’s menstrual cycle included problematic, tender, lumpy breasts [fibroid tumors] and occasionally, cysts on her ovaries. Her mother took Jill to a psychiatrist who diagnosed her, schizophrenic and bi-polar and put her on psychotropic drugs. Now, Jill suffered the social stigma of being a mental case. At age 18, Jill became sexually active and began using birth control pills. Birth control pills caused Jill’s menstrual and hormonal issues to compound in the form of chronic bladder and vaginal infections [so-called], heavy depression, imaginary voices and intense anxiety. Jill married at age 20 and became pregnant soon after. Like Jill, the little girl had learning problems at school and suffered from so-called, attention deficit disorder (ADD). Jill’s diet was heavy in carbohydrates and sugar; sodas and fruit juice were staples. Both Jill and her husband drank. Jill favored wine; she had been told [wrongly!] Angie Harmon as Jane Clementine Rizzoli: a Boston detective in the Homicide Unit. From an Italian American family, Jane is brash, sarcastic, and often prickly but also a confident and independent woman as well as a brilliant detective. She is extremely competitive, especially with her younger brother, Frankie (also a cop), who is often caught in her shadow. Jane can tackle a perp like a linebacker. She locates the woman, who is living under an alias, and, while she does confront her, Stella does not immediately cuff her, but gives her a day to flee. It is unknown how much she later reveals to Detective Valens (episode 322, "Cold Reveal"). Stella and her colleagues attempt to defend Mac Taylor on the stand after the senior CSI comes under fire 

Jill, 16, learned from genetic testing at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) that she had Kallmann syndrome. Dr. Vogiatzi ordered several tests, including an MRI of Jill’s brain to check if her pituitary or hypothalamus looked abnormal, but unfortunately nothing was conclusive. When it hadn’t, Dr. Vogiatzi referred Jill to Louisa Pyle, MD, PhD, and Emma Bedoukian, MS, of the Differences of Sexual Development and Endogenetics Clinic, within the Roberts Individualized Medical Genetics Center (RIMGC). The genetic testing results confirmed their and Dr. Vogiatzi’s suspicions, based on Jill’s missing sense of smell; she had Kallmann syndrome. Jill didn’t have those symptoms. People with FGFR1 mutations may have any range of puberty from normal to start-and-stall puberty (as was the case with Jill) to no hint of sexual development, which is called complete gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. The genetic testing allowed Dr. Vogiatzi to tailor Jill’s treatment. Vogiatzi says the chances are strong that Jill will be able to have children in the future, with the help of medication. The treatment certainly isn’t slowing Jill down, either. As a high school junior, she has continued her sports and music activities plus volunteered

To ensure proper nutrition and hydration for a recovering jill, there are several steps that should be taken. Firstly, once the jill has recovered from anesthesia, it is important to force-feed concentrated nutritional supplements hourly. If the jill has experienced toxemia due to a change in diet, it is recommended to offer her original diet mixed with warm water to create a porridge. In the case of a mildly toxemic jill within 24 hours of her due date, prostaglandin and oxytocin can be used to induce parturition. Remember, these steps are based on general guidelines for providing proper nutrition and hydration to a recovering jill. The article deals with the series' main, recurring, and minor characters. Main Overview Notes Dr. Will Halstead Portrayed by Nick Gehlfuss Dr. Will Halstead is an attending in the Emergency Department. episode "Say Her Real Name" as Detective Jay Halstead's estranged brother who drops by to visit in a two-episode arc. The character moved to Med after being introduced in the show's backdoor pilot on Chicago Fire and Gehlfuss was made a regular cast member when the characters at Chicago Medical Center who appeared in both Fire and P.D. When Med first premiered, he was Chief Resident. Charge Nurse Maggie Lockwood, who sometimes uses the nickname "Big Red" when referring to Dr. Halstead, once described him as "a slightly anal, overly stubborn, rule breaking, control freak". Dr. Halstead's relationship with hospital administrator Sharon Goodwin has been historically fraught, and Halstead's job has been jeopardized on multiple occasions. In season 1 Dr. Halstead clashes a number of times with Dr. Connor Rhodes, a trauma surgery fellow, and Sharon Goodwin, the chief administrator, over hospital practices and policies. He particularly disliked Dr. Rhodes as he felt the latter was an entitled "rich kid" from the more affluent northern suburbs.

The headwaters of the Apurímac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazon's most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the headwaters of the Mantaro River on the Cordillera Rumi Cruz in Peru.

 American States (OAS) reports that between 2016 and May 2018, 4,738 Venezuelans arrived in Paraguay. Paraguay is bounded by Bolivia to the northwest and north, Brazil to the northeast and east, and Argentina to the southeast, south, and west. The Paraguay River, which runs from north to south, divides Paraguay into two distinct geographic regions—the Región Oriental (Eastern Region) and the Región Occidental (Western Region), also called the Chaco Boreal. Triángulo Dionisio Foianini (Dionisio Foianini Triangle) is the name given to Bolivia's border with Brazil and Paraguay. Its importance lies in the fact that this border is marked in part by the Paraguay River and, as a result, Bolivia has a water route to the Atlantic Ocean that does not involve Brazil. Currently Bolivian ships must pass along the eleven kilometre Tamengo Canal which connects Laguna Cáceres to the Paraguay River at the Brazilian city of Corumbá. Although the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the Solimões das Águas. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the Solimões and its tributaries, are called the "Upper Amazon". The Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Perú. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Marañón and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. Above the rapids the river is navigable to Chimore, at the foot of the sierra, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances. In 1874, Franz Keller gave the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and not including the Guapore, as 41,459 cm3/sec (2,530 cub. per second), and the area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guapore, as 24,299 km2 (9,382 square miles). It borders on some large flooded grasslands and savannas, including the Paraná flooded savanna along the lower Paraná and Paraguay rivers, the Pantanal to the north, and the Southern Cone Mesopotamian savanna to the southeast between the Paraná and Uruguay rivers. Taking into account its length only, the Guapay should be considered the upper part of the Mamore; but it is shallow and obstructed, and carries a much smaller volume of water.

 The statue, entitled Liberty Enlightening the World, was a gift from the people of France to mark the American Centennial. The cornerstone was laid on August 5, 1884, and after some funding delays, construction of the pedestal was finished on April 22, 1886. The statue arrived in New York Harbor on June 17, 1885, on board the French frigate Isère, was stored for eleven months in crates waiting for its pedestal to be finished, and was then reassembled in four months. On October 28, 1886, the Statue of Liberty was unveiled by President Grover Cleveland. The painting inspired Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's Liberty Enlightening the World, known as the Statue of Liberty in New York City, which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after Liberty Leading the People was painted. A piece of steel from the original World Trade Center is embedded in the base. The $750,000 cost of statue was donated by hundreds of private citizens, including some survivors of the September 11 attacks. The statue was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero. An original feature is the bronze pedestal, which represents the famous Liberty Bell, the height being 9 feet with a diameter of nearly 10 feet. The statue symbolizing Liberty shows the Goddess of Liberty starting forward bursting the chains from her arms. Its most notable feature is the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World), a large statue by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi that was dedicated in 1886.

 As part of the Strengthening the Arm of Liberty campaign to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), hundreds of scale replicas of the Statue of Liberty have been created nationwide. The Statue of Liberty, by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, bears the classical appearance of the Roman stola, sandals, and facial expression which are derived from Libertas, ancient Rome's goddess of freedom from slavery, oppression, and tyranny.

The painting inspired Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's Liberty Enlightening the World, known as the Statue of Liberty in New York City, which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after Liberty Leading the People was painted. A piece of steel from the original World Trade Center is embedded in the base. The $750,000 cost of statue was donated by hundreds of private citizens, including some survivors of the September 11 attacks. The statue was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero. An original feature is the bronze pedestal, which represents the famous Liberty Bell, the height being 9 feet with a diameter of nearly 10 feet. The statue symbolizing Liberty shows the Goddess of Liberty starting forward bursting the chains from her arms. Its most notable feature is the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World), a large statue by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi that was dedicated in 1886. The island also contains the Statue of Liberty Museum, which opened in 2019 and exhibits the statue's original torch. West 10th Street ; 28) *Also see: Statue of Liberty, Liberty Island ; 29) * The Statue of Liberty was said to be modeled after the mother of French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi. She is also remembered by a plaque at the northwest end of Battery Park which was donated in 1955 by the Federation 

 As part of the Strengthening the Arm of Liberty campaign to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), hundreds of scale replicas of the Statue of Liberty have been created nationwide. The Statue of Liberty, by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, bears the classical appearance of the Roman stola, sandals, and facial expression which are derived from Libertas, ancient Rome's goddess of freedom from slavery, oppression, and tyranny.

The Ohio River drains portions of eight states, including, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia. At its widest point, it is one mile wide at Smithland dam. The Mississippi River System, also referred to as the Western Rivers, is a mostly riverine network of the United States which includes the Mississippi River and connecting waterways. The Mississippi River is the largest drainage basin in the United States. In the United States, the Mississippi drains about fifty-nine percent of the country's rivers. From the perspective of natural geography and hydrology, the system consists of the Mississippi River itself and its numerous natural tributaries and distributaries. The major tributaries are the Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio and Red rivers.

 The Illinois River is a principal tributary of the Mississippi River. The river runs approximately 273 miles (439 km) long, in the U.S. state of Illinois. This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The Illinois River meets the Mississippi at Pere Marquette State Park, which is near Grafton. The Illinois River is relatively shallow, just like the Mississippi. In addition, the Illinois River is a "managed" river, just as the Mississippi River is. The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the "Point" of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio 

  The Lower Mississippi River is the portion of the Mississippi River downstream of Cairo, Illinois. From the confluence of the Ohio River and Upper Mississippi River at Cairo, the Lower flows just under 1000 miles (1600 km) to the Gulf of Mexico. It is the most heavily travelled component of the Mississippi River System. About 850 miles of the river is navigable, from Minneapolis-St. Paul to the Ohio River.

 The Illinois River is a principal tributary of the Mississippi River. The river runs approximately 273 miles (439 km) long, in the U.S. state of Illinois. This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The Illinois River meets the Mississippi at Pere Marquette State Park, which is near Grafton. The Illinois River is relatively shallow, just like the Mississippi. In addition, the Illinois River is a "managed" river, just as the Mississippi River is. The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the "Point" of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio 

  The Lower Mississippi River is the portion of the Mississippi River downstream of Cairo, Illinois. From the confluence of the Ohio River and Upper Mississippi River at Cairo, the Lower flows just under 1000 miles (1600 km) to the Gulf of Mexico. It is the most heavily travelled component of the Mississippi River System. About 850 miles of the river is navigable, from Minneapolis-St. Paul to the Ohio River.

Ancient sources provide a wealth of interpretations of Odysseus' wanderings, with a complex range of traditions which affect one another in various ways. The geography of the Apologoi (the tale that Odysseus told to the Phaeacians, forming books 9-12 of the Odyssey), and the location of the Phaeacians' own island of Scheria, pose quite different problems from those encountered in identifying Troy, Mycenae, Pylos and Ithaca. For these reasons, the opinions of later students and scholars about the geography of Odysseus's travels vary enormously. In the Odyssey, Homer gives him the epithet "the peer of murderous Ares". When King Alcinous orders him to make amends, he gives Odysseus a bronze sword with a silver hilt and an ivory sheath. Events in the main sequence of the Odyssey (excluding the narrative of Odysseus's adventures) take place in the Peloponnese and in what are now called the Ionian Islands (Ithaca and its neighbours). However, scholars both ancient and modern are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after Ismaros and before his return to Ithaca) were real. The geographer Strabo and many others came down squarely on the skeptical side: he reported what the great geographer Eratosthenes had said in the late 3rd century BC: "You will find the scene of Odysseus's wanderings when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds." A minority view is that the landfalls of Odysseus were inspired by places on a much shorter itinerary along the coast of Greece itself. One of the earliest to suggest any locations here was the 2nd century AD geographer Pausanias who, in his Description of Greece, suggested that the nekyia took place at the river Acheron in north west Greece, where the Necromanteion was subsequently built. However the location was overlooked or dismissed by many subsequently, until the archaeologist Sotirios Dakaris excavated the site, beginning in 1958. It was located on a rocky plateau above the left bank of the Asopos River, at the point where it leaves Mount Oeta for the plain of Lamia. In Odyssey 8, Odysseus lands on the island of the Phaeacians. During Odysseus' time there, the Phaeacians stage a series of athletic contests for Odysseus so that he could spread stories about the Phaeacians' athletic prowess. After declining the offer, one Phaeacian, Euryalos, joked that Odysseus did not have the skills to compete in an athletic competition. The next morning, Odysseus washes ashore and is found by some Phaeacians girls. With help from Phaeacian King Alcinous (Jeroen Krabbé), they help Odysseus back to Ithaca. They deliver him at night while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. Upon awakening the next morning, he finds himself on Ithaca where is reunited with Telemachus. In Book 9 of the Odyssey, Odysseus describes to his hosts the Phaeacians his encounter with the Cyclops Polyphemus. Having just left the land of the Lotus-eaters, Odysseus says "Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes". Homer had already (Book 6) described the Cyclopes as "men overweening in pride who plundered [their neighbors the Phaeacians] continually", driving the Phaeacians from their home. In Book 9, Homer gives a more detailed description of the Cyclopes as: "an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich

Many extreme presbyopes complain that their arms have become "too short" to hold reading material at a comfortable distance.

 Zacharias Janssen and/or his father, Hans Martens,  claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, and claims it was invented by expatriate Cornelis Drebbel who was noted to have a version in London in 1619. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name "microscope" was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625. The cornea and lens bend or refract light rays so they can be focused on the retina, the nerve layer that lines the back of the eye. The retina receives the picture formed by these light rays and sends the image to the brain through the optic nerve. Myopia (nearsightedness) occurs when light rays are focused in front of the retina instead of directly on the retina. Myopia is a vision problem experienced by approximately one-third of the population. The more myopic the eye, the closer an object must be before it is in sharp focus. Nearsighted people have difficulty seeing objects at a distance, such as highway signs, but usually can see up-close for tasks such as reading or sewing. Some people with myopia can use their natural nearsightedness to read without glasses at an age when other people must wear reading glasses. Hyperopia or farsightedness occurs when light rays are not bent enough to focus on the retina. Hyperopia is a common vision problem, affecting about one-fourth of the population. If the eye is too short from front to back, light rays reach the retina before they converge (focus).

If the eye is too short from front to back, light rays reach the retina before they converge (focus).

By addressing public health concerns, conducting research, and providing healthcare services, the PHS and its associated agencies contribute to the well-being of individuals and communities in the United States and worldwide. The role of the Assistant Secretary for Health in the United States Public Health Service (PHS) is to oversee the PHS and provide leadership and guidance in matters related to public health. The Assistant Secretary for Health is responsible for ensuring the implementation of public health policies and programs, coordinating activities among PHS agencies, and advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The PHS is a collection of agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, and it includes eight of the department's eleven operating divisions. These divisions cover various aspects of public health, such as the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and Indian Health Service, among others. The Assistant Secretary for Health plays a crucial role in coordinating the efforts of these agencies to address public health challenges, promote disease prevention and control, and improve the overall health and well-being of the American population. They work closely with other federal, state, and local agencies, as well as public and private organizations, to develop and implement effective public health policies and strategies. In 1995, PHS agencies were shifted to report directly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, rather than the Assistant Secretary for Health, which eliminated PHS as an administrative level in the organizational hierarchy. In summary, the Assistant Secretary for Health in the United States Public Health Service plays a vital role in overseeing the PHS, coordinating public health efforts, and advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services on matters related to public health. Their work is essential in promoting and protecting the health of the American population.

The permanent members were all allies in World War II (and the victors of that war), and are also all states with nuclear weapons (though only the United States had developed nuclear weapons prior to the formation of the United Nations). The remaining 10 members of the council are elected by the General Assembly, giving a total of 15 UN member states. All five permanent members have the power of veto, which enables any one of them to prevent the adoption of any "substantive" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support. The five permanent members of the Security Council were the victorious powers in World War II and have maintained the world's most powerful military forces ever since. The United Nations Security Council "veto power" refers to the power of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to veto any "substantive" resolution. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors. Supporters regard it as a promoter of international stability, a check against military interventions, and a critical safeguard against US domination. Critics say that the veto is the most undemocratic element of the UN, as well as the main cause of inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity, as it effectively prevents UN action against the permanent members and their allies. The UN currently has five permanent members with veto power in the Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – comprising the victors of World War II.

China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since 1970, is the only country on the "Top 10 Movers" list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Yet it was not among the region's top performers in improving school enrollment 

 The average head-and-body length of the male is 55 cm, with a range of 46 to 68 cm, while the female averages 52 cm with a range of 41 to 55 cm. In some regions, no difference in size is seen between males and females. The tail is about 30 cm long in both sexes. The height at the shoulder is 25 to 30 cm. On average males weigh 3.5 kg, with a range of 3.2 to 9.4 kg, while females average 2.9 kg, with a range of 1.4 to 3.2 kg. All people with hypochondroplasia have short stature. The adult height for men with this condition ranges from 138 centimeters to 165 centimeters (4 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 5 inches). The height range for adult women is 128 centimeters to 151 centimeters (4 feet, 2 inches to 4 feet, 11 inches). People with hypochondroplasia have short arms and legs and broad, short hands and feet. Other characteristic features include a large head, limited range of motion at the elbows, a sway of the lower back (lordosis), and bowed legs. These signs are generally less pronounced than those seen with achondroplasia and may not be noticeable until early or middle childhood.

Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder. It also has genetic similarities to thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. It affects both males and females, with female patients having an average height of 4 feet and ½ inches (123 centimeters) and male patients having an average height of 4 feet and 3½ inches (131 centimeters). The signs of achondroplasia include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base, and narrow foramen magnum. Primarily an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, achondroplasia is one of the common causes of dwarfism. Individuals suffering from this medical condition usually have short stature. For female patients, the average height is 4-feet and ½-inches or 123 centimeters. On the other hand, the average height for male patients is 4-feet and 3½-inches or 131 centimeters. According to their findings, this type of dwarfism resulted from the mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene, which is part of the human chromosome 4. In addition, it also shares similar presentations with other diseases like thanatophoric dysplasia as well as osteoporosis. Based on a number of studies, its prevalence is only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. The signs include large intervertebral disk height, small skull base as well as narrow foramen magnum. Good thing there are certain procedures available that can somehow enhance the overall appearance of patients. The shortest person ever recorded with this condition was Jyoti Amge of India, who only stands at 58-centimeters or 23-inches tall and weighs around 5-kilograms or 11-pounds. Most of the time, individuals suffering from this medical condition are obese, mainly because of their short stature. Scientists have looked at whether height increases or decreases risk of cardiovascular diseases for decades. For instance, research suggests taller people suffer more from a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, as well as Marfan syndrome (a connective tissue and collagen disorder), which can come with heart valve problems and abnormalities of the aorta. Being short also seems to come with risks. A study from 2015 found that shorter people suffer coronary artery disease more often. “Growth during this period of childhood is not significantly associated with either of these stroke subtypes, suggesting that underlying mechanisms linking height with risks of stroke may exert their influence already by early childhood,” wrote the stroke study authors. The research looked at data on more than 300,000 Danish schoolchildren born over nearly six decades. Researchers noted that boys and girls who were 2 to 3 inches shorter than average when they were between ages 7 and 13 were at increased risk during their adult years of clot-related, or ischemic, stroke in both sexes and of bleeding, or hemorrhagic, stroke in men. Despite studies over many decades looking at height and health, there’s still a lot unknown about how the two intersect. What is considered “short” or “tall” varies by study with consideration to the population and gender being studied. There also is usually a midpoint height used based on the research. In the stroke study, the average height at age 7 was about 4 feet for both boys and girls. Is it height or is it an environmental factor, such as nutrition, that made the difference? In 2010, a meta-analysis of 52 studies involving more than 3 million men and women found that shorter people had a higher risk of having deadly heart disease than tall people. But Dr. Jaakko Tuomilehto of the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki in Finland and author of the editorial “Tall is beautiful and heart-healthy?” published in 2010 in European Heart Journal didn’t stop there, suggesting everyone model healthy behaviors. “On the other hand, tall people are not protected against coronary heart disease, and they also need to pay attention to the same risk factors as shorter people,” he wrote. Eugenia calycina grows up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) in height, although is normally between 0.7 meters (2 feet) and 1.5 meters (5 feet). The narrow, coriaceous leaves are evergreen and elliptic in shape. These estimates are outside the range of normal modern human height and considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the smallest modern humans, such as the Mbenga and Mbuti at 1.5 m, Twa, Semang at 1.37 m for adult women of the Malay Peninsula, or the Andamanese at also 1.37 m for adult women.

[2024-06-14 14:56:29,797] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. In contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can be captured on camera, since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer's location. What the image appears to represent, however, is determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water. Mirages can be categorized as "inferior" (meaning lower), "superior" (meaning 

 If one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57°. Thus they have the same retinal image size which determines the size of the retinal image. The image recorded by a photographic film or image sensor is always a real image and is usually inverted. When measuring the height of an inverted image using the cartesian sign convention (where the x-axis is the optical axis) the value for hi will be negative, and as a result M will also be negative. However, the traditional sign convention used in photography is "real is positive, virtual is negative". Therefore, in photography: Object height and distance are always real and positive. When the focal length is positive the image's height, distance and magnification are real and positive. Only if the focal length is negative, the image's height, distance and magnification are virtual and negative. Therefore, the photographic magnification formulae are traditionally presented as

  An eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a type of lens that is attached to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. The objective lens or mirror collects light and brings it to focus creating an image. The eyepiece is placed near the focal point of the objective to magnify this image. The amount of magnification depends on the focal length of the eyepiece. The barrel is shaped to fit in a special opening of the instrument to which it 

1. the point of convergence of light rays or sound waves. The point at which the light rays meet after passing through a convex lens. A point at which rays of light or other radiation converge or from which they appear to diverge, as after refraction or reflection in an optical system. The distinctness or clarity of an image rendered by an optical system. The state of maximum distinctness or clarity of such an image. To cause light rays or other radiation to converge on or toward a central point; concentrate. To render an object or image in clear outline or sharp detail by adjustment of one's vision or an optical device. 2 the point at which light rays converge after passing through a lens. The point at which rays of light converge after passing through a convex lens to form a real image (real focus), or diverge from (virtual focus) after passing through a concave lens. To adjust an optical system (e.g. camera or projector) in order to obtain a sharp image. See confocal; principal focus; focal line. dark focus See resting state of accommodation. principal focus The axial image point produced by an optical system of an infinitely distant object (the second principal focus or posterior principal focus), or that axial object point for which the image will be formed at infinity (the first principal focus or anterior principal focus). A converging optical system or lens has two principal foci that are real. A diverging optical system or lens has a second principal focus that is virtual. In curved mirrors the two principal foci

 length f at the distance 2f from that image plane and then put an image sensor at 2f beyond that lens, that lens will relay the first image to the second image with 1:1 magnification (see thin lens formula showing that with object distance ). Ideally, this second image is the mirror image of the first image, so you could put an image sensor there and record the mirrored first image. If a longer distance is needed, this can be repeated. In modern optical telescopes and telescopic sights with a dual-focal plane design, the objective image is typically already inverted upon reaching the relay lenses, and thus needed to be inverted again back 

aberration - An imperfection in a lens or optical system which prevents a point focus. The dioptic power of a bifocal segment. Objects may appear to have a doubling or ghosting effect. May exist alone or in combination with nearsightedness. Optical a - An imaginary line joining the centers of curvature of a lens or symmetrical optical system. This defect of an optical system causes the image to be surrounded by a halo of colors. Its function is

 For optical instruments with an eyepiece, the linear dimension of the image seen in the eyepiece (virtual image in infinite distance) cannot be given, thus size means the angle subtended by the object at the focal point (angular size). Strictly speaking, one should take the tangent of that angle (in practice, this makes a difference only if the angle is larger than a few degrees). Thus, angular magnification is given by: is the angle subtended by the image at the rear focal point of the eyepiece. For example, the mean angular size of the Moon's disk as viewed from Earth's surface is about 0.52°. By convention, for magnifying glasses and optical microscopes, where the size of the object is a linear dimension and the apparent size is an angle, the magnification is the ratio between the apparent (angular) size as seen in the eyepiece and the angular size of the object when placed at the conventional closest distance of distinct vision: 25 cm from the eye. At this level of magnification, the image takes on a building block pattern or pixelated appearance, and the limits of resolution of the imaging system are evident.A periapical image filling the display of a computer monitor may be magnified by a factor of 10 times or more.Software displays of all digital images permit magnification of images.At the present time, the highest resolution intraoral solid-state detector for dentistry has a measured resolution of approximately 20 lp/mm; however, this does not mean that this level of resolution is obtained clinically. Resolution is also inversely proportional to the diameter of the laser beam. Slow scan motion influences resolution by the increment of plate advancement. This increment may be adjusted to increase or reduce resolution in some systems. A periapical image filling the display of a computer monitor may be magnified by a factor of 10 times or more. At this level of magnification, the image takes on a building block pattern or pixelated appearance, and the limits of resolution of the imaging system are evident.A desirable quality in intraoral image receptors is the ability to record a broad range of tissue attenuation differences—from gingiva to enamel.At the same time, subtle differences in attenuation within these tissues should be visually apparent.The useful range of densities in film radiography is two orders of magnitude, from 0.5 to 2.5. An autocollimator works by projecting an image onto a target mirror and measuring the deflection of the returned image against a scale, either visually or by means of an electronic detector. A visual autocollimator can measure angles as small as 1 arc-second (4.85 micro-radians), while an electronic autocollimator can have up to 100 times more resolution. An electronic autocollimator is typically calibrated to read the actual mirror angle.

In the New England town of New Gilead during the late 19th century, an unscrupulous drunkard named Waldo Trumbull (Vincent Price) runs the funeral parlor he acquired from his former business partner Amos Hinchley (Boris Karloff) after marrying his daughter Amaryllis (Joyce Jameson). Trumbull enlists the assistance of a fugitive picklock named Felix Gillie (Peter Lorre) in conducting his business cheaply by reusing the firm's only coffin to unceremoniously dump the deceased while arranging the occasional murder of wealthy clients.

Overall, Barton directed eight Abbott and Costello films, including their last movie as a team, Dance With Me, Henry, in 1956. Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man is a 1951 American science fiction comedy film directed by Charles Lamont and starring the team of Abbott and Costello alongside Nancy Guild. The film depicts the misadventures of Lou Francis and Bud Alexander, two private detectives investigating the murder of a boxing promoter. The film was part of a series in which the duo meet classic characters from Universal's stable, including Frankenstein, the Mummy and the Keystone Kops.

Rinaldo, who also wrote the scripts for several Universal films, including Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951); Hold That Ghost (1941); The Black Cat (1941) and The Invisible Woman (1940).

He originally gained fame when he released his eponymously titled debut solo effort on Atlantic Records in 1988. The album was produced by Monroe Jones and David Tickle, and executive produced by future Interscope founder Jimmy Iovine. After several years of struggle, Spence's composition "The Power" was covered by both Amy Grant and Cher and was also used for a national Century 21 advertising campaign. Subsequently, he recorded the indie release "painfaithjoy" in 1995. He performed with

Because his voice is distinctive, people were not fooled by the name Dale Cooke. The songwriter who could easily be considered America’s unofficial poet laureate has a new album in which he revisits past composition with new recordings and new interpretations. Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s. For his new album, entitled In the Blue Light, Simon has chosen 10 songs from his past that he felt needed to

 Brown decided not to re-sign with the label and during the 1970s, pursued a solo career as an independent arranger, producer and studio musician. During this period, he worked with artists such as Minnie Riperton (with whom he arranged and conducted an album on Epic Records), Curtis Mayfield, Johnny Nash, and Marvin Gaye (both live and in the studio). Brown also co-wrote Gaye's hit single "Sexual Healing" winning two Grammy awards. He went on to receive further awards recognizing his many talents, later in life. His collaborations with Ronson led to working in the United Kingdom including lead vocals on 2007 Ronson's hit "Stop Me", a cover version of "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before", a song by The Smiths.

After several years of struggle, Spence's composition "The Power" was covered by both Amy Grant and Cher and was also used for a national Century 21 advertising campaign. Subsequently, he recorded the indie release "painfaithjoy" in 1995. He performed with 

 The album was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles with producer David Anderle, who Kristofferson first worked with on Full Moon, his first collaboration with wife Rita Coolidge. Anderle cut the number of musicians so that there was a smaller palette of sounds, and Mike Utley once more made a major contribution to the overall sound and feel, predominantly laid-back and down-tempo, as did Jerry McGee with some tasteful guitar and dobro. As Streissguth writes: "Despite shrinking sales and blistering reviews, he doggedly pursued his vision, exploring street life in verse and indulging his love of sprawling ballads that featured a 

 Thanks a Lot is an album by American country singer Ernest Tubb, released in 1964 (see 1964 in music). notes from The Hits: "Pat Alger and I worked on this song quite a long time without a hook, without the line. We passed it by Larry Bastian and it was as if it was meant to be. Larry, his wife Myrna and I were taking a walk down 18th Avenue, and he looked at me and said, 'Oh, that's simple. This is probably the truest song I have ever been involved with as a writer. In 1956, for fear he would upset his fans, bandmates, and his record label, he released his first R&B single (called "Lovable") under the assumed name 'Dale Cooke'. Because his voice is distinctive, people were not fooled by the name Dale Cooke. The songwriter who could easily be considered America’s unofficial poet laureate has a new album in which he revisits past composition with new recordings and new interpretations. Paul Simon has been writing the soundtrack to multiple generations’ lives since the 1960s, when he and childhood friend Art Garfunkel took folk-rock music to new heights of popularity. Simon’s subsequent solo career allowed him to continue growing as a writer, musician and performer who produced some of the most critically acclaimed albums and songs from the 1970s and 1980s. For his new album, entitled In the Blue Light, Simon has chosen 10 songs from his past that he felt needed to

 Brown decided not to re-sign with the label and during the 1970s, pursued a solo career as an independent arranger, producer and studio musician. During this period, he worked with artists such as Minnie Riperton (with whom he arranged and conducted an album on Epic Records), Curtis Mayfield, Johnny Nash, and Marvin Gaye (both live and in the studio). Brown also co-wrote Gaye's hit single "Sexual Healing" winning two Grammy awards. He went on to receive further awards recognizing his many talents, later in life. His collaborations with Ronson led to working in the United Kingdom including lead vocals on 2007 Ronson's hit "Stop Me", a cover version of "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before", a song by The Smiths. In November 2019, Daniel announced his first single for ten years titled 'Everything I Need', followed up by an album announcement. Since 2017, Merriweather has been in a relationship with lawyer Coleen Mensa. "Silver (The Hunger)" from 1975’s Who’s to Bless and Who’s to Blame, seemed inspired by William Blake’s poetry or a Thomas Hardy novel, portraying in eight minutes a caddish buccaneer who confronts the awakening sensibilities of his naïve lover." Two songs, "Don’t Cuss the Fiddle" and "The Year 2003 Minus 25", would appear on Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson’s 1978 duet album, the 

 Humes began his recording career in the early 1980s, releasing the single "Dance So Fine" under the name Nijel in 1982. Working as a staff songwriter for Warner Brothers Music Publishing, he earned more public recognition when he wrote and produced nearly all of the tracks on Miki Howard's Atlantic Records debut album, Come Share My Love, including the top-ten R&B chart hit title track. Humes continued working with Howard, writing and producing several songs on her second album, Love Confessions, including (again) the title track.

Through Max Perutz, his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King's College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data.

Wilkins was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959 and an EMBO Member in 1964. Linus Pauling had published a proposed but incorrect structure of DNA, making the same basic error that Watson and Crick had made a year earlier. Wilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson–Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA. Wilkins, Crick, and Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material". Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center.

Watson and Crick are well-known for their significant contribution to the discovery of the helical structure of DNA. In 1953, they proposed a model in which DNA forms a double helix, consisting of two strands that are twisted around each other. By unraveling the structural foundation of DNA, Watson and Crick laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements in genetics, genomics, and biotechnology. Overall, the collaboration between Watson and Crick, coupled with insights from other scientists, led to the unveiling of the double helix structure of DNA, revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and paving the way for numerous scientific advancements. Francis Harry Compton Crick (8 June 1916 – 28 July 2004) was a British molecular biologist, biophysicist, and neuroscientist. He, James Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin played crucial roles in deciphering the helical structure of the DNA molecule. Crick and Watson's paper in Nature in 1953 laid the groundwork for understanding DNA structure and functions. Together with Maurice Wilkins, they were jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material". In 1945, the Nobel prize was awarded to Alexander Fleming, Ernst Boris Chain, and Sir Howard Walter Florey for the discovery of penicillin. The year 1962 saw another significant recognition with James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins winning the Nobel prize for their discovery of the structure and significance of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

[2024-06-14 14:56:36,077] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: An example of a price floor is minimum wage laws, where the government sets out the minimum hourly rate that can be paid for labour. When the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium market price for unskilled or low-skilled labour, employers hire fewer workers. At the same time, a minimum wage above the equilibrium wage would allow (or entice) more people to enter the labor market because of the higher salary. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. Advocates of raising the minimum wage assert this would provide households with more money to spend, while opponents recognize the impact this has on businesses', especially small businesses', ability to pay additional workers. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation or 

 StateMinimumWages-USA-20140101.png and U.S. territory (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), as of January 1, 2014. ]] Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. Together, these 3.3 million workers with wages at or below the minimum represent, respectively: 1.0% of the population, 1.6% of the labor force, 2.5% of all workers, and 4.3% of hourly workers. In economic terms, the living wage is similar to the minimum wage as it is a price floor for labor. It thus differs from the national minimum wage 

 ''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the Senate on November 19, 2013. National minimum wage law began with Winston Churchill's Trade Boards Act 1909, and the Wages Councils Act 1945 set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy. Wages Councils were abolished in 1993 and subsequently replaced with a single statutory national minimum wage by the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which is still in force. From 1 April 2016 the minimum wage has been paid as a mandatory National Living Wage for workers over 25. The major economic schools of thought - Classical economics, Keynesian economics, and the Austrian School - disagree about the importance and the effects of the minimum wage. According to a paper written in 2000 by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists agreed that a minimum wage increases unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with this statement. Some economic research has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases. Overall, there is no consensus between economists about the effects of minimum wages on youth employment, although empirical evidence suggests that this group is most vulnerable to high minimum wages. However, new evidence for workers that were bound by the minimum wage suggests a distinct negative impact on employment and income growth.

When the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium market price for unskilled or low-skilled labour, employers hire fewer workers. At the same time, a minimum wage above the equilibrium wage would allow (or entice) more people to enter the labor market because of the higher salary. The CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. Advocates of raising the minimum wage assert this would provide households with more money to spend, while opponents recognize the impact this has on businesses', especially small businesses', ability to pay additional workers. Critics argue raising employment costs deters hiring. During 2009, the minimum wage was $7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year, below poverty level for some families. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation or 

 StateMinimumWages-USA-20140101.png and U.S. territory (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), as of January 1, 2014. ]] Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. Together, these 3.3 million workers with wages at or below the minimum represent, respectively: 1.0% of the population, 1.6% of the labor force, 2.5% of all workers, and 4.3% of hourly workers. In economic terms, the living wage is similar to the minimum wage as it is a price floor for labor. It thus differs from the national minimum wage 

 ''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the Senate on November 19, 2013. National minimum wage law began with Winston Churchill's Trade Boards Act 1909, and the Wages Councils Act 1945 set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy. Wages Councils were abolished in 1993 and subsequently replaced with a single statutory national minimum wage by the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which is still in force. From 1 April 2016 the minimum wage has been paid as a mandatory National Living Wage for workers over 25. The major economic schools of thought - Classical economics, Keynesian economics, and the Austrian School - disagree about the importance and the effects of the minimum wage. According to a paper written in 2000 by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists agreed that a minimum wage increases unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with this statement. Some economic research has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases. Overall, there is no consensus between economists about the effects of minimum wages on youth employment, although empirical evidence suggests that this group is most vulnerable to high minimum wages. However, new evidence for workers that were bound by the minimum wage suggests a distinct negative impact on employment and income growth.

Contemporary Christian artist Wayne Watson recorded a song by the same name, with lyrics adapted to the music based on this poem. The song was written by John Kramp in 1974 while a freshman at Baylor University and recorded for Wayne Waston's first album Workin' In The Final Hour in 1980 and recorded 12 years later on his How Time Flies compilation project. A short film also titled The Touch of the Master's Hand won the Short Film Jury Award – U.S. Fiction at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival. Crossing the Water is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by Sylvia Plath that was prepared for publication by Ted Hughes. These are transitional poems that were written along with the poems that appear in her poetic opus, Ariel. The poems here, mostly written between 1960 and 1961, tend to dwell on one's state of being in an environment. "Wuthering Heights," for example, details a walk that Plath takes along the Yorkshire moors where Emily Brontë once trekked, Finisterre is a stormy island where Plath and her family once visited and "Among the Narcissi" describes Plath's similarities at being among asexual vegetation. As he suffered in pain, Lettie suffered, watching her husband slowly fade away. During this time, her best-selling devotional book, Streams in the Desert, was conceived. Lettie wrote a daily devotional based on her hardships and her experiences of fellowship with God. Each daily section contains a Bible passage and a quote from another author. The title of the book comes from Isaiah 35:6, "Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert." No one expected Streams to be as successful as it was. Cowman was not seeking success during the time she wrote it. When the book was being printed, her publisher was certain they would never publish more than the original printing of 3,000. Yet, many readers found they could connect with Streams because it "spoke to those who had difficulty relating their own sufferings to the noble and eternal purposes of a loving and all-wise God." Cowman often stated, "I did not write Streams. God gave me Streams." Carol Frost (born 1948) is an American poet. Frost has published several collections of poetry, and has held several teaching residencies. Frost is the founder and director of the Catskill Poetry Workshop at Hartwick College. Frost was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, and later graduated from the State University of Oneonta and Syracuse University after studying at the Sorbonne in Paris. Frost has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and is the winner of Pushcart Prizes. Frost's poetry has been praised for its "protean layers of observation" and her “encyclopedic approach to subject matter.” Frost writes in intensive bursts of at least three weeks after spending not writing for several weeks or months. After her bursts of writing she likes to walk or go sailing. Frost has also been a visiting poet at University of Wollongong in Australia. Wright's poetry is rooted in a sense of place and time and often employs distinct voices in dialogue, particularly those of the American South. Her work is formally inventive and often documentary in spirit, in the sense that it honors those whose stories or voices might be lost, were it not for her own writing. Her diction mixes high and low to surprising effect, and her range of reference is both broad and deep, including phrases from other languages, allusions to other poems, and pieces of conversation. Her books include precisely distilled lyrics such as those collected in Tremble as well as book-length poems beginning

Some Union Territories also elect an Assembly and have a territorial government and other (mainly smaller) Union Territories are governed by a person appointed by the President of India. The President of India dissolves the existing State government if necessary, and a new election is conducted. India has a parliamentary system as defined by its constitution, with power distributed between the central government and the states. The President of India is the ceremonial head of the country and supreme commander-in-chief for all defence forces in India. However, it is the Prime Minister of India, who is the leader of the party or political alliance having a majority in the national elections to the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister is the chief adviser to the President of India and the head of the Union Council of Ministers. India is regionally divided into States (and Union Territories) and each State has a Chief Minister who is the leader of the party or political alliance that has won a majority in the regional elections otherwise known 

  In the Republic of India, according to the Article 154 of Constitution of India, a governor is the constitutional head of each of the twenty-eight states. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Candidates are not elected directly by the citizens, but by the Members of Legislative Assemblies and up to 12  can be nominated by the President of India for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. Members of the Parliament in Rajya Sabha get a tenure of six years, with one-third of the body facing re-election every two years. The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its sessions. It is the duty of Chief Election Commissioner to conduct elections to the office of the President in a special session of Parliament and all the Provincial Assemblies in accordance with the provisions of Second Schedule to the Constitution. Both the houses of the state legislature jointly nominate Members of Parliament to the Rajya Sabha. Membership of Rajya Sabha is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of 250 members, and current laws have provision for 245 members. Most of the members of the House are indirectly elected by state and territorial legislatures using single transferable votes, while the President of India can appoint 12 members for their contributions to art, literature, science, and social services. The vice president of India is the second highest constitutional office in the government of India after the president. In accordance with Article 63 of the Constitution of India, the vice president discharges the functions of the president when a contingency arises due to the resignation, removal, death, impeachment or the inability of the president to discharge their functions. Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th and current president. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected. The president of India appoints a governor as the ceremonial representative of the union government. The governor appoints the chief minister on the nomination of the legislative assembly. The chief minister is the traditionally the leader of the party or coalition with most seats in the assembly. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha. The state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial president of India.

In accordance with Article 63 of the Constitution of India, the vice president discharges the functions of the president when a contingency arises due to the resignation, removal, death, impeachment or the inability of the president to discharge their functions. Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th and current president. The president is indirectly elected by an electoral college comprising both houses of the Parliament of India and the legislative assemblies of each of India's states and territories, who themselves are all directly elected. The president of India appoints a governor as the ceremonial representative of the union government. The governor appoints the chief minister on the nomination of the legislative assembly. The chief minister is the traditionally the leader of the party or coalition with most seats in the assembly. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha. The state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial president of India.

Swine Humans Birds Other animals Before being transmitted to humans, a H1N1 type virus is known to have circulated in swine. Analysis showed they were infected with the same strain—a H1N1 type containing genes of human, bird and swine origin. A 2004 study found that in Iowa, 20 percent of swine veterinarians and 3percent of meatpackers, but no university workers, had antibodies in their blood indicating they had been infected with swine flu. Another study, of 804 rural Iowans, found that pig farmers were 50 times more likely, and their spouses about 30 times more likely, than university workers to carry swine flu antibodies. Pigs

 Swine flu is one of many diseases that are contracted by person to person contact. A H1N1 flu is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by the influenza A virus. It causes high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs. Swine influenza viruses may circulate amongst pigs throughout the year. Studies show 30-50% of commercial US swine have been infected with swine flu. The mortality rate is 1-4%. However, they do sometimes cross the species barrier to cause disease in humans. The current human swine flu outbreak is caused by the H1N1 subtype. What are the symptoms in humans? Humans can get infected from direct contact or close proximity to infected pigs, so people working in the pig industry are most susceptible, Human-to-human transmissions can also occur. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze and then touching their mouth or nose before washing their hands.) Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Although the current swine flu does not have a high mortality rate, it is known to be highly contagious. Like all influenza viruses, swine flu viruses change constantly. When influenza viruses from different species infect a single subject, the viruses can reassort (i.e. The concern is if the new virus has a high morbidity and mortality rate (i.e. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze) and then touching their mouths or nose before washing their hands. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or

 fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association was the first to confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks. It's a novel combination of bird, pig and human viral genes never before found in the U.S. or elsewhere, so people have no immunity to it. It's a descendant of the H1N1 virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide in the pandemic of 1918-1919, mixed in with recent strains of swine and bird flu viruses. The 1918 virus originated in birds and then jumped to humans. This year's virus apparently jumped from a pig to a 5-year-old boy in Veracruz, Mexico, who passed it on to other humans. It's the initials of two sugar proteins (their scientific names are hemagglutinin and neuramidinase) that sit on the surface of the virus and do its dirty work. A new combination, H2N2, cause a brief swine flu epidemic in 1957. An H3N2 strain was the source of another epidemic in 1968. The bird flu virus that is began in Southeast Asia a decade ago and has spread throughout the Old World is an H5N1 combination. They're not vaccines to prevent an infection, but drugs to limit its impact. How does a new virus develop? Another possibility is gene-swapping. This can happen when a cell is infected by viruses from different creatures, say a chicken and a pig. In the new strain of H1N1 virus, pieces of human, bird and pig genes are all scrambled up. How does this H1N1 virus differ from the H1N1 that caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919? That virus developed various changes over the years, so

 also known to have been infected by humans. Humans have been affected since early 2009. The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, "opening a new chapter in the global epidemic". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission causes human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. Signs and symptoms In pigs, a swine influenza infection produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. Although mortality is usually low (around 1–4%), the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers. Pigs have often been seen as "mixing vessels", which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals, such as humans.

 located in the nose and throat but H1N1/09 can also infect cells with receptor type a2-3. In the southern hemisphere 15 to 33% of 

 Swine flu is one of many diseases that are contracted by person to person contact. A H1N1 flu is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease in pigs caused by the influenza A virus. It causes high levels of illness and low death rates in pigs. Swine influenza viruses may circulate amongst pigs throughout the year. Studies show 30-50% of commercial US swine have been infected with swine flu. The mortality rate is 1-4%. However, they do sometimes cross the species barrier to cause disease in humans. The current human swine flu outbreak is caused by the H1N1 subtype. What are the symptoms in humans? Humans can get infected from direct contact or close proximity to infected pigs, so people working in the pig industry are most susceptible, Human-to-human transmissions can also occur. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze and then touching their mouth or nose before washing their hands.) Swine influenza viruses are not transmitted by food. You can not get swine influenza from eating pork or pork products. Although the current swine flu does not have a high mortality rate, it is known to be highly contagious. Like all influenza viruses, swine flu viruses change constantly. When influenza viruses from different species infect a single subject, the viruses can reassort (i.e. The concern is if the new virus has a high morbidity and mortality rate (i.e. surfaces contaminated by droplets from a cough or sneeze) and then touching their mouths or nose before washing their hands. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or

 fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association was the first to confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks. It's a novel combination of bird, pig and human viral genes never before found in the U.S. or elsewhere, so people have no immunity to it. It's a descendant of the H1N1 virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide in the pandemic of 1918-1919, mixed in with recent strains of swine and bird flu viruses. The 1918 virus originated in birds and then jumped to humans. This year's virus apparently jumped from a pig to a 5-year-old boy in Veracruz, Mexico, who passed it on to other humans. It's the initials of two sugar proteins (their scientific names are hemagglutinin and neuramidinase) that sit on the surface of the virus and do its dirty work. A new combination, H2N2, cause a brief swine flu epidemic in 1957. An H3N2 strain was the source of another epidemic in 1968. The bird flu virus that is began in Southeast Asia a decade ago and has spread throughout the Old World is an H5N1 combination. They're not vaccines to prevent an infection, but drugs to limit its impact. How does a new virus develop? Another possibility is gene-swapping. This can happen when a cell is infected by viruses from different creatures, say a chicken and a pig. In the new strain of H1N1 virus, pieces of human, bird and pig genes are all scrambled up. How does this H1N1 virus differ from the H1N1 that caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-1919? That virus developed various changes over the years, so

 also known to have been infected by humans. Humans have been affected since early 2009. The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. The symptoms of this virus are identical to that of seasonal influenza. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, "opening a new chapter in the global epidemic". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. Swine influenza virus (SIV) or swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs. Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission causes human flu, it is called zoonotic swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. Signs and symptoms In pigs, a swine influenza infection produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. Although mortality is usually low (around 1–4%), the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers. Pigs have often been seen as "mixing vessels", which help to change and evolve strains of disease that are then passed on to other mammals, such as humans.

Here's to Auld Reekie, and its glorious Princes Street, Here's to Auld Reekie, and its famous Arthur Seat; Here's to Auld Reekie, and its grand Historic Scenes— The hame of Scotland's bravest lass, my bonnie Jeanie Deans. Oft I see her sad and dreary, Wi' tartan plaid and hame-spun gown; Broken-hearted, worn and weary, Tramping on to London town. Leaving those behind who missed her— Those who know what true love means— Seeking pardon for her sister, Brave, true hearted, Jeanie Deans. Chenoweth reflected on recording "I Will Always Love You" with ET Online, saying "it is a song I've loved since I was a child." She went on to say, "I used to think, 'One day I'm gonna sing that song.' Little did I know that I'd get to sing it with the queen herself."

The theft of the statues had been committed in 1907 by a former secretary of Apollinaire, Honoré Joseph Géry Pieret, who had recently returned one of the stolen statues to the French newspaper the Paris-Journal. Apollinaire implicated his friend Picasso, who had bought Iberian statues from Pieret, and who was also brought in for questioning in the theft of the Mona Lisa, but he was also exonerated. The theft of the Mona Lisa was perpetrated by Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian house painter who acted alone and was only caught two years later when he tried to sell the painting in Florence. ; The returned Mona Lisa only received 60 visits at the Louvre in Paris. The painting had been missing for about two-and-half years before Vincenzo Peruggia, a Louvre employee who had stolen the painting, attempted to sell it to museum officials in Florence. During the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck's Germany asked the France of Napoleon III to return works of art still held from the time of the looting but never repatriated. Vincenzo Peruggia described his 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa as an attempt to restore the painting to Italy, claiming incorrectly that the painting had been stolen by Napoleon. On 7 February 2013, the painting was vandalized by a visitor in Lens. A short time after the incident, the management of the Louvre and its Pas-de-Calais branch published a press release indicating that "at first glance, the inscription is superficial and should be easily removed".

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles. There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008. The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April. The crash was the fastest fall in global stock markets in financial history and the most devastating crash since the Wall Street Crash of 1929. It was more widespread than just the stock market as well. This saw banks and major financial institutions completely fail in many cases and took major government intervention to remedy during the period. By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1,369.7 points (14.3%), at the time its largest one-week point drop in history. The economic effects were mainly on the

On March 16, 2020, after it became clear that a recession was inevitable, the DJIA dropped 12.93%, or 2,997 points, the largest point drop since Black Monday (1987), surpassing the drop in the prior week, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.32%, and the S&P 500 Index dropped 11.98%. By the end of May 2020, the stock market indices briefly recovered to their levels at the end of February 2020. In June 2020 the Nasdaq surpassed its pre-crash high followed by the S&P 500 in August and the Dow in November. Meanwhile, many global financial markets plunge amid the decision and many stock markets take the selloff, with Nasdaq fell 1.32%, Dow Jones fell 0.37%, and S&P 500 down 0.73%. Dow Jones in particular, down as much as 961.63 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 50% during this stock market crash. The 2015 Chinese stock market crash was also a bear market. In early 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple stock market crashes have led to bear markets across the world, many of which are still ongoing. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the theory of rational human conduct, the theory of market equilibrium and the efficient-market hypothesis.

In the song, the main character, Tevye, explains the roles of each social class (fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters) in the village of Anatevka, and how the traditional roles of people like the matchmaker, the beggar, and the rabbi contribute to the village. The song also mentions the constable, the priest, and the other non-Jews with whom they rarely interact. Overall, the song sets up the major theme of the villagers trying to continue their traditions and keep their society running as the world around them changes. The song's lyrics begin with the speaker's memories of his father instilling pride in the family's hometown. While it first appears that the song will be a nostalgic look at the speaker's childhood, the song then goes on to describe the racial violence and economic depression that the speaker witnessed as an adolescent and a young adult. The song concludes with the speaker's reluctant proclamation that he plans to move his family out of the town, but not without first taking his own son on a drive and expressing the same community pride that was instilled in him by his father. Some of the song's images reference the recent history of Springsteen's hometown Freehold Borough, New Jersey, in particular the racial strife in 1960s New Jersey and economic tensions from the same times (such as the "textile mill being closed" was the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold). The song is a mid-tempo tune whose singer recalls being sent home one day from school for fighting when he was a child, and he tells his father what had happened, expecting punishment from his father. In the second verse, the singer has now become a father, and he had no doubt that his son was "just like (his) father's son", and he passes his father's secret on to his son. In the third and final verse, the singer dreams that he has died and is standing outside the gates of Heaven. It also serves as a toast to celebrate a wedding agreement between Tevye and Lazar. See and Heard wrote "In the inn scene Tevye leads a toast ‘To Life’ featuring an extravagant display of Jewish and Cossack folk dancing". In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical shtetl in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia, compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to "scratch out a pleasant, simple tune" without breaking their necks. Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for him tutoring his daughters. Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, a 

 "When I got back to my empty room, I suppose I must have cried." The chorus continues, to describe the furtive life of the illegal immigrant: "from rooms the daylight never sees, where lights don't glow on Christmas trees." The final chorus summarizes the conflicted psychology of the Irish emigrant ("where'er we go we celebrate, the land that makes us refugees") and takes a parting shot at the Irish Catholic church's "from fear of priests with empty plates/ from guilt, and weeping effigies."

During the journey he meets Bagheera, Baloo, King Louie, and the hypnotist snake Kaa as well as the evil Shere Khan. Tabaqui enters the stage and reveals that Shere Khan, the tiger, has killed four humans, among them the baby's parents. Raksha takes the baby to her mate Thuu and the pack-leader Akela and asks for permission to adopt the baby. None of the wolves are willing to, but Baloo, who has been sleeping in a dumpster, wakes up and speaks for him, as does Bagheera (who is portrayed as a transvestite) by offering the pack a buffalo he/she killed. Mowgli learns that it was Lockwood who shot off Hathi's tusk and discovers his hunting trophies, including the head of Bhoot. Mowgli returns the tusk to Hathi, offering him the hunter in exchange for ridding the jungle of Shere Khan. Mowgli meets with Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack, who refuse to go against jungle law to defeat Shere Khan. Unafraid, Mowgli lures Shere Khan to the edge of the village, where the tiger is surrounded by the elephant herd loyal to Hathi. Shere Khan and Mowgli battle, and Mowgli is able to wound Shere Khan severely. He saves Karkotaka, a cobra, from raging fire, but the cobra bites him, transforming Nala into Bahuka, the ugly 

 from Louie. When Mowgli learns of Akela's death by Shere Khan from Louie, he angrily decides to face Shere Khan, and steals a torch from the man-village, accidentally starting a fire in the jungle. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit and help to distract Shere Khan alongside Raksha and the rest of Mowgli's wolf pack so that Mowgli can set a trap that later kills Shere Khan. After Shere Khan is defeated and the fire extinguished, Mowgli is last seen sometime later with Baloo and Bagheera, having at last found his true home in the jungle. Shere Khan warns that when Akela misses his prey, the tiger will return to kill the boy. The child, known as Mowgli, is adopted by Nisha and raised with the wolves. Years pass, and Mowgli encounters Shere Khan, who has antagonized the nearby 'man-village' by breaking jungle law—killing the villagers’ cattle. Bagheera reveals to Mowgli that he is human, but Mowgli is determined to complete 'the Running', the test to earn full membership in 

 Mowgli's wolf-family and friends, ashamed for how they've treated him, rush to his aide. As the battle continues, Akela sacrifices himself to save Mowgli. With Messua and the village watching, Mowgli returns to the jungle, and the mortally-wounded Shere Khan makes one last attempt to kill Mowgli. Mowgli protects himself, and then slays the tiger. after Shere Khan telling the cubs a story about the cuckoo, he answers that he wants Mowgli dead as opposed to him simply leaving. When Mowgli returns to face Shere Khan with fire, she along with the rest of the pack are frightened of him as he has accidentally set the jungle ablaze. When he casts the fire away, Raksha rallies the wolves and is joined by Bagheera and Baloo in battling against Shere Khan so Mowgli has enough time to set a trap for the tiger and kill him. After the fire is put out by Mowgli and the elephants, Raksha and the other creatures of the jungle praise Mowgli.

In one scene, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II create a new song, "There's Music in You", then perform it for their friends, with Rodgers at the piano and Hammerstein singing the vocals. Mary Martin is later seen rehearsing the song for director Joshua Logan. The black-and-white film, which has a running time of 97 minutes, was directed by Tay Garnett, screenplay by Samson Raphaelson, based on a story Robert E. Sherwood, and photographed by James Wong Howe. Somewhere – The Songs of Sondheim and Bernstein is the third studio album by Australian singer Marina Prior featuring Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The songs "Tonight" and "One Hand, One Heart" are duets with American actor Sean McDermott, who played Tony in the production of West Side Story. In 1959 the British composer Peter Dickinson used part of the music in his Monologue for string orchestra, principally the melodic line under the lyric "People will say we're in...". He introduced the song "I Can Do That", although the specific story was actually that of another performer, Sammy Williams. During the development of the show, the creators also toyed with Cilento having a second solo titled "Joanne" about his first crush on a girl (done in a Gene Kelly-style dance), and appearing as a backup dancer for Cassie's nightclub act, which was later cut. Along with the rest of the cast, he is featured on the iconic marketing materials for the show, and he won the Theater World Award

 On the Town is a musical with music by Leonard Bernstein and book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, based on Jerome Robbins' idea for his 1944 ballet Fancy Free, which he had set to Bernstein's music. The musical introduced several popular and classic songs, among them "New York, New York", "Lonely Town", "I Can Cook, Too" (for which Bernstein also wrote the lyrics), and "Some Other Time". Each of the three sailors meets and quickly connects with a woman. The musical integrates dance into its storytelling: Robbins made several ballets and extended dance sequences for the show, including the "Imaginary Coney Island" ballet. Her television credits include The Tenth Month (1979), Miami Vice (1984), Reading Rainbow (1998), and Third Watch (2002). Her film credits include F/X (1986)

Sherwood, and photographed by James Wong Howe. Somewhere – The Songs of Sondheim and Bernstein is the third studio album by Australian singer Marina Prior featuring Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The songs "Tonight" and "One Hand, One Heart" are duets with American actor Sean McDermott, who played Tony in the production of West Side Story. In 1959 the British composer Peter Dickinson used part of the music in his Monologue for string orchestra, principally the melodic line under the lyric "People will say we're in...". He introduced the song "I Can Do That", although the specific story was actually that of another performer, Sammy Williams. During the development of the show, the creators also toyed with Cilento having a second solo titled "Joanne" about his first crush on a girl (done in a Gene Kelly-style dance), and appearing as a backup dancer for Cassie's nightclub act, which was later cut. Along with the rest of the cast, he is featured on the iconic marketing materials for the show, and he won the Theater World Award 

 Robbie Hart, a wedding singer, lives with his Grandma Rosie in Ridgefield, New Jersey. He and his band play a great wedding gig ("It’s Your Wedding Day"). At the wedding gig, Robbie meets a waitress named Julia Sullivan, who can't wait to get married ("Someday"). Afterward, Robbie tries to write a sweet (eventually corny) love song to Linda, with help from Julia, whom he had just met during the previous wedding ("Awesome"). The following day, however, Linda dumps Robbie at the altar, with only a note claiming 

 On the Town is a musical with music by Leonard Bernstein and book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, based on Jerome Robbins' idea for his 1944 ballet Fancy Free, which he had set to Bernstein's music. The musical introduced several popular and classic songs, among them "New York, New York", "Lonely Town", "I Can Cook, Too" (for which Bernstein also wrote the lyrics), and "Some Other Time". Each of the three sailors meets and quickly connects with a woman. The musical integrates dance into its storytelling: Robbins made several ballets and extended dance sequences for the show, including the "Imaginary Coney Island" ballet. Her television credits include The Tenth Month (1979), Miami Vice (1984), Reading Rainbow (1998), and Third Watch (2002). Her film credits include F/X (1986)

 "One Hand, One Heart" is a song from the musical West Side Story by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.

[2024-06-14 14:56:50,845] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: In the tenth canto, Krishna and Balarama travel to Yama's abode to bring back the dead son of their Guru, Sandipani Muni: "Lord Janārdana took the conchshell that had grown around the demon’s body and went back to the chariot. Then He proceeded to Saṁyamanī, the beloved capital of Yamarāja, the lord of death. Upon arriving there with Lord Balarāma, He loudly blew His conchshell, and Yamarāja, who keeps the conditioned souls in check, came as soon as he heard the resounding vibration. Yamarāja elaborately worshiped the two Lords with great devotion, and then he addressed Lord Kṛṣṇa, who lives in everyone’s heart: “O Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, what shall I do for You and Lord Balarāma, who are playing the part of ordinary humans?” The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Suffering the bondage of his past activity, My spiritual master’s son was brought here to you. According to some other accounts, Varuna asked Parashurama to hurl his axe into the sea. So he went to Mount Kailasa to his guru, Lord Shiva and requested him to take abode in Kerala and thereby bless the region. Shri Shiva accompanied by his wife Parvati, his sons Ganesha and Subrahmanya and his parashadas went along with Parashurama, to oblige his disciple. Later he and his party disappeared and Parashurama saw a bright and radiant Shiva lingam 

 From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (shakti) implies a divine source of energy, God or shaktiman. As Krishna is believed to be the source of all manifestations of God, "Radha, his consort, is the original source of all shaktis" or feminine manifestation of divine energy. The first theologo-philosophical justification for worshiping Radha-Krishna was given by Nimbarkacharya, a founder of the Nimbarka Sampradaya in 12th or 13th century. Another name of Ananta Shesha (who has an avesha of Lord Vishnu) ; One who has both the powers of attraction and repulsion, upon whom rests Lord Vishnu within the universe at Ksheera Sagara ; One who is the Lord of Ahamkara (Individual Ego) ; Second amongst the fourfold manifestation (Chatur-Vyuha) of Lord Vishnu (i.e. Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha) ; in achamana .. he is indicated by touching the part of face under the nose. During the Kali Yuga these sampradāyas appear in the holy place of Jaganatha Puri, and purify the entire earth. Each of them were inaugurated by a deity, who appointed heads to these lineages: Other major Vaishnav sampradaya are: 

 Balasubramaniam or Balasubramanian (பாலசுப்ரமணியம்; బాల సుబ్రహ్మణ్యం; ಬಾಲಸುಬ್ರಹ್ಮಣ್ಯಂ; ബാലസുബ്രഹ്മണ്യം) is a male given name in South India and Sri Lanka. Balasubramaniam is derived from the Sanskrit words balu meaning "young" and Subramaniam (itself derived from the Sanskrit words su, meaning "auspicious" and brahmanyam, translated loosely as "auspicious effulgence of the Supreme Spirit"). By extension, it refers to the Hindu god Murugan as a child or young man, the way the term Balakrishna refers to the young Krishna. He is the founder of Mahanubhava Sampradaya of Krishnaite Vaishnavism in 1267. While Balarama suggests attacking declaring war on Shishupala immediately, Uddhava points out that this would involve many kings and disrupt Yudhishthira's ceremony (where their presence is required). Pleased with this plan, Krishna sets out (Canto III) with his army to Indraprastha where the ceremony will be held. On the way, he sees Mount Raivataka (Canto IV), decides to camp 

 Narada (नारद, ), or Narad Muni, is a god-sage, famous in Hindu traditions as a travelling musician and storyteller, who carries news and enlightening wisdom. He appears in a number of Hindu texts, notably the Mahabharata, telling Yudhishtira the story of Prahlada and the Ramayana as well as in the Puranas. He is also referred to as Rishiraj, meaning the king of all sages or rishis.

Another name of Ananta Shesha (who has an avesha of Lord Vishnu) ; One who has both the powers of attraction and repulsion, upon whom rests Lord Vishnu within the universe at Ksheera Sagara ; One who is the Lord of Ahamkara (Individual Ego) ; Second amongst the fourfold manifestation (Chatur-Vyuha) of Lord Vishnu (i.e. Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha) ; in achamana .. he is indicated by touching the part of face under the nose. During the Kali Yuga these sampradāyas appear in the holy place of Jaganatha Puri, and purify the entire earth. Each of them were inaugurated by a deity, who appointed heads to these lineages: Other major Vaishnav sampradaya are: 

 Balasubramaniam or Balasubramanian (பாலசுப்ரமணியம்; బాల సుబ్రహ్మణ్యం; ಬಾಲಸುಬ್ರಹ್ಮಣ್ಯಂ; ബാലസുബ്രഹ്മണ്യം) is a male given name in South India and Sri Lanka. Balasubramaniam is derived from the Sanskrit words balu meaning "young" and Subramaniam (itself derived from the Sanskrit words su, meaning "auspicious" and brahmanyam, translated loosely as "auspicious effulgence of the Supreme Spirit"). By extension, it refers to the Hindu god Murugan as a child or young man, the way the term Balakrishna refers to the young Krishna. He is the founder of Mahanubhava Sampradaya of Krishnaite Vaishnavism in 1267. While Balarama suggests attacking declaring war on Shishupala immediately, Uddhava points out that this would involve many kings and disrupt Yudhishthira's ceremony (where their presence is required). Pleased with this plan, Krishna sets out (Canto III) with his army to Indraprastha where the ceremony will be held. On the way, he sees Mount Raivataka (Canto IV), decides to camp 

 Narada (नारद, ), or Narad Muni, is a god-sage, famous in Hindu traditions as a travelling musician and storyteller, who carries news and enlightening wisdom. He appears in a number of Hindu texts, notably the Mahabharata, telling Yudhishtira the story of Prahlada and the Ramayana as well as in the Puranas. He is also referred to as Rishiraj, meaning the king of all sages or rishis.

[2024-06-14 14:56:52,466] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: A diastema (plural diastemata, from greek διάστημα, space) is a space or gap between two teeth. Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth. In humans, the term is most commonly applied to an open space between the upper incisors (front teeth). It happens when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. This is more prone to recession or by tongue thrusting, which can push the teeth apart. Gaps can occur between any teeth, but for those with large gaps between the front facing teeth, dental gaps can be a source of self-consciousness. What Causes Gaps between Teeth? Size mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth. In some cases, the labial frenum extends down and between the two front teeth, creating a gap. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. Porcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments. Dental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps. Dental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth. Traditional Orthodontics: Traditional orthodontics is highly effective at closing gaps between teeth. Older children and adults will generally require additional treatment, like braces, to close gaps after a frenectomy. Any abnormality in teeth directly hampers the first look and diastema is one of the most common abnormalities seen in teeth. Diastema is usually a midline space between front two teeth, also seen in posterior teeth. In simple words, Diastema is the gap between teeth. Anterior spaces may interfere with smile, attractiveness and compromise facial esthetics. Diastema is among the most frequent reasons why patients seek orthodontic treatment. Diastema is a prominent gap between two teeth. It is most commonly seen between central incisors (your front teeth) and sometimes between molars (posterior teeth). Diastema is common in milk teeth or primary dentition because of altering teeth and jaw sizes as we grow up. The gap between teeth can be corrected with the orthodontic intervention which falls under the branch of corrective orthodontics. It is a simple procedure and involves the use of brackets, stainless steel wires and elastics depending upon the extent of the diastema and overall condition of the jaws. Periodontally speaking, if there is an overgrowth in the surrounding tissue of the affected teeth, that is, the overgrowth of gums or attached gingiva, unwanted space is created between the teeth leading to diastema formation. The frenum is an extension of our gum in between specific teeth like central incisors, anteriorly and the molars, posteriorly. Gum diseases like Gingivitis and Periodontitis that is, inflammation of gums and surrounding tooth structure, respectively, can also lead to the gap between teeth or diastema. One common cause is size mismatch, where the size of the teeth is smaller compared to the size of the jaw bone. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. To address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps. Crowding refers to the lack of sufficient space in the dental arch to accommodate all the teeth properly. It can involve a single tooth or a group of teeth and may occur on one side or both sides of the mouth. Occasionally, some primary teeth are slow to exfoliate (fall out), and the dentist may want to remove a primary tooth early to prevent orthodontic problems. Likewise, premature loss of primary teeth may create orthodontic problems later on. When a tooth is lost prematurely, removable or fixed spacers may be needed to prevent the shifting of teeth. Consistent with a high palate is a narrow arch shape of the 

The physiologic adaptation that can lead to malocclusion in a patient with a history of digit sucking and gaps between their front teeth is known as tongue thrust. This can exert pressure on the front teeth, causing them to move forward and create gaps. Normally, the tongue rests against the roof of the mouth, which helps promote proper jaw and teeth alignment. These changes further contribute to malocclusion and may require orthodontic intervention to correct. It is crucial to address both the digit sucking habit and tongue posture to prevent and correct any dental and skeletal misalignments that may arise. It is one of the most common dental anomalies and has a negative impact on both looks and function. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors. The phenomenon can be subdivided into the following according to the number of teeth concerned: 1. Anodontia: complete absence of teeth

Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps. Crowding refers to the lack of sufficient space in the dental arch to accommodate all the teeth properly. It can involve a single tooth or a group of teeth and may occur on one side or both sides of the mouth. Occasionally, some primary teeth are slow to exfoliate (fall out), and the dentist may want to remove a primary tooth early to prevent orthodontic problems. Likewise, premature loss of primary teeth may create orthodontic problems later on. When a tooth is lost prematurely, removable or fixed spacers may be needed to prevent the shifting of teeth. Consistent with a high palate is a narrow arch shape of the 

The physiologic adaptation that can lead to malocclusion in a patient with a history of digit sucking and gaps between their front teeth is known as tongue thrust. This can exert pressure on the front teeth, causing them to move forward and create gaps. Normally, the tongue rests against the roof of the mouth, which helps promote proper jaw and teeth alignment. These changes further contribute to malocclusion and may require orthodontic intervention to correct. It is crucial to address both the digit sucking habit and tongue posture to prevent and correct any dental and skeletal misalignments that may arise. It is one of the most common dental anomalies and has a negative impact on both looks and function. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors. The phenomenon can be subdivided into the following according to the number of teeth concerned: 1. Anodontia: complete absence of teeth

In 1995, the CN Tower was classified as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers, and for more than 30 years it was the world's tallest free-standing structure. The CN Tower consists of many inner attractions like the Glass Floor, SkyPod, 360 restaurant and EdgeWalk. EdgeWalk is a full circle hands-free walk on a 5 feet wide ledge encircling the top of the Tower, which is 1,168 feet aboveground. It has also been mentioned in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest external walk on a building. Also, the CN Tower provides various services for individuals with disabilities and special needs. The CN Tower (Tour CN) is a 553.3 m concrete communications and observation tower located in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Its name "CN" originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. The CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years until 2007 when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts more than two million international visitors annually. For comparison, the Eiffel Tower sits on a square 129 meters to a side, giving surface-area-to-height ratio of 1:2.3. The fifteen-floor Beaux Arts building was built by Sproatt & Rolph and stands at 285 ft, 321 ft including its weather beacon. It was the fourth building to serve as the headquarters of Canada Life, Canada's oldest, and at the time largest insurance company. The CN Tower was surpassed in 2009 by the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China, which stands at 604 m tall, as the world's tallest tower; which in turn was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree in 2011, which currently is the tallest tower at 634.0 m in height. The CN Tower, as of 2018, stands as the ninth-tallest free-standing structure on land, remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, and is the third-tallest tower. Two 5.33 m allegories of peace and freedom stand at 

 When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at 447 m, the Indoor Observation Level (later named Indoor Lookout Level) at 346 m, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at 342 m. One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes. The tower would garner world wide media attention when stuntman Dar Robinson jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980. Completed in 1990 and designed by César Pelli, the building measures 757 ft tall with 60 stories. The building was designed with 485000 ft2 

 In the 1970s, Toronto experienced major economic growth and surpassed Montreal to become the largest city in Canada. The area's First Canadian Place is the tallest building in Canada at height of 298 metres (978 feet). The CN Tower, once the tallest free-standing structure in the world, remains the tallest such structure in the Americas, standing at 553.33 metres (1,815 ft., 5 inches). The CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere. As of 2013, there are only two other freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere which exceed 500 m in height; the Willis Tower in Chicago, which stands at 527 m when measured to its pinnacle; and the topped-out One World Trade Center in New York City, which has a pinnacle height of 541.33 m, or approximately 12 m shorter than the CN Tower. The proposed Chicago Spire was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its construction was halted early due to financial difficulties amid the Great Recession, and was eventually cancelled in 2010.

The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, its first Test win on English soil. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a "milk-white" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called "play" and the "leathern orb" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, 

 The first Test match between England and Australia was played in Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907, the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Sporting Times printed a mocking obituary notice for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia. The first Test double century was scored at The Oval in 1884 by Australia's Billy Murdoch. In the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term "the Ashes" largely disappeared from public use. The term became popular again in Australia first, when George Giffen, in his memoirs (With Bat and Ball, 1899), used the term as if it were well known. The true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when 

 umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches. The first written "Laws of Cricket" were drawn up in 1744. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart". As they held the Ashes, Australia's captains Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. It was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.

He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a "milk-white" bail perched on two stumps; toss a coin for first knock, the umpire called "play" and the "leathern orb" was bowled. They had four-ball overs, 

 The first Test match between England and Australia was played in Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907, the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Sporting Times printed a mocking obituary notice for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia. The first Test double century was scored at The Oval in 1884 by Australia's Billy Murdoch. In the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term "the Ashes" largely disappeared from public use. The term became popular again in Australia first, when George Giffen, in his memoirs (With Bat and Ball, 1899), used the term as if it were well known. The true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when 

 umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches. The first written "Laws of Cricket" were drawn up in 1744. The ball must be between 5 & 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart". As they held the Ashes, Australia's captains Bob Simpson and Bill Lawry were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. It was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.

The kids consumed great amounts of popcorn, and [Walt] Disney enjoyed himself as much as anybody. While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example. Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. Plans for a second Disney park in Tokyo were first conceived in 1987. Initially, these plans included a park similar to Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios), to be called Disney Hollywood Studio Theme Park at Tokyo Disneyland. During the creation of the park, the United States and Japan had to compromise on certain design elements of the park due to cultural differences, such as the park's entrance focal point. Ground was broken on October 22, 1998 and the park opened on September 4, 2001. Upon opening, Tokyo DisneySea became the ninth park of the twelve worldwide Disney theme parks to 

 When Walt Disney World opened in 1971, it featured many popular Disneyland rides, but not Pirates of the Caribbean. The Western River Expedition was to have been Walt Disney World's answer to this ride. When plans were being made for the Magic Kingdom, Imagineers had no plans to replicate Pirates of the Caribbean for the Magic Kingdom. Disney management thought that cowboys and Indians would be more surprising and exciting to Florida residents. One of the largest resorts in the world, Walt Disney World Resort, was opened near Orlando, Florida in 1971. Disneyland Park, originally Euro Disneyland Park, is a theme park found at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France. The park opened on 12 April 1992 as the first of the two parks built at the resort. Designed and built by Walt Disney Imagineering, its layout is similar to Disneyland Park in California and Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Florida. Spanning 56.656 ha—the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland Park—it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The park is represented by Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle), a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. Here is a list of the current attractions found therein, arranged by "land" and with brief descriptions. These are only attractions from the Disney California Adventure itself, not from Disneyland park or other parts of the Disneyland Resort, and that parades and character meets are not listed in this article. (The term "attractions" is used by Disney as a catch-all term for rides, shows, and exhibits.)

The resort is fully owned and operated by The Oriental Land Company under a license from The Walt Disney Company, who constructed and designed the resort and its various attractions. The resort opened on April 15, 1983, as a single theme park (Tokyo Disneyland), but later developed into a resort with a second theme park (Tokyo DisneySea), four Disney hotels, six non-Disney hotels and a shopping complex (Ikspiari). Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney theme park to open outside the United States and the resort is the only Disney Parks resort in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.

The kids consumed great amounts of popcorn, and [Walt] Disney enjoyed himself as much as anybody. While very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, The Walt Disney Company is the best known and most extreme example. Its enormous success spawned several other Disney theme parks and resorts. Plans for a second Disney park in Tokyo were first conceived in 1987. Initially, these plans included a park similar to Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios), to be called Disney Hollywood Studio Theme Park at Tokyo Disneyland. During the creation of the park, the United States and Japan had to compromise on certain design elements of the park due to cultural differences, such as the park's entrance focal point. Ground was broken on October 22, 1998 and the park opened on September 4, 2001. Upon opening, Tokyo DisneySea became the ninth park of the twelve worldwide Disney theme parks to 

 When Walt Disney World opened in 1971, it featured many popular Disneyland rides, but not Pirates of the Caribbean. The Western River Expedition was to have been Walt Disney World's answer to this ride. When plans were being made for the Magic Kingdom, Imagineers had no plans to replicate Pirates of the Caribbean for the Magic Kingdom. Disney management thought that cowboys and Indians would be more surprising and exciting to Florida residents. One of the largest resorts in the world, Walt Disney World Resort, was opened near Orlando, Florida in 1971. Disneyland Park, originally Euro Disneyland Park, is a theme park found at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France. The park opened on 12 April 1992 as the first of the two parks built at the resort. Designed and built by Walt Disney Imagineering, its layout is similar to Disneyland Park in California and Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Florida. Spanning 56.656 ha—the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland Park—it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. The park is represented by Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle), a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. Here is a list of the current attractions found therein, arranged by "land" and with brief descriptions. These are only attractions from the Disney California Adventure itself, not from Disneyland park or other parts of the Disneyland Resort, and that parades and character meets are not listed in this article. (The term "attractions" is used by Disney as a catch-all term for rides, shows, and exhibits.)

 time since 2009. Three Vikings scored eight touchdowns: running back Latavius Murray, wide receiver Stefon Diggs, and tight end Kyle Rudolph. This would be the Vikings' final win in a playoff game until (after) 2017. The previous playoff meeting between the two teams was the 2009 NFC Championship game, which was notable for the excessive roughness of the Saints, later termed "Bountygate," as well as the Vikings driving close to a game-winning field goal before quarterback Brett Favre threw an interception. Prior to the 2016 season, Minnesota's starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater suffered a non-contact injury that produced a dislocated knee, torn ACL and "other structural damage." The severity of the injury nearly cost Bridgewater his leg and compelled the Vikings to trade two draft picks to the Philadelphia Eagles for Sam Bradford as a replacement. This year's NFC Championship Game is also dubbed by many as the "Bountygate Game" that also resulted in several players and coaching staff (including head coach Sean Payton) receiving 12-month suspensions three years later. The Vikings had 10 Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season. In a 2018 retrospective, Sports Illustrated called the 1998 Vikings "The Greatest Team Never to Make It." The loss had a dramatic effect on Minnesota sports culture, as the 1998 Vikings were considered the team most likely to deliver a Super Bowl championship to a franchise that had already suffered multiple heartbreaking defeats.

The team's record at the dome was 162–88 in the regular season and 6–4 in playoff games. The Vikings won the game 29–24 on a last second 61-yard catch by wide receiver Stefon Diggs, in a play that became known as the Minneapolis Miracle. The Vikings then advanced to the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, where the Vikings lost 38–7, costing the Vikings the chance to become the first NFL team to play a Super Bowl in its own home stadium.
