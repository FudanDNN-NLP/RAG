In October, Holland said that No Way Home was treated as \"the end of a franchise\" that began with Spider-Man: Homecoming, and that any additional solo films featuring the MCU Spider-Man characters would be different from this trilogy of films, building \"something different\" with a tonal change, in part due to Parker being stripped of his real-world identity at the end of No Way Home.

Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return at that time. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were writing the screenplay for the third film by the time of Sony's announcement, after also doing so for Far From Home, but Watts was receiving offers to direct large films for other studios instead of returning to the franchise, including potentially working on a different property for Marvel Studios and Feige. However, The Hollywood Reporter noted that there were no official plans for a new trilogy, despite the strong working relationship between the studios.

Morton was born in New York City to British parents, and made his stage debut in a New York production of The Prodigal Daughter. He was married to the novelist and actress Concordia Merrel, who posed for many of his photographs, and with her was the father of the twin painters Cavendish Morton and Concord Morton. After a period of nomadic wandering the family settled in Bembridge in the Isle of Wight where the couple home-schooled their sons with an emphasis on the arts. Morton was born in Ridley Township, in Chester County, present-day Delaware County, in 1725, the exact month is unknown. His father, John Morton (Senior), was Finnish, who originated from Finland, then a part of the Realm of Sweden, with his great-grandfather, Martti Marttinen,  or Måns Mårtensson (name alternated for Swedish military records, later anglicized as Morton), himself a native of Juva, Finland, who had arrived in the Swedish colony of New Sweden in 1654. His mother, Mary Archer, was also of Finnish descent. When Morton was about seven years old, his mother married John Sketchley, a farmer of English ancestry, who educated Morton. About 1748, Morton married Ann Justis, the great-granddaughter of Finnish colonists to New Sweden. Morton was an active member of the Anglican Church in Chester County. He started editing video at Metropolis Video in London's Neal's Yard in 1998 working on music videos, documentaries, television, commercial and non-commercial, with directors such as Jonas Akerlund, Chris Cunningham, Johan Renck and editing music videos for artists such as Madonna, Jamiroquai, Manic Street Preachers, Justin Timberlake and Moby.\n\n"

These songs were originally performed by Hollywood Rose and were only later played by Guns N' Roses. In fact, when Rose, Weber and Stradlin composed these songs, they were not yet in touch with Slash, McKagan or Adler. Before the album's release in June 2004, Rose sued the record label Cleopatra Records for \"trademark infringement, violation of rights in his name and likeness, and for unfair competition\", and filed a motion to block the release, however a judge denied the motion and the album was released.

The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside. Based on the 1966 short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\" by Philip K. Dick, Total Recall tells the story of Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker who receives a memory implant about a fantastical adventure on Mars. He subsequently finds his adventure occurring in reality as agents of a shadow organization try to prevent him from recovering memories of his past as a Martian secret agent aiming to stop the tyrannical regime of Martian dictator Vilos Cohaagen \n\n In a dystopian version of 1996, an alliance of corrupt government and corporate military forces have taken control of the world in the guise of the \"New Order Nation\" (NON). A different recording of the song was released as a B-side on the \"Live and Let Die\" single in 1991, which is identical to the Sound City Session version later included on the Appetite for Destruction Deluxe Edition. Alaimo has appeared in some feature films including the 1984 science fiction movie The Last Starfighter (portraying the human guise of an alien assassin), the Leslie Nielsen film Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult, Tango & Cash, and the 1988 film The Dead Pool. He also appeared as Curtis Block in the television movie Case Closed and as a security officer on Mars in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Total Recall.

Watch You Bleed documents the history of Guns N' Roses from the earliest childhood days of singer W. Axl Rose and his lifelong friendship with guitarist Izzy Stradlin to the formation of the band, their years at the top of the music world and eventual downfall. There is some charting of the former members' later careers with bands like Velvet Revolver and also of Rose's efforts to record and release the Chinese Democracy album, finally released on November 23, 2008. Willis starred with Tracy Morgan in the comedy Cop Out, directed by Kevin Smith and about two police detectives investigating the theft of a baseball card. Willis appeared in the music video for the song \"Stylo\" by Gorillaz. Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with former Planet Hollywood co-owners and '80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film The Expendables. Willis played the role of generic bald man \"Mr. Church\". After standing in the arena, he walks away as the audience files in to Metallica's traditional opener, \"Ecstasy of Gold\".\n\n"

Stemming from a bizarre kind of electronic Brian Jonestown Massacre demo that Ellie had created with de-tuned acoustic guitars and multiple character vocals we set about creating a live 'Wolf Alice' version in our rehearsal space. It wasn't until some time later when we were in a preproduction studio in LA and we were banging our heads together trying to work out what happens in that particular section when Ellie said to give her playback of the track and a microphone and she would ad-lib something. In classic Ellie form she found a part that was both musically, lyrically and contextually perfect for the section within her first two takes and had all us lads jumping around the control room setting off our airhorn apps.'\" Shiflett's \"sharp and clean sense of melodic playing\", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that \"with three guitars, you have to be careful that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated.\" Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound – as Grohl declared, \"if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge.\" Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at the suggestion of Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one \n\n Mann and Leo frequently trade off lead vocal duties within their songs, each taking a verse before joining in harmonies that \"expertly interw[ea]ve their voices.\" The Both have also become known for their extended on-stage \"jokey banter\", with \"quips and asides\" described as \"nearly as great as the songs they fed into.\" Their concerts have been called \"one part super-group show, and one part close friends... fluidly (and hilariously) play[ing] off of one another.\" The Both typically perform with a guest drummer who is introduced and acknowledged, but who has no singing or speaking role onstage. But I really haven't played much guitar in the last \n\n The Oblivians' sound was much harsher than the Compulsive Gambler's sound had been, owing both to Friedl's influence on the band, and to some of the music the members had taken to heart since the Gamblers disbanded, including Thee Headcoats and The Gories. The music was also much more stripped-down than that of the Compulsive Gamblers; the Oblivians had no bass player and no bass drum on their drum kit, instead using only two guitars and a standard drum kit between the three of them. Despite being offered a chance to record for free, with the only condition being that they add a bass player to the lineup, the band opted to record elsewhere rather than conform to the request.

Stemming from a bizarre kind of electronic Brian Jonestown Massacre demo that Ellie had created with de-tuned acoustic guitars and multiple character vocals we set about creating a live 'Wolf Alice' version in our rehearsal space. It wasn't until some time later when we were in a preproduction studio in LA and we were banging our heads together trying to work out what happens in that particular section when Ellie said to give her playback of the track and a microphone and she would ad-lib something. In classic Ellie form she found a part that was both musically, lyrically and contextually perfect for the section within her first two takes and had all us lads jumping around the control room setting off our airhorn apps.'\" Shiflett's \"sharp and clean sense of melodic playing\", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that \"with three guitars, you have to be careful that it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated.\" Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound – as Grohl declared, \"if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge.\" Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills at the suggestion of Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one \n\n Mann and Leo frequently trade off lead vocal duties within their songs, each taking a verse before joining in harmonies that \"expertly interw[ea]ve their voices.\" The Both have also become known for their extended on-stage \"jokey banter\", with \"quips and asides\" described as \"nearly as great as the songs they fed into.\" Their concerts have been called \"one part super-group show, and one part close friends... fluidly (and hilariously) play[ing] off of one another.\" The Both typically perform with a guest drummer who is introduced and acknowledged, but who has no singing or speaking role onstage. But I really haven't played much guitar in the last \n\n The Oblivians' sound was much harsher than the Compulsive Gambler's sound had been, owing both to Friedl's influence on the band, and to some of the music the members had taken to heart since the Gamblers disbanded, including Thee Headcoats and The Gories. The music was also much more stripped-down than that of the Compulsive Gamblers; the Oblivians had no bass player and no bass drum on their drum kit, instead using only two guitars and a standard drum kit between the three of them. Despite being offered a chance to record for free, with the only condition being that they add a bass player to the lineup, the band opted to record elsewhere rather than conform to the request.

Harpagophytum ( ), also called grapple plant, wood spider, and most commonly devil's claw, is a genus of plants in the sesame family, native to southern Africa. Plants of the genus owe their common name \"devil's claw\" to the peculiar appearance of their hooked fruit. Several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea and certain species of Pisonia, however, are also known by this name. Etymology The genera name is derived from the Greek words harpago meaning hook and phyton meaning plant.

Ecology and management Harpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact.

The title track, which was the third release, became Wills's first Number One hit on the country charts in mid-1999. \"I Can't Make You Love Me\", a Bonnie Raitt original, was the last commercial single which quickly became a radio favorite, topping radio charts in the country. formed the Universal Music Group forced its debut album, Antidote, to remain in its vaults, although the single “One More to Go” (featuring Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, Street Life, and GZA) b/w “Bomb Threat,” was released and the album was later leaked. The group was also featured on NBA All-Star and rapper Shaquille O'Neal's 1998 album Respect. However, as with Antidote, copies of the record were leaked, and a promo CD was pressed. After the departure of Finesse due to undisclosed business reasons, the group finally managed to release an album with 2002's Still Standing, on Rocks the World/Caroline/Virgin/EMI Records. Five of the ten songs of the album are from two successful movies by the singer: Grease (1978) and Xanadu (1980). The album omitted some singles released by Newton-John during this period (1978-1982) including songs from Grease (\"Summer Nights\"), Totally Hot (\"Deeper Than the Night\", \"Totally Hot\", \"Dancin' 'Round and 'Round\") and Physical (\"Landslide\"). The album cover and poster insert, designed by artist Victor Stabin, featured a winking Criss. A lip-synched German television performance of \"Talk to Me\" and \"She's So European\" featured the debut of Eric Carr, who became the band's permanent drummer until he died in 1991. Kiss then toured Europe and Australia (where their popularity was at an all-time high) and played \"Is That You? \", \"Talk to Me\", \n\n During the recording sessions for Poison the Well's fourth studio album, Versions, the band recorded more than enough songs than were necessary for one full album. After the release of Versions, Poison the Well had considered releasing the extra songs in a special way, however nothing had materialized until late 2008 when the band came up with the idea of a limited edition pressing on vinyl. In the UK and Ireland, the band's cover of \"Poison\" became a top 40 hit, peaking at #32 in the Official UK Singles Chart which helped the band reach to new territories such as Spain and China, where \"God Is a Girl\" became the most successful song of 2007, having been downloaded more than 1.5 million times. In July 2006, the band released their third studio album 21st Century, which included their recent singles \"Holy Virgin\", \"On the Radio\" and \"21st Century Digital Girl\". With only moderate success with their third album, Groove Coverage did not release any more music until late 2007, where they released the single \"Because I Love You\" to promote their first Greatest Hits compilation.\n\n"

By mid February 1896, the Italian expeditionary force concentrated on the Sauria hills, near Adwa, a small settlement where the Ethiopian army was encamped. The conflict ended with a treaty of friendship, which delimited the border between Ethiopia and Italian Eritrea but contained clauses whose different interpretations led to another Italo-Ethiopian war.

At the end of 2013, Eroski posted a turnover of €6.6 billion, operating 2.069 stores made up of 90 Eroski hypermarkets, 1,211 Eroski/center, Caprabo, Eroski/city, Aliprox, Familia, Onda and Cash & Carry supermarkets, 155 branches of Eroski travel agencies, 63 petrol stations, 39 Forum Sport stores and 221 IF perfume stores. Today, X-Fab France SAS is headquartered here and operates a semiconductor fabrication plant. In 1999 it was transferred into a joint venture between IBM and Infineon, operating under the name Altis Semiconductor(fr). In 2010 it was sold to Yazid Sabeg for one symbolic Euro. Founded by Michel Leclercq in 1976, Decathlon started with a store in Lille, France. The company expanded abroad a decade later: to Germany in 1986, Spain in 1992, Italy in 1993, Belgium in 1997, Portugal, the United Kingdom in 1999, Brazil in 2001, China in 2003, India in 2009, Turkey and Czech Republic in 2010, Taiwan in 2012, Hong Kong in 2013, Malaysia and Singapore in 2016, South Africa, Philippines and Indonesia in 2017 in South Korea and Australia in 2018, and Canada in 2019.

Pseudotsuga is a genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the family Pinaceae (subfamily Laricoideae). Common names for species in the genus include Douglas fir, Douglas-fir, Douglas tree, Oregon pine and Bigcone spruce. The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged. Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in Pinus, Picea, Abies, Tsuga, and even Sequoia.

The number of species has long been debated, but two in western North America and two to four in eastern Asia are commonly acknowledged. Nineteenth-century botanists had problems in classifying Douglas firs, due to the species' similarity to various other conifers better known at the time; they have at times been classified in Pinus, Picea, Abies, Tsuga, and even Sequoia.

The prosecution at Nuremberg rejected that assertion and successfully argued that the Waffen-SS was an integral part of the SS apparatus.

In 2008, 20-year-old Salakhetdin Azizov from Tajikistan was attacked as he walked across a stretch of wasteland in South Moscow. A group calling themselves \"The Militant Organization of Russian Nationalists\" claimed responsibility for the murder and demanded stricter immigration laws.

After being discharged following Germany's defeat, Jeckeln worked as an engineer before joining the Nazi Party on 1 October 1929. In January 1931, he was accepted into the Schutzstaffel (SS). Political opponents, especially members of the KPD, SPD and the unions, were pursued relentlessly until their death. Together with party member Friedrich Alpers, Jeckeln was primarily responsible for the Rieseberg Murders in the summer of 1933. The Azov Battalion has been described as a far-right militia with connections to neo-Nazism, with members wearing neo-Nazi and SS symbols and regalia and expressing neo-Nazi views. The group's insignia features the Wolfsangel and the Black Sun,   two neo-Nazi symbols.Azov soldiers have been observed wearing Nazi-associated symbols on their uniforms. In 2014, the German ZDF television network showed images of Azov fighters wearing helmets with swastika symbols and \"the SS runes of Hitler's infamous black-uniformed elite corps\".

The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka. In the first of a three part essay titled \"McLuhan, Youth, and Literature\", Cameron labeled Charlie \"one of the most tasteless books ever written for children,\" finding it to be \"sadistic\" and \"phony.\" She was especially chagrined at its use as a classroom read-aloud. Dahl replied in the February 1973 issue of Horn Book. He also scoffed at her recommendation that teachers find better literature to share with their students: \"I would dearly like to see Ms. Cameron trying to read \n\n his hands, but not love from him moving forward. And the latter played a major role to prove his innocence. The philosophy of the book is summed up: \"Sometimes one has suffered so much that he has the right never to be able to say, ‘I am too happy.’\" (p. 204 The Black Tulip). The novel was originally published in three volumes in 1850 as La Tulipe Noire by Baudry (Paris). A similarity of story may be seen in The Count of Monte Cristo by same author. This book was officially printed in France by Alexandre Dumas in 1850 and originally had 236 pages but soon it was converted into different sizes thus changing the pages. This book features the adventures of Charlie as he listens to tales from his grandfather which have been saved in his Magic Story Chest. The book, like Schmidt's other children's novels, has a \"realistic, modern setting\" —Pluk drives a little truck and has a difficult time finding a place to live—but his world is full of fairy-tale creatures, such as, in this case, talking cockroaches, pigeons, and seagulls; horses of record-length; extinct fantastical birds; and a werewolf who operates a ferry. In its combining reality and magic, Pluk is often mentioned alongside Roald Dahl's The BFG. ; Egg on Mao: The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship was published in 2009 by Random House Canada. With assistance from Kotzwinkle's wife, Elizabeth Gundy, they devised a story about a dog who overcomes two burglars with his smelly farts. The book was a success and reached the top of The New York Times children's best seller list. It was published in the US in October 2006 by Random House as part of the Everyman Library. The present volume includes for the first time all the stories in chronological order as established by Dahl's biographer, Jeremy Treglown, in consultation with the Dahl estate. The collection contains all of the short stories published in the following collections:\n\n Women, or Robinson Crusoe for that matter to a class of today's children. In her essay, Cameron also decried the Oompa-Loompas, who were portrayed as abused, half-naked, African pygmy slaves. Though this appeared to be a direct result of Cameron's criticism, the brief amount of time between the criticism and the publication of the revised edition of Charlie makes it more likely that the changes had already been put in motion by the time \"McLuhan, Youth, and Literature\" was published.\n\nQuestion: How many copies of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote sold?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the first of a three part essay titled \"McLuhan, Youth, and Literature\", Cameron labeled Charlie \"one of the most tasteless books ever written for children,\" finding it to be \"sadistic\" and \"phony.\" She was especially chagrined at its use as a classroom read-aloud. Dahl replied in the February 1973 issue of Horn Book. He also scoffed at her recommendation that teachers find better literature to share with their students: \"I would dearly like to see Ms. Cameron trying to read \n\n his hands, but not love from him moving forward. And the latter played a major role to prove his innocence. The philosophy of the book is summed up: \"Sometimes one has suffered so much that he has the right never to be able to say, ‘I am too happy.’\" (p. 204 The Black Tulip). The novel was originally published in three volumes in 1850 as La Tulipe Noire by Baudry (Paris). A similarity of story may be seen in The Count of Monte Cristo by same author. This book was officially printed in France by Alexandre Dumas in 1850 and originally had 236 pages but soon it was converted into different sizes thus changing the pages. This book features the adventures of Charlie as he listens to tales from his grandfather which have been saved in his Magic Story Chest. The book, like Schmidt's other children's novels, has a \"realistic, modern setting\" —Pluk drives a little truck and has a difficult time finding a place to live—but his world is full of fairy-tale creatures, such as, in this case, talking cockroaches, pigeons, and seagulls; horses of record-length; extinct fantastical birds; and a werewolf who operates a ferry. In its combining reality and magic, Pluk is often mentioned alongside Roald Dahl's The BFG. ; Egg on Mao: The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship was published in 2009 by Random House Canada. With assistance from Kotzwinkle's wife, Elizabeth Gundy, they devised a story about a dog who overcomes two burglars with his smelly farts. The book was a success and reached the top of The New York Times children's best seller list. It was published in the US in October 2006 by Random House as part of the Everyman Library. The present volume includes for the first time all the stories in chronological order as established by Dahl's biographer, Jeremy Treglown, in consultation with the Dahl estate. The collection contains all of the short stories published in the following collections:\n\n Women, or Robinson Crusoe for that matter to a class of today's children. In her essay, Cameron also decried the Oompa-Loompas, who were portrayed as abused, half-naked, African pygmy slaves. Though this appeared to be a direct result of Cameron's criticism, the brief amount of time between the criticism and the publication of the revised edition of Charlie makes it more likely that the changes had already been put in motion by the time \"McLuhan, Youth, and Literature\" was published.\n\n"

It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and a specific gravity of 2. It occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal veins and in serpentinized ultramafic rocks. Associated minerals include brucite, hydromagnesite, pyroaurite, chrysotile, aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite. Calcium hydroxide (traditionally called slaked lime) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Ca(OH)2. It is a colorless crystal or white powder and is produced when quicklime (calcium oxide) is mixed or slaked with water. Bismutite or bismuthite is a bismuth carbonate mineral with formula Bi2(CO3)O2 (bismuth subcarbonate). Bismutite occurs as an oxidation product of other bismuth minerals such as bismuthinite and native bismuth in hydrothermal veins and pegmatites. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and typically occurs as earthy to fibrous masses. Krotite is a natural mineral composed of calcium, aluminium and oxygen, with the molecular formula CaAl2O4. Krotite was reported in 2011 in a calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion (CAI) in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorite NWA (North West Africa) 1934, which landed in Morocco. The mineral name was approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA 2010-038) and honors Alexander N. Krot, a researcher in cosmochemistry at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, Hawaii. Researchers have found that the mineral, which has the same atomic arrangement as a man-made component of some types of concrete, forms under low pressure at a temperature of at least 1500 C. These conditions of high temperature and low pressure are consistent with a hypothesis that the \n\nWater with a hardness level of around 150-300 mg/liter is classified as hard water. These minerals are typically dissolved in the water as it travels through natural deposits like limestone and gypsum. The classification of water as hard is determined by the concentration of minerals present. Hardness is typically measured in terms of milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) equivalent. This process can reduce the hardness of water and prevent limescale buildup. Hydroxyapatite, also called hydroxylapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca5(PO4)3(OH), but it is usually written Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. The OH− ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of dental fluorosis. Up to 50% by volume and 70% by weight of human bone is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, known as bone mineral. The hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below: 10 Ca(OH)2 + 6 H3PO4 → Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 18 H2O The ability to synthetically replicate hydroxyapatite has invaluable clinical implications, especially in dentistry. Stoichiometric apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness.

Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet is a 1965 American science fiction film, one of two versions adapted for Roger Corman from the Soviet science fiction movie Planeta Bur (Planet of Storms), scripted by Aleksandr Kazantsev from his novel and directed by Pavel Klushantsev. The resulting new film was then syndicated to television by American-International Television Inc.\n\n Roger Corman purchased the rights to Planet of Storms (a Soviet film Planeta Bur) and used footage from that movie to make this movie and Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women. The American-made scenes were shot at the same time as Queen of Blood, another film directed by Harrington that was developed around the story of, and footage from, Soviet science fiction films. Basil Rathbone and Faith Domergue shot their scenes in half a day using the same costumes and on the same set as Queen of Blood. The aliens from the planet Remulak aboard, Beldar Clorhone and his \"genetomate\", Prymaat, survive and quickly adapt to the human way of life, despite standing out with their conical-shaped heads and metallic-sounding voices. This expensive, lavish Technicolor production of plaster Grecian temples and painted skies was Wanger's second attempt to film the novel, and ended up costing $1.6 million and losing Universal some $800,000. In a small Bulgarian provincial town during the 1980s, factory worker Vasil 'Vasko' Georgiev (Hristo Mutafchiev) has problems with the local Communist Party agent (Nikolai Urumov) who wants Vasko to monitor and report on the activities of his father-in-law, Bai Dan (Miki Manojlović). Facing a moral dilemma, Vasko decides to emigrate beyond the Iron Curtain to Western Europe with his wife Yana (Ana Papadopulu) and his son Aleksander 'Sashko' (played as a child by Blagovest Mutafchiev). The family succeeds in crossing the border to Italy but face the prospect of lengthy detention in a bleak refugee camp until \n\n The entirety of the film takes place within the course of one day in the summer of 1936 in the Soviet Union. After witnessing Mitya contemplate suicide, the film cuts to Comdiv Sergei Petrovich Kotov, his wife Maroussia, and their young six-year-old daughter Nadia relaxing in a banya when a peasant from the local collective farm frantically tells them the Red Army's tanks are about to crush the wheat harvest as part of general maneuvers. Kotov carries authority as a senior Old Bolshevik and legendary hero of the 1917 \n\n Upon the film's release in the United States in 1962, the New York Times wrote of it positively, saying: “As a co-production of the Leningrad and Frunze Film Studios, the picture certainly moves [...]. The dancers go to town, and for once (on screen, anyway) a ballet heroine, Reina Chokoyeva, conveys real terror. But the incredibly mercurial Bibisara Beishenalieva, as the sorcerer, goes the whole company one better by suggesting that she's about to take off into space.”\n\n"

In 1588 the Parisian Parlement decreed that a torch be installed and lit \n\n Moore had devised his glow discharge lighting system by 1896. The Moore lamps utilized nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas; Moore's innovation compensated for the gradual loss of gas in the lamp to the electrodes and the glass. The lamp yielded about 10 lumens per watt, \n\n In 1921 Francis Everard Lamplough (an engineer with AGA's rival firm in lighthouse provision: Chance Brothers) patented an alternative 'light valve' in the hope of breaking Dalén's effective monopoly. In subsequent years it was installed on several lighthouses and beacons, but because of its dependence on liquid it could only be used in static locations (unlike Dalén's valves, very many of which were installed on floating buoys). The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant. While the lamps proved useful in many applications, the problem of safely storing acetylene meant they needed regular refilling which constrained their use in applications such as lighthouses. The Centennial Light was originally a 30-watt (or 60-watt ) bulb, but is now very dim, emitting about the same light as a 4-watt nightlight. That story \n\n raised it to the height of 100 feet including the lantern room at the top in which the lights were kept. (To prevent accidents from fire the lantern room was coated with copper as was also the gallery around it; this gallery used to be much frequented by the visitors to Margate on account of the extensive views.) At the same time oil lamps were installed in the tower, together with a new optical system designed by Thomas Rogers (who had previously installed a similar system in the lower lighthouse at Portland): it consisted of two rows of nine lamps and reflectors arranged in a convex curve, placed behind a row of solid glass convex lenses which were incorporated within the glazing around the lantern room. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, in partnership with Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century. The Argand lamp was a significant innovation in lighting technology, characterized by its use of a cylindrical wick and glass chimney. It provided a brighter and more efficient light compared to previous oil lamps. Aimé Argand's invention greatly contributed to the improvement of illumination during the late 18th century. In the 1850s the light was provided from a burning wick in a whale oil lamp. Later, as kerosene became available, the light was provided by burning kerosene. They typically used an Argand lamp which featured a hollow wick in a glass chimney for better, brighter, combustion with a silvered parabolic reflector behind the lamp to direct and intensify the light output. All oil fired lamps used burning wicks to make the light—giving rise to one of the lighthouse keeper's nickname as \"wickies\" as they spent a great deal of their time trimming the wicks on \n\n The source of illumination had generally been wood pyres or burning coal but this was expensive, some lighthouses consuming 400 tons of coal a year. Smeaton's Eddystone lighthouse used 24 candles until 1810.

In 1588 the Parisian Parlement decreed that a torch be installed and lit \n\n Moore had devised his glow discharge lighting system by 1896. The Moore lamps utilized nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the luminous gas; Moore's innovation compensated for the gradual loss of gas in the lamp to the electrodes and the glass. The lamp yielded about 10 lumens per watt, \n\n In 1921 Francis Everard Lamplough (an engineer with AGA's rival firm in lighthouse provision: Chance Brothers) patented an alternative 'light valve' in the hope of breaking Dalén's effective monopoly. In subsequent years it was installed on several lighthouses and beacons, but because of its dependence on liquid it could only be used in static locations (unlike Dalén's valves, very many of which were installed on floating buoys). The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant. While the lamps proved useful in many applications, the problem of safely storing acetylene meant they needed regular refilling which constrained their use in applications such as lighthouses. The Centennial Light was originally a 30-watt (or 60-watt ) bulb, but is now very dim, emitting about the same light as a 4-watt nightlight. That story \n\n raised it to the height of 100 feet including the lantern room at the top in which the lights were kept. (To prevent accidents from fire the lantern room was coated with copper as was also the gallery around it; this gallery used to be much frequented by the visitors to Margate on account of the extensive views.) At the same time oil lamps were installed in the tower, together with a new optical system designed by Thomas Rogers (who had previously installed a similar system in the lower lighthouse at Portland): it consisted of two rows of nine lamps and reflectors arranged in a convex curve, placed behind a row of solid glass convex lenses which were incorporated within the glazing around the lantern room. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, in partnership with Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century. The Argand lamp was a significant innovation in lighting technology, characterized by its use of a cylindrical wick and glass chimney. It provided a brighter and more efficient light compared to previous oil lamps. Aimé Argand's invention greatly contributed to the improvement of illumination during the late 18th century. In the 1850s the light was provided from a burning wick in a whale oil lamp. Later, as kerosene became available, the light was provided by burning kerosene. They typically used an Argand lamp which featured a hollow wick in a glass chimney for better, brighter, combustion with a silvered parabolic reflector behind the lamp to direct and intensify the light output. All oil fired lamps used burning wicks to make the light—giving rise to one of the lighthouse keeper's nickname as \"wickies\" as they spent a great deal of their time trimming the wicks on \n\n The source of illumination had generally been wood pyres or burning coal but this was expensive, some lighthouses consuming 400 tons of coal a year. Smeaton's Eddystone lighthouse used 24 candles until 1810. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame.\n\n"

The Japanese had captured the bastion from the United States Army Forces in the Far East during their 1942 invasion. The retaking of the island, officially named Fort Mills, along with the bloody Battle of Manila and the earlier Battle of Bataan, marked the redemption of the American and Filipino surrender on 6 May 1942 and the subsequent fall of the Philippines. The surrender of Corregidor in 1942 \n\n The Battle of Visayas (Filipino: Labanan sa Visayas; Visayan languages: Gubat sa Kabisay-an) was fought by U.S. forces and Filipino guerrillas against the Japanese from 18 March – 15 August 1945, in a series of actions officially designated as Operations Victor I and II, and part of the campaign for the liberation of the Philippines during World War II. The battle was waged to complete the recapture of the central portions south of the archipelago and secure them from remaining Japanese forces.

The battle saw 8,000 American combatants killed, or as many as 10,000 in the entire conflict. However, to these staggering losses, there must also be added the over 150,000 Filipinos killed, many during the Battle of Manila, but with an overwhelmingly number of Filipino civilians murdered by Japanese forces, as a result of the Manila massacre of February, 1945.

Established in 1978 by long-standing Hollywood Foreign Press Association member, Maureen Dragone, the Youth in Film Association was the first organization to establish an awards ceremony specifically set to recognize and award the contributions of performers under the age of 18 in the fields of film, television, theater and music. She received a second Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Supporting Actress, for her performance as a Fox News employee in Bombshell (2019). Robbie has also produced several projects, including the Hulu television series Dollface (2019–present), the film Promising Young Woman (2020), and the Netflix miniseries Maid (2021).\n\n"

It was allowed this time, according to Konietzko, after he complained about seeing a shot of SpongeBob SquarePants, another Nickelodeon character, similarly restrained. The third season of the animated television series The Legend of Korra, titled Book Three: Change, was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and consists of thirteen episodes (\"chapters\"), all animated by Studio Mir. The season takes place largely in the Earth Kingdom, one of the four major nations in the setting of the series, while depicting the re-emergence of airbending among people of other nations. The season's antagonists are the \"Red Lotus\", a group of dangerous anarchists led by the new airbender Zaheer who wants to overthrow the world's governments and the Avatar. Despondent, Korra establishes spiritual contact with her predecessor Aang, who restores her bending powers, allowing her to do the same to Amon's other victims. The story follows Korra's friends' efforts to win support for the southern tribe in Republic City, and Korra's quest to foil Unalaq's plans while learning about spirits. New characters introduced in this season include Unalaq and his children Desna and Eska; Kya and Bumi, the siblings of Korra's mentor Tenzin; Varrick, an eccentric and wealthy inventor and businessman from the Southern Water Tribe. Also according to Konietzko, beginning with Book Three, the series became a more visible property and was able to retain more well-known actors. Anne Heche auditioned and was cast for Suyin Beifong, Lin's estranged sister, and Jon Heder auditioned for the minor role of the apathetic adolescent airbender Ryu. Henry Rollins expressed interest for auditioning for the role of the season's main antagonist Zaheer, calling Konietzko and DiMartino from a tour to pose questions about the character. Created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the character was voiced by Mako in the first two seasons and, due to Mako's death, by Greg Baldwin in the third season and the sequel series The Legend of Korra. Troy Island Mell, of IGN, felt that the story \"would [not] be anywhere near as good as it is without its ability to create such strong characters\". In particular, Mell enjoyed the development of Katara and Zuko throughout the first season, but thought that Zuko's relationship with his uncle was not \"very organic.\" Rich also praised the fact that, unlike many cartoon television series, Avatar introduces antagonists that have a deep backstory and \"are [not] just evil for the \n\n between Bolin and Varrick, the sibling dynamic of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi, a \"strong, complex conflict\" for Korra, the respective relationship of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi, and Korra, Tonraq, and Senna as the heart of the story, and the twist behind Tonraq's banishment from the Northern Water Tribe and his imprisonment. According to him, \"Night of a Thousand Stars\" brought out the best of Bolin and the worst of Varrick, as well as setting up the conflict for the last three episodes of Book 2. For \"Harmonic Convergence\", Nicholson praised its spectacular action sequences, fleshing out more on Unalaq's intriguing evil purpose, the heroism of Bumi, and the animation. Writing for The Escapist, Mike Hoffman noted how the series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing, but also giving emotional weight to the death of major characters, including \"one of the most brutal and sudden deaths in children's television\" in the case of P'Li in season 3. By portraying Korra's opponents, including the Red Lotus, not as stereotypical villains but as human beings with understandable motivations corrupted by an excess of zeal, the series trusted in viewers to be able to \"resolve the dissonance between understanding someone's view and disagreeing with their methods\". And, Hoffman wrote, by showing Korra to suffer from \"full-on depression\" at the end of the third season, and devoting much of the fourth to her recovery, the series helped normalize mental health issues, a theme generally unaddressed in children's television, which made them less oppressive for the viewers.\n\nQuestion: What season was the character introduced that becomes the main antagonist in the  following season, from the animated television series created by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino as a sequel to \"\", which aired from 2005 to 2008? \nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The season takes place largely in the Earth Kingdom, one of the four major nations in the setting of the series, while depicting the re-emergence of airbending among people of other nations. The season's antagonists are the \"Red Lotus\", a group of dangerous anarchists led by the new airbender Zaheer who wants to overthrow the world's governments and the Avatar. Despondent, Korra establishes spiritual contact with her predecessor Aang, who restores her bending powers, allowing her to do the same to Amon's other victims. The story follows Korra's friends' efforts to win support for the southern tribe in Republic City, and Korra's quest to foil Unalaq's plans while learning about spirits. New characters introduced in this season include Unalaq and his children Desna and Eska; Kya and Bumi, the siblings of Korra's mentor Tenzin; Varrick, an eccentric and wealthy inventor and businessman from the Southern Water Tribe. Also according to Konietzko, beginning with Book Three, the series became a more visible property and was able to retain more well-known actors. Anne Heche auditioned and was cast for Suyin Beifong, Lin's estranged sister, and Jon Heder auditioned for the minor role of the apathetic adolescent airbender Ryu. Henry Rollins expressed interest for auditioning for the role of the season's main antagonist Zaheer, calling Konietzko and DiMartino from a tour to pose questions about the character. Created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, the character was voiced by Mako in the first two seasons and, due to Mako's death, by Greg Baldwin in the third season and the sequel series The Legend of Korra. Troy Island Mell, of IGN, felt that the story \"would [not] be anywhere near as good as it is without its ability to create such strong characters\". In particular, Mell enjoyed the development of Katara and Zuko throughout the first season, but thought that Zuko's relationship with his uncle was not \"very organic.\" Rich also praised the fact that, unlike many cartoon television series, Avatar introduces antagonists that have a deep backstory and \"are [not] just evil for the \n\n between Bolin and Varrick, the sibling dynamic of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi, a \"strong, complex conflict\" for Korra, the respective relationship of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi, and Korra, Tonraq, and Senna as the heart of the story, and the twist behind Tonraq's banishment from the Northern Water Tribe and his imprisonment. According to him, \"Night of a Thousand Stars\" brought out the best of Bolin and the worst of Varrick, as well as setting up the conflict for the last three episodes of Book 2. For \"Harmonic Convergence\", Nicholson praised its spectacular action sequences, fleshing out more on Unalaq's intriguing evil purpose, the heroism of Bumi, and the animation. Writing for The Escapist, Mike Hoffman noted how the series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing, but also giving emotional weight to the death of major characters, including \"one of the most brutal and sudden deaths in children's television\" in the case of P'Li in season 3. By portraying Korra's opponents, including the Red Lotus, not as stereotypical villains but as human beings with understandable motivations corrupted by an excess of zeal, the series trusted in viewers to be able to \"resolve the dissonance between understanding someone's view and disagreeing with their methods\". And, Hoffman wrote, by showing Korra to suffer from \"full-on depression\" at the end of the third season, and devoting much of the fourth to her recovery, the series helped normalize mental health issues, a theme generally unaddressed in children's television, which made them less oppressive for the viewers.\n\n"

Such mathematicians as Lev Pontryagin, who made major contributions to topology and functional analysis and a founder of the modern optimal control theory, Andrey Tychonoff, who was the author of the \"central theorem\" of general topology, Pavel Alexandrov, a very important figure in topology of the 20th century, and many others made fundamental contributions to different fields of mathematics. Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with Fields Medal, a most prestigious award in mathematics. This example disproved the Pierre Fatou conjecture and was unexpected to most mathematicians at that time. Together with his student Mikhail Yakovlevich Suslin, he developed the theory of analytic sets. He also made contributions to complex analysis, the theory of differential equations, and numerical methods.\n\n"

Historically, French Canadians had among the highest birth rates in world history, explaining their relatively large population despite low immigration rates from France. These immigrants mainly settled in Québec and Acadia, although some eventually inhabited Ontario and Manitoba. Many of the first French-Canadian migrants to the U.S. worked in the New England lumber industry, and, to a lesser degree, in the burgeoning mining industry in the upper Great Lakes. This initial wave of seasonal migration was then followed by more permanent relocation in the United States by French-Canadian millworkers. Over the next generation, some four thousand managed to make the long trek to Louisiana, where they began a new life. They were overwhelmingly Catholic, spoke Colonial French (although some also spoke Louisiana Creole) and kept up many French social customs, modified by other parts of their ancestry and Louisiana culture. Though many of the veterans sold their claim in this vast region, some remained and the settlement held. In 1755 the British forcibly exiled the French-speaking Acadians; approximately 11,500 were exiled in total. Most of the exiled Acadians who managed to survive traveled to Louisiana, where their descendants are known as Cajuns. Shunned by a Francophobic population, the Acadians had to rely upon themselves to better their own conditions.

The Acadia region to which modern Cajuns trace their origin consisted largely of what are now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island plus parts of eastern Quebec and northern Maine. Since their establishment in Louisiana, the Cajuns have become famous for their unique French dialect, Louisiana French (also called \"Cajun French\", although the dialect predates the Acadians' arrival in Louisiana), and have developed a vibrant culture including folkways, music, and cuisine. The Acadiana region is heavily associated with them. In the rest of the Maritimes, the British had previously expelled many of the French colonists of Acadia in 1755 to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population, but this would not be repeated in 1763.

Brasenia is a perennial aquatic plant with floating, peltate leaves and rhizomatous stems. Bupleurum is a large genus of annual or perennial herbs or woody shrubs, with about 190 species, belonging to the family Apiaceae. Their compound umbels of small flowers are adorned with bracteoles that are sometimes large and may play a role in attracting pollinators. Rare among the Apiaceae are the simple leaves, bracts (if present), and bracteoles. The genus is almost exclusively native in the Old World Northern Hemisphere, with one species native to North America and one species native to southern Africa. Cortinarius is a very widespread genus of agarics, but also contains some secotioid species, such as C. leucocephalus, C. coneae and C. cartilagineus. It was originally assigned to Secotium and later to a more specific secotioid genus Nivatogastrium, but in fact it is closely allied to Pholiota squarrosa and it has now been moved to genus Pholiota itself, although the latter consists primarily of agarics. Agaricus deserticola is a secotioid species of Agaricus (the genus of common cultivated mushrooms) which at one time was placed in the genus Secotium. Similarly, Agaricus inapertus was formerly known as Endoptychum depressum until molecular analysis revealed it to be closely aligned with Agaricus. B. nymphoides, B. peltata) has the common name water-shield (also watershield or water shield). The genus may commemorate the surgeon and Moravian missionary Christoph Brasen (1738-1774), who was the first superintendent of the Moravian mission at Nain in Labrador. Hymenachne is a genus of widespread wetlands plants that is in the grass family. A species from the Americas, H. amplexicaulis, is well known in other parts of the world as an introduced and invasive species. Hymenachne is similar to genus Sacciolepis. Hymenachne aquatic plants frequently found in marshes and other wet habitats. Their stems are spongy with aerenchyma tissue. They are perennial, sometimes with rhizomes. Schizaea is a small genus of specialized ferns in the family Schizaeaceae. Some species are very small and inconspicuous, and so may often be overlooked in nature. The genus is distinctive and not at all like the common conception of a fern, though it is still considered a true fern (leptosporangiate). Various of the roughly two dozen species have been reported from widely separated regions, including much of the tropical Old and New World, parts of the Eastern USA, Chile, the Falkland Islands, and various Pacific islands, including several islands of New Caledonia, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Species in the genus Marstonia are distributed in springs, streams and lakes in eastern North America. Polystichum is a genus of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae, subfamily Dryopteridoideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I).

Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., 344 U.S. 392 (1953), (the MPAS case) was a 1953 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that, where exclusive output contracts used by one company \"and the three other major companies have foreclosed to competitors 75 percent of all available outlets for this business throughout the United States\" the practice is \"a device which has sewed up a market so tightly for the benefit of a few [that it] falls within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, and is therefore an 'unfair method of competition' \" under § 5 of the FTC Act. In so ruling, the Court extended the analysis under § 3 of the Clayton Act of requirements contracts that it made in the Standard Stations case to output contracts brought under the Sherman or FTC Acts. According to the Supreme Court of the United States, if a federal law arbitrates activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, then that law complies with the Commerce Clause. Valentine Goesaert, the plaintiff in the case, challenged the law on the ground that it infringed on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., 344 U.S. 392 (1953), (the MPAS case) was a 1953 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that, where exclusive output contracts used by one company \"and the three other major companies have foreclosed to competitors 75 percent of all available outlets for this business throughout the United States\" the practice is \"a device which has sewed up a market so tightly for the benefit of a few [that it] falls within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, and is therefore an 'unfair method of competition' \" under § 5 of the FTC Act.

At times an independent institution, and at times part of another institution, it is, as of 2021, part of North Central College in Naperville, Illinois. Founded in 1853 as the Mount Carroll Seminary in Mount Carroll, Illinois, the school became affiliated with the University of Chicago in 1896 and was renamed the Frances Shimer Academy after founder Frances Wood Shimer. It was renamed Shimer College in 1950, when it began offering a four-year curriculum based on the Hutchins Plan of the University of Chicago. After the University of Chicago parted with both the College and the Hutchins Plan in 1958, Shimer continued to use a version of that curriculum. The college relocated to Waukegan \n\n After graduation he was appointed instructor of classics at Lake Forest University in Lake Forest Illinois, a new college in the northern suburbs of Chicago that was meant to be a competitor of  Northwestern University in Evanston. Within his first couple of years he would write articles for a college journal called the Lake Forest University Review, on his views of the classics and would eventually become editor. Unfortunately the main funding behind the Lake Forest University Review was from the prior editor so it went defunct within a year of Kelsey being \n\n Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, England. In high school Dr. Cushman didn’t have a drive or reason to succeed academically, until he found a class he enjoyed because of the teacher. He went on to Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana where he majored in Zoology and minored in Chemistry. His tenacious attitude gave him the boost to get magna cum laude. He was a first-generation college student in his family and grew up poor. He also stated that growing up poor is what made him strive for better, stating “being poor is a great stimulus for wanting to achieve something.” After earning his Ph.D. in 1966 from the University of Illinois, Dr. Cushman joined the Squibb Institute for Medical Research. His and Dr. Ondetti's research began with the Brazilian pit viper, \n\nAlbion College ; Allegheny College ; Antioch College ; Denison University ; DePauw University ; Earlham College ; Hope College ; Kalamazoo College ; Kenyon College ; Oberlin College ; Ohio Wesleyan University ; Wabash College ; College of Wooster The Great Lakes Colleges Association (GLCA) is a consortium of 13 liberal arts colleges located in the states around the Great Lakes.

Its stated mission is to take actions that will help strengthen \n\n who was a creditor of the seminary. In 1864, the overcrowded school began accepting female students only. To ensure the seminary's long-term survival, in 1896 Frances Shimer reached an agreement with the University of Chicago in which the school became the Frances Shimer Academy of the University of Chicago and was loosely affiliated with the Baptist Church.

Prohormones are substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body, providing similar benefits to taking anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) without the legal risks associated with them. They are often used to enhance muscle growth, increase strength and power, improve athletic performance, and accelerate recovery from intense training or injuries. These compounds are believed to undergo enzymatic changes within the body, converting into active hormones that interact with androgen receptors to produce anabolic effects. By mimicking the actions of AAS, prohormones aim to enhance muscle protein synthesis, promote nitrogen retention, and inhibit muscle breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and improved physical performance. One of the advantages of using prohormones for bodybuilders and athletes is the legal aspect.

To say the play lacks the complex poignance of the 'Sunday in the Park with George' and 'Into the Woods' librettist's best work wouldn't be fair; however wry Hart's humor or complicated his relationships — with show business, his family, other people — his 'Act One' is a nostalgic and ultimately upbeat reflection on fulfilling a dream....Lapine captures that essence and the period, on the page and on the stage.\" The play received nominations for five Tony Awards, with Beowulf Boritt winning for what Playbill called his \"captivating, multi-level set design, built on a large-scale revolve...\"\n\n"

Veracini was born in Florence, Italy, the eldest son of Francesco di Niccolò Veracini, a noted violinist who ran a music school, and from whom Antonio first learned to play the violin. When his father's health began to fail around 1708, Antonio took over the running of the school, where he taught the violin to (amongst others) his nephew Francesco Maria Veracini (1690–1768), later a celebrated violinist and composer in his own right. He did visit Rome on two occasions, where he is believed to have met Arcangelo Corelli, and in 1720 he briefly visited Vienna. Antonio Veracini died in 1733, aged 74. Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (, ;   ; 4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher, impresario, and Roman Catholic priest. Born in Venice, the capital of the Venetian Republic, Vivaldi is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers. Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. It originated in Northern Italy at the end of the 16th century, and the style migrated quickly to Germany, which was one of the most active centers of early Baroque music. The culmination of the Baroque era was undoubtedly in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel in the first half of the 18th century. His most famous works include the orchestral suites Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks and the oratorio Messiah. As a composer, he wrote sonatas for trombones (formerly known as sackbuts) and cornetti with basso continuo. Antonio Salieri was born on August 18, 1750, to Antonio Salieri and his wife, Anna Maria. Salieri started his musical studies in his native town of Legnago; he was first taught at home by his older brother Francesco Salieri (a former student of the violinist and composer Giuseppe Tartini), and he received further lessons from the organist of the Legnago Cathedral, Giuseppe Simoni, a pupil of Padre Giovanni Battista Martini. He twice ran away from home without permission to hear his elder brother play violin concertos in neighboring churches on festival days (resulting \n\n  From folk music to classical, music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music. Italians invented many of the musical instruments, including the piano and violin. Most notable Italians composers include the Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Claudio Monteverdi, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini, whose operas, including La bohème, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, and Turandot, are among the most frequently worldwide performed in the standard repertoire. Modern Italian \n\n Lolli, who was born about 1725 in Bergamo, Italy, was one of the foremost Italian violinists of the 18th century. Lolli died in Palermo, Sicily in 1802. His son, Filippo Lolli (born 1773 in Stuttgart, died unknown) earned renown as a cellist.

As a violinist nicknamed Carlo del Violino and Carluccio di Pamfili, he played the first violin in the most famous Roman musical ensemble of the period.

        "context": " Antonio Veracini (17 January 1659 &ndash; 26 October 1733) was an Italian composer and violinist of the Baroque era. Veracini was born in Florence, Italy, the eldest son of Francesco di Niccolò Veracini, a noted violinist who ran a music school, and from whom Antonio first learned to play the violin. When his father's health began to fail around 1708, Antonio took over the running of the school, where he taught the violin to (amongst others) his nephew Francesco Maria Veracini (1690–1768), later a celebrated violinist and composer in his own right. He did visit Rome on two occasions, where he is believed to have met Arcangelo Corelli, and in 1720 he briefly visited Vienna. Antonio Veracini died in 1733, aged 74. Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (, ;   ; 4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher, impresario, and Roman Catholic priest. Born in Venice, the capital of the Venetian Republic, Vivaldi is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers. Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. It originated in Northern Italy at the end of the 16th century, and the style migrated quickly to Germany, which was one of the most active centers of early Baroque music. The culmination of the Baroque era was undoubtedly in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel in the first half of the 18th century. His most famous works include the orchestral suites Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks and the oratorio Messiah. As a composer, he wrote sonatas for trombones (formerly known as sackbuts) and cornetti with basso continuo. Antonio Salieri was born on August 18, 1750, to Antonio Salieri and his wife, Anna Maria. Salieri started his musical studies in his native town of Legnago; he was first taught at home by his older brother Francesco Salieri (a former student of the violinist and composer Giuseppe Tartini), and he received further lessons from the organist of the Legnago Cathedral, Giuseppe Simoni, a pupil of Padre Giovanni Battista Martini. He twice ran away from home without permission to hear his elder brother play violin concertos in neighboring churches on festival days (resulting \n\n  From folk music to classical, music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, and many of the prevailing classical music forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, can trace their roots back to innovations of 16th- and 17th-century Italian music. Italians invented many of the musical instruments, including the piano and violin. Most notable Italians composers include the Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Claudio Monteverdi, the Baroque composers Scarlatti, Corelli and Vivaldi, the Classical composers Paganini and Rossini, and the Romantic composers Verdi and Puccini, whose operas, including La bohème, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, and Turandot, are among the most frequently worldwide performed in the standard repertoire. Modern Italian \n\n Lolli, who was born about 1725 in Bergamo, Italy, was one of the foremost Italian violinists of the 18th century. Lolli died in Palermo, Sicily in 1802.

The troll falls into the stream and is carried away by the current and drowned. One of the earliest is the story of the Goat's Bridge. As the story goes, an old goat herder was tending his goats by the river Miljacka when one of them started ferociously digging at a certain spot of the ground. With the gold, he then built a great bridge over the river that would for years be the main crossing for travelers \n\n  The Bilberry goat (Fiaghabhar na bhFraochán) is a breed of feral goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) which is believed to have lived in one herd on Bilberry Rock in Waterford City in the south of Ireland for hundreds of years. Locals believe they came over with the Huguenots from France over 300 years ago and have lived on Bilberry Rock ever since. The bridges are a measure for wildlife management and natural habitat preservation, and serve the functions of both animal welfare and accident prevention. Costs to construct squirrel bridges vary significantly, depending on construction.\n\n"

Emir Amanullah Khan signed the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 following the Third Anglo-Afghan War, gaining full Afghan independence. In 1926, Amanullah Khan reformed the country as the Kingdom of Afghanistan, becoming its first King. win this civil war and would go on to rule the realm until In 1878, the British had returned in the Second Anglo-Afghan War which was fought over perceived Russian influence in the region, Abdur Rahman Khan replaced Ayub Khan who had succeeded Sher Ali Khan after his death in 1879.

Modern Scots, Northumbrian, Cumbrian and North/East Riding dialects originate from Northumbrian. It was significantly different from the dialects spoken by other Kingdoms, especially that of West-Saxon (the primary dialect).

Because of the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is little to no salvaged written evidence for the development of non-Wessex dialects after Alfred the Great's unification, until the Middle English period. Northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast Scotland, including Edinburgh, and as far south as the Humber estuary.

Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. Marge praises Homer's actions, and he says he's going with his gut - or specifically his GUT (Give Up Trying) approach. Homer then sings Joe Esposito's \"You're the Best Around\" over the credits.\n\n"

The column is made entirely of white marble, and consists of an ornate rectangular pedestal that supports a Corinthian column bearing a gilded statue of the Virgin Mary, crowned with twelve stars and standing on the moon (a reference to Revelation 12:1). At its base, the column is surrounded by six saints, to which the townspeople prayed for intercession:  The monument was later surrounded by an ornamental stone fence. over the central door of the Trinity was sculpted by Pietro Bernini and Giovanni Battista Caccini. It was erected in 1565 to commemorate the Battle of Montemurlo in which Florence defeated Siena. In its original setting, Santa Reparata presented itself as a basilica with three naves, that were separated by fourteen pairs of columns. It had semi-circular apses, which could be dated to the end of the fourth century because of the typical paleo-Christian iconography of basilicas from the age of Constantine. Not all of the basilica was excavated; the first part, about four columns wide, were dug up underneath the church square and the stairway of Santa Maria del Fiore. The flat ceiling is coffered, gilded, and decorated with rosettes and has a painting of the Apotheosis of St. Lawrence in the central panel. Below the altar is \n\nSan Zanobi (Saint Zenobius of Florence) (337–417) first bishop of Florence. ; Zanobi da Strada (1300) Italian writer, translator and correspondent of Petrarch. ; Zanobi Strozzi (1400) assistant e pupil of Beato Angelico. ; Zanobi Machiavelli (1418–1479) Italian painter and illuminator. ; Zanobi Acciaiuoli (1461–1519) Italian Dominican friar, writer and translator. ; Zanobi Buondelmonti (1500) important Florentine public political in 1500, quoted by Niccolò Machiavelli and to which dedicated the work \"Discourses on Livy\". ; Zanobi Poggino (1500) Italian portrait painter, pupil of Giovanni Antonio Sogliani. ; Zanobi del Rosso (1700) Italian architect, pupil Giovanni Filippo Ciocchi. The bones of Saint Zenobius (born about 328) were transferred to Santa Reparata at an unidentified time (according to most scientists it happened in the 9th century).

The column is made entirely of white marble, and consists of an ornate rectangular pedestal that supports a Corinthian column bearing a gilded statue of the Virgin Mary, crowned with twelve stars and standing on the moon (a reference to Revelation 12:1). At its base, the column is surrounded by six saints, to which the townspeople prayed for intercession:  The monument was later surrounded by an ornamental stone fence. over the central door of the Trinity was sculpted by Pietro Bernini and Giovanni Battista Caccini. It was erected in 1565 to commemorate the Battle of Montemurlo in which Florence defeated Siena. In its original setting, Santa Reparata presented itself as a basilica with three naves, that were separated by fourteen pairs of columns. It had semi-circular apses, which could be dated to the end of the fourth century because of the typical paleo-Christian iconography of basilicas from the age of Constantine. Not all of the basilica was excavated; the first part, about four columns wide, were dug up underneath the church square and the stairway of Santa Maria del Fiore. The flat ceiling is coffered, gilded, and decorated with rosettes and has a painting of the Apotheosis of St. Lawrence in the central panel. Below the altar is \n\nSan Zanobi (Saint Zenobius of Florence) (337–417) first bishop of Florence. ; Zanobi da Strada (1300) Italian writer, translator and correspondent of Petrarch. ; Zanobi Strozzi (1400) assistant e pupil of Beato Angelico. ; Zanobi Machiavelli (1418–1479) Italian painter and illuminator. ; Zanobi Acciaiuoli (1461–1519) Italian Dominican friar, writer and translator. ; Zanobi Buondelmonti (1500) important Florentine public political in 1500, quoted by Niccolò Machiavelli and to which dedicated the work \"Discourses on Livy\". ; Zanobi Poggino (1500) Italian portrait painter, pupil of Giovanni Antonio Sogliani. ; Zanobi del Rosso (1700) Italian architect, pupil Giovanni Filippo Ciocchi.

Solidago villosicarpa was first collected in 1949, misidentified for several decades, and described as a new species in 2000. It is a perennial herb that can grow to 1.5 meters (5 meet) tall. Solidago verna is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names springflowering goldenrod and spring goldenrod. The serrated leaves are up to 16 centimeters (6.4 inches) long and are borne on winged petioles. This species is the only goldenrod in the region that blooms in spring.

Maas himself was a significant figure in the New York avant-garde world of the 1950s and 1960s; Edward Albee used Maas and his wife, experimental filmmaker Marie Menken, as the models for his lead characters in the early masterwork, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" The Stanley Drama Award, which began as a prize given at the conclusion of the NYC Writers Conference, has provided encouragement for several notable playwrights, including: Terrence McNally for \"This Side of the Door\" (1962), an early version of \"And Things that Go Bump in the Night\"; Adrienne Kennedy for \"Funnyhouse of a Negro\" (1963); Lonne Elder III for an early version of \"The Ceremonies in Dark Old Men\" (1965), and Jonathan Larson in 1993 for an early version of \"Rent.\" Mrs. Barker responds to each inquiry in the same way: “I don’t mind if I do.” Albee is showing us the trauma of repetition: the noxious glue that holds his married couples together, despite their rage—or because of it.\" The Zoo Story is a one-act play by American playwright Edward Albee. His first play, it was written in 1958 and completed in just three weeks. Today, professional theatre companies can produce The Zoo Story either as a part of Edward Albee's at Home at the Zoo (originally titled Peter and Jerry), or as a standalone play. Great American playwright Edward Albee mines the ins and outs of the dysfunctional family in his body of work, which includes Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Three Tall Women, and, most recently, The Goat. \"They were marvellous! But, as I read them, I suddenly remembered the pictures I had seen of Noel Coward sitting up in a wonderful looking bed, in an even more wonderful dressing-gown, a silver tray at his side, reading his notices!\n\n"

With the development of graduated education, Rutgers College was renamed Rutgers University in 1924. Originally established as a private institution affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church, it is now a secular institution and became New Jersey's leading state university of New Jersey under legislation passed in 1945 and 1956.

On July 1, 2013, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School was officially merged back into Rutgers University, along with most of the other schools of UMDNJ, with the exception of the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine. The campus is named after Charles L. Busch (1902–1971), of Edgewater, New Jersey, an eccentric millionaire, who unexpectedly donated $10 million to the University for biological research at his death in 1971. The land was donated by the state in the 1930s, and a stadium was constructed. Rutgers, along with many of the older American institutions (including Princeton and Yale) became co-educational in the 1960s and 1970s. On September 10, 1970, after several years of debate and planning, the Board of Governors voted to admit women into the previously all-male Rutgers College. In 2002, former Governor James E. McGreevey appointed a committee chaired by P. Roy Vagelos to explore the possibility of merging Rutgers University with the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). Since the 1950s, Rutgers has continued to expand, especially in the area of graduate education.

The closest living relative is the genus Zerene, which is sometimes included in Colias. This genus occurs throughout the Holarctic, including the arctic regions. Most if not all species of this genus, as usual for Coliadinae, do not sequester toxins or other noxious compounds from their food plants.

Schizaea is a small genus of specialized ferns in the family Schizaeaceae. Common names include curlygrass fern and comb fern. Some species are very small and inconspicuous, and so may often be overlooked in nature. The genus is distinctive and not at all like the common conception of a fern, though it is still considered a true fern (leptosporangiate). The sterile fronds (trophophylls) are grass-like, and the spore-bearing fertile frond (sporophyll) is similar, but with a small, pinnate fertile segment at its apex. Various of the roughly two dozen species have been reported from widely separated regions, including much of the tropical Old and New World, parts of the Eastern USA, Chile, the Falkland Islands, and various Pacific islands, including several islands of New Caledonia, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Many ferns of this genus have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of evergreen fronds 30 to 200 cm long. The sori are round, with a circular indusium, except in South American species which lack an indusium. The genus differs from the well-known and allied fern genus Dryopteris in the indusium being circular, not reniform, and in having the leaf segments with auricles—asymmetrical blades where one side of the segment is much longer than the other at the base. They are called leaf insects because their large, leathery forewings have veins that look similar to the veins on the particular type of leaves they inhabit.

The sori are round, with a circular indusium, except in South American species which lack an indusium. The genus differs from the well-known and allied fern genus Dryopteris in the indusium being circular, not reniform, and in having the leaf segments with auricles—asymmetrical blades where one side of the segment is much longer than the other at the base. They are called leaf insects because their large, leathery forewings have veins that look similar to the veins on the particular type of leaves they inhabit. Its scientific name bioculatum means \"two-eyed\" and refers to the two dots located on the abdomen just in this species.\n\n"

The move was made under unfortunate circumstances – as it turned out that Davis had leukemia, and died without ever playing a down in professional football. He played college football at Pennsylvania State University from 1957 to 1959 and professionally in the American Football League (AFL) with the Buffalo Bills from 1960 to 1961 and the Denver Broncos in 1962. Nicknamed \"Riverboat Richie\" due to his gambling instincts when calling plays, Lucas won the Maxwell Award and was runner-up to LSU's Billy Cannon for the Heisman Trophy in 1959. Lucas was a first round pick in both the 1960 NFL draft and the 1960 American Football League draft. He was obtained by the AFL's Denver Broncos following the 1962 equalization draft, but never played for the Broncos. Ernest Davis (December 14, 1939 – May 18, 1963) was an American football player, a halfback who won the Heisman Trophy in 1961 and was its first African-American recipient. Davis played college football for Syracuse University and was the first pick in the 1962 NFL Draft, where he was selected by the Washington Redskins. Davis was diagnosed with leukemia that same year, and died shortly after at age 23 without ever playing in a professional game. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979 and was the subject of the 2008 film The Express: The Ernie Davis Story.\n\n"

Starring Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, and Douglas Booth, the film is centered on Jupiter Jones (Kunis), an ordinary cleaning woman, and Caine Wise (Tatum), an interplanetary warrior who informs Jones that her destiny extends beyond Earth. The film was produced by Grant Hill and the Wachowskis, making Jupiter Ascending Hill's seventh collaboration with the Wachowskis as producer or executive producer. Whitlatch also designed detailed skeletons for the major characters and facial muscles on Jar Jar Binks as a reference for ILM's animators. The film made extensive use of the new technique of digital pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create \n\n Industrial Light and Magic, Weta Digital and Rodeo FX provided the effects for the film with Scott Stokdyk as the main supervisor. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible.\" Several of the film's effects rely heavily on practical stunts instead of CGI. They created a rig of six cameras, called the Panocam, which was mounted on a helicopter and covered nearly 180 degrees of the action. The technique piqued the interest of other directors who have subsequently used it in their own movies. Visual effects vendor Framestore used Vicon T40 cameras for pre-vis and motion capture purposes, the same camera system they used in the 2013 film Gravity, which was critically acclaimed for its cinematography and visual effects. When the boys are hovering over the drive-in, the film that is playing stars a space hero named Starkiller, named after George Lucas' original last name for Luke Skywalker, and the sound effects from the movie are from the Atari video game Yar's \n\n control the movements of thick sections of fur. Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio. In order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\".\n\n"

Arsenal won their first women's National League title, two points ahead of the previous champions of 1991–92, Doncaster Belles. The 2–1 win for Arsenal against Doncaster in March at Highbury was instrumental in securing the championship, reportedly only the second defeat of Doncaster Belles in a league game in 15 years. The game (part of an Arsenal fundraising day for Michael Watson) had 18,196 fans, the Women's National League/Premier League attendance record. Arsenal also completed a Treble by defeating Doncaster Belles in the 1992–93 WFA Cup Final and then beating Knowsley United in the 1992–93 League Cup Final.

She also headed the winner in the inaugural Premier League Cup final in May 1992, as Arsenal beat Millwall Lionesses 1–0. Ball scored in every round of the WFA Cup, and her headed goal in the 3–0 final win over Doncaster Belles was the 38th of a prolific campaign. In April 1995, Ball, by then reduced to bit-part status, came on for the final two minutes of Arsenal's 3–2 FA Women's Cup final win over Liverpool Ladies. In 1995–1996 Ball played for Wembley Ladies – and won a last minute penalty kick as Wembley ultimately beat Doncaster Belles in the Premier League Cup final on 10 March 1996. Ball featured for Wembley in the following season's 1–0 FA Women's Cup final defeat to Millwall Lionesses.\n\n"

In 2018, it was hosted with a fixed lineup hosted by Michael Strahan, with analyst Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and insider Jay Glazer. In 2019, Strahan remained host, but with Bradshaw and Long rotating as analyst, alongside analyst Tony Gonzalez, and insider Peter Schrager, serving as insider. Fox also signed Rob Gronkowski to make appearances on the program. To accommodate Strahan's commitments to ABC's morning show Good Morning America, the program was broadcast from New York City rather than Fox Sports' Los Angeles studios. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the pre-game show was moved to Los Angeles with Curt Menefee serving as main host, but with Strahan and Glazer making remote appearances. During the Divisional Playoffs, Menefee once again substituted for Joe Buck as host, as the pregame show again originated from Hollywood for both games. After Buck joined Aikman for play-by-play duties, Menefee took over as host for the remainder of the game and hosted the halftime and postgame shows. For sponsorship purposes, the show's full name is Fox NFL Sunday Presented by Ford Trucks, which also promotes Ford's F-Series lineup as \"the official pickup truck of the NFL”\n\n"

Tetsu Yamauchi was brought in to replace Fraser, while John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick became the band's keyboard player to compensate for the increasingly unreliable Kossoff (singer Paul Rodgers played keyboards on the previous album 1972 Free at Last). Both Yamauchi and Bundrick had played with Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke on the album Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu & Rabbit during that period in late 1971 when Free had broken up for the first time. Also, several other musicians were used on the album. the band finally gave up. The experimentation is also of note, as it follows the familiar pattern of excess that so frequently comes with most double albums in the rock and roll genre, most notably Fleetwood Mac's \"Tusk\", although nowhere nearly as wild or juxtaposed as Lindsay Buckingham's studio work on said album. In 1972, he contributed to the album Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit with Free guitarist Paul Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke, together with keyboard player John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick. He subsequently joined Free to participate in their final 1973 studio album Heartbreaker, replacing Andy Fraser.\n\n"

The band was founded by members Farshad Edalat (lead vocalist, percussion, songwriter) known by his stage name Shadi, Zachary Forbes (DJ, producer, songwriter) known by his stage name Waspy, and Anthony Dolhai (mixer, producer, songwriter) known by his stage name Tonez. The band have released three full-length studio albums (\"Debut\", \"Cassette\" and \"Pleasures\" ), one EP (LiCK 1.0), and a number of singles including \"Numbers\", \"True Love\", and \"My Life\". They have also toured and shared the stage with acts such as Dragonette, Funk Hunters, Miami Horror, k-os and Lights. Dirty Sweet is the debut extended play by Australian rock band, Jet, which first appeared in November 2002 on Rubber Records. The line-up of Jet were Chris Cester on drums, percussion, guitar and backing vocals; his brother, Nic Cester on vocals, rhythm guitar, piano and tambourine; Cameron Muncey on lead guitar and backing vocals; and Mark Wilson on bass guitar, keyboards, harmonica, and backing vocals. Two tracks, \"Take It or Leave It\" and \"Cold Hard Bitch\" were recorded in July 2002 with Lindsay Gravina, and two more tracks, \"Move On\" and \"Rollover DJ\", in the following month with Craig Harnath. The band was formed in 2002 when Richie James Follin (guitar and lead vocals) and Jessica Reynoza (bass and vocals) were both 18 years old and attending the same college. The trio's recording debut was the 7-inch single \"Burn\", released in 1988 on Skip Groff's Y&T Records. As a result, the band worked with producer John A. Rivers, who produced for various British guitar pop bands such as Close Lobsters and the Pastels, on its debut album. The current band line up consists of José Reis Fontão (lead vocals and guitar), Emmanuel Barichasse (lead guitar), Arno Bordas (bass guitar) and François Ernie (drums and backing vocals). In 2008, the group signed to Shimon's label, AudioPorn Records. They released their first single that year, the aptly named \"French F**k\" which quickly rose to the number one spot on Beatport's charts and stayed there for several weeks. Follow-up singles \"Quarks\" and \"Vandals\" proved the act's ascension was no fluke, showcasing the group's signature style-shifting low-end heavy sound. In 2013, Thomas quit the band to become a painter as \"Matheo de Bruvisso\". Firespawn is a Swedish death metal band from Stockholm, formed in 2012 by Alex Impaler of Necrophobic, Lars-Göran Petrov and Victor Brandt, both of Entombed A.D. The later addition of guitarist Fredrik Folkare of Unleashed and Necrophobic and drummer Matte Modin of Defleshed, completed the band's line-up. Nobleman's backing band on the album includes such names as singer-songwriter Geva Alon on guitar and vocals (sings co-lead vocals on \"Wonderful\"), Useless ID frontman Yotam Ben-Horin on bass and vocals, and Rockfour drummer Issar Tennenbaum on drums and percussion. Idlewild are a Scottish rock band formed in Edinburgh in 1995. The band's line-up consists of Roddy Woomble (lead vocals), Rod Jones (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Newton (drums), Andrew Mitchell (bass), and Luciano Rossi (keyboards). Initially, Idlewild's sound was faster and more dissonant than many of their 1990s indie rock contemporaries. However, it developed over time from an edgy and angular sound (as heard in their early material—once described by the NME as \"the sound of a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs\" ) to a sweeping, melodic rock sound as displayed on The Remote Part and Warnings/Promises.\n\nQuestion: Which band is from England, Fireflight or Dirty Pretty Things?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Rob Nelson of Variety, said in his review that \"A well-shaped and powerful reminder of a time in recent American history when white supremacy was decisively and courageously undercut.\" Duane Byrge in his review for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film by saying that \"veteran filmmaker Stanley Nelson has crafted a searing portrait of those violent, racist times. Intelligently composed and powerfully driven, Freedom Summer is a stirring historical document. Profiling the disco genre of music and the club culture surrounding it, the film is structured around academic Alice Echols's thesis that the genre played an important role in spurring advances in gender, racial and LGBTQ equality in the late 1970s and 1980s. The New York Times said \"It's so clever that it makes fun of itself with a mock connecting narrative.\" \"If I was a rapist or a murderer, they'd let me out,\" DeFriest says in the film. While it tells the story of bands that truly lived the indie/punk lifestyle, it also sheds a brand new light (not always favorable) on the people in those bands. Hardcore punk (usually referred to simply as hardcore) is a punk rock music genre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. The origin of the term \"hardcore punk\" is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, Hardcore '81. Hardcore historian Steven Blush said that the term \"hardcore\" is also a reference to the sense of being \"fed up\" with the existing punk and new wave music. Blush also states that the term refers to \"an extreme: the absolute most Punk.\" Canada has several Christian hardcore groups, including Grace like Winter and Means. Canada also has straight edge groups, such as Chokehold and an all-female band, Pantychrist. Along with Embrace, and Beefeater, they were one of the mainstay acts of the 1985 Revolution Summer movement which took place within the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene. Musically, Rites of Spring increased the frenetic violence and visceral passion of hardcore punk while simultaneously experimenting with its compositional rules. Lyrically, they also shifted hardcore into intensely personal realms and, in doing so, are often considered the first emo band, but Rites of Spring itself rejected any association between themselves and emo genres.

        "context": " Freedom Summer received positive reviews from critics. Rob Nelson of Variety, said in his review that \"A well-shaped and powerful reminder of a time in recent American history when white supremacy was decisively and courageously undercut.\" Duane Byrge in his review for The Hollywood Reporter praised the film by saying that \"veteran filmmaker Stanley Nelson has crafted a searing portrait of those violent, racist times. Intelligently composed and powerfully driven, Freedom Summer is a stirring historical document. Profiling the disco genre of music and the club culture surrounding it, the film is structured around academic Alice Echols's thesis that the genre played an important role in spurring advances in gender, racial and LGBTQ equality in the late 1970s and 1980s. The New York Times said \"It's so clever that it makes fun of itself with a mock connecting narrative.\" \"If I was a rapist or a murderer, they'd let me out,\" DeFriest says in the film. While it tells the story of bands that truly lived the indie/punk lifestyle, it also sheds a brand new light (not always favorable) on the people in those bands. Hardcore punk (usually referred to simply as hardcore) is a punk rock music genre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. The origin of the term \"hardcore punk\" is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, Hardcore '81. Hardcore historian Steven Blush said that the term \"hardcore\" is also a reference to the sense of being \"fed up\" with the existing punk and new wave music. Blush also states that the term refers to \"an extreme: the absolute most Punk.\" Canada has several Christian hardcore groups, including Grace like Winter and Means. Canada also has straight edge groups, such as Chokehold and an all-female band, Pantychrist. Along with Embrace, and Beefeater, they were one of the mainstay acts of the 1985 Revolution Summer movement which took place within the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene. Musically, Rites of Spring increased the frenetic violence and visceral passion of hardcore punk while simultaneously experimenting with its compositional rules. Lyrically, they also shifted hardcore into intensely personal realms and, in doing so, are often considered the first emo band, but Rites of Spring itself rejected any association between themselves and emo genres. This documentary film addresses the growth and the social, cultural and political aspects that influenced the hardcore punk music scene in Washington, DC.

In October 2015, the MGM Resorts branding was dropped and the site was renamed to simply Las Vegas Festival Grounds. The renaming was part of an effort to downplay MGM's role in the venue to improve its marketability for third-party events and to brand the site as being part of Las Vegas's \"community\". MGM sold the property to Phil Ruffin, along with the neighboring Circus Circus hotel and casino, in 2019. In April 2016, the Las Vegas Festival Grounds hosted the ACM Party For a Cause Festival on the weekend preceding the Academy of Country Music Awards. The festival was organized by Goldenvoice, known for organizing the Coachella Festival. Due to construction of expansions to the Circus Circus property, the 2020 Conexpo-Con/Agg moved its heavy equipment exhibition from the property's \"gold lot\" to the Festival Grounds. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds is an open-air venue on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Phil Ruffin. The venue is located at the north end of the Strip, north of Circus Circus Las Vegas. In 2007, MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) purchased the 26 acre El Rancho site from Gordon Gaming for $444 million. In 2014, MGM announced plans to develop the site as an outdoor music venue in partnership with Cirque du Soleil and Ron Burkle's Yucaipa Companies. The name was soon changed to the MGM Resorts Festival Grounds. It was owned by the MGM/Yucaipa/Cirque consortium, who collectively spent $20 million on its development. Rock in Rio organizers collaborated with MGM and Yucaipa on the design of the venue to ensure a \"very premium festival experience\", stating that it would have an amusement park-inspired layout with five stages (including dedicated stages for indie and electronic music acts), rides (such as a roulette-themed ferris wheel and a zipline), shopping, and themed food courts. From 2011 to 2015, the festival was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. For example, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival earned $114.6 million in 2017. Las Vegas Village, a 15 acre lot used for outdoor performances, was located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast. From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The festival's promoters were Live Nation Entertainment and MGM Resorts International. No festival has been held since 2017, following a deadly mass shooting in which a gunman shot and killed 60 people and injured hundreds more from a window on the 32nd floor of the adjacent Mandalay Bay hotel.

In October 2015, the MGM Resorts branding was dropped and the site was renamed to simply Las Vegas Festival Grounds. The renaming was part of an effort to downplay MGM's role in the venue to improve its marketability for third-party events and to brand the site as being part of Las Vegas's \"community\". MGM sold the property to Phil Ruffin, along with the neighboring Circus Circus hotel and casino, in 2019. In April 2016, the Las Vegas Festival Grounds hosted the ACM Party For a Cause Festival on the weekend preceding the Academy of Country Music Awards. The festival was organized by Goldenvoice, known for organizing the Coachella Festival. Due to construction of expansions to the Circus Circus property, the 2020 Conexpo-Con/Agg moved its heavy equipment exhibition from the property's \"gold lot\" to the Festival Grounds. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds is an open-air venue on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Phil Ruffin. The venue is located at the north end of the Strip, north of Circus Circus Las Vegas. In 2007, MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) purchased the 26 acre El Rancho site from Gordon Gaming for $444 million. In 2014, MGM announced plans to develop the site as an outdoor music venue in partnership with Cirque du Soleil and Ron Burkle's Yucaipa Companies. The name was soon changed to the MGM Resorts Festival Grounds. It was owned by the MGM/Yucaipa/Cirque consortium, who collectively spent $20 million on its development. Rock in Rio organizers collaborated with MGM and Yucaipa on the design of the venue to ensure a \"very premium festival experience\", stating that it would have an amusement park-inspired layout with five stages (including dedicated stages for indie and electronic music acts), rides (such as a roulette-themed ferris wheel and a zipline), shopping, and themed food courts. From 2011 to 2015, the festival was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. For example, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival earned $114.6 million in 2017. Las Vegas Village, a 15 acre lot used for outdoor performances, was located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast. From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The festival's promoters were Live Nation Entertainment and MGM Resorts International. No festival has been held since 2017, following a deadly mass shooting in which a gunman shot and killed 60 people and injured hundreds more from a window on the 32nd floor of the adjacent Mandalay Bay hotel.

Rick and Morty has won several awards since it debuted as a series, including a Critics' Choice Television Award, two Annie Awards, an American Cinema Editors Award, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. The Community episode \"Critical Film Studies\" (2011) was an homage to this film on which Harmon previously worked. Kevin Perry of The Independent believed that the title is a misdirect as it leads the audience to expect the episode to focus more on conversation between Rick and Mr. Nimbus, rather than Morty's wine expedition. Joe Matar of Den of Geek said that the episode mirrored the season four premiere \"Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat\" in not following a cliffhanger from the previous season and featuring a storyline about temporality, Jessica and the outcome of romantic failure for Morty. Harmon said that Rick's backstory would be further explored in the future. Morty is irritated at having to follow Rick's instructions, demonstrating his changing character from the more meek portrayal in season one. Rick and Morty is an American animated science-fiction comedy franchise whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a 2006 parody film of Back to the Future for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon.

Rick and Morty has won several awards since it debuted as a series, including a Critics' Choice Television Award, two Annie Awards, an American Cinema Editors Award, and two Primetime Emmy Awards. The Community episode \"Critical Film Studies\" (2011) was an homage to this film on which Harmon previously worked. Kevin Perry of The Independent believed that the title is a misdirect as it leads the audience to expect the episode to focus more on conversation between Rick and Mr. Nimbus, rather than Morty's wine expedition. Joe Matar of Den of Geek said that the episode mirrored the season four premiere \"Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat\" in not following a cliffhanger from the previous season and featuring a storyline about temporality, Jessica and the outcome of romantic failure for Morty. Harmon said that Rick's backstory would be further explored in the future. Morty is irritated at having to follow Rick's instructions, demonstrating his changing character from the more meek portrayal in season one. Rick and Morty is an American animated science-fiction comedy franchise whose eponymous duo consists of Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith. Rick and Morty were created by cartoonist Justin Roiland for a 2006 parody film of Back to the Future for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Dan Harmon. After six years, the sketch was developed into Rick and Morty, a half-hour prime time show that was a hit for Adult Swim, receiving universal acclaim across all seasons.\n\n"

The beverage is closely related to a traditional Romanian drink, called borș, a fermented wheat bran that can be used to make a sour soup called ciorbă or as the basis for Vegan cheeses.

A second batch can be made from the grain/pseudocereal, this time requiring only about one day to ferment.

Whether on store shelves, at farmers’ markets, or “cultured” at home, fermented foods are making a comeback that could be good for the American gut, the experts say. Adding fermented foods to the diet can boost immunity and decrease inflammation, with some studies suggesting they might improve conditions such as colitis, IBS, leaky gut, gastric reflux and high cholesterol. Fields and Hodkins advise starting with smaller portions – a couple of tablespoons to only a few ounces per day ̶ to reap healthful benefits. Live fermented foods can be consumed daily, but megadosing could lead to stomach pain, cramping or diarrhea. Fermented foods are fine for most people seeking general health support, but those with gastritis, acid reflux, ulcers, and other gastric issues and serious medical conditions should consult their doctor.

Traditional kefir is cultured with “kefir grains,” a culture of lumpy clumps of beneficial bacteria and yeasts that technically aren’t a “grain.” ​Dairy kefir is a good source of calcium and protein and is traditionally made from cow’s or goat’s milk, but now almond and soy milk varieties are available.

Fruity Water Kefir: You can add various fruits, such as berries or citrus, to water kefir during the fermentation process to create a fruity and refreshing probiotic beverage. By using yogurt culture and milk, you can make your own homemade yogurt with live and active cultures. Homemade Almond Milk: While not a fermented beverage itself, you can use homemade almond milk as a base for smoothies or as an ingredient in other probiotic-rich recipes.

Glutinous rice is soaked and drained, steamed for 1 hour, and then cooled down. Following 3 days of conversion from rice starch to sugar, a yeast culture is added and alcoholic fermentation begins. Äyrän (ayran) is a dairy drink made by diluting qatıq (katyk, sour milk) with cold water. Another non-alcoholic sweet beverage is şirbät (sherbet) made from honey. They drink hot, strong tea, usually with milk. Rejuvelac is a kind of grain water that was invented and promoted by Ann Wigmore, born in Cropos, Lithuania. The beverage is closely related to a traditional Romanian drink, called borș, a fermented wheat bran that can be used to make a sour soup called ciorbă or as the basis for Vegan cheeses. Rejuvelac is a raw food made by soaking a grain or pseudocereal (usually sprouted) in water for about two days at room temperature and then reserving the liquid. A second batch can be made from the grain/pseudocereal, this time requiring only about one day to ferment. Their tangy taste and revival of an ancient food practice are undoubtedly part of the allure of today’s fermented-foods trend, but their touted health benefits also are making foods such as kombucha, kefir and kimchi attractive to the masses. Whether on store shelves, at farmers’ markets, or “cultured” at home, fermented foods are making a comeback that could be good for the American gut, the experts say. Adding fermented foods to the diet can boost immunity and decrease inflammation, with some studies suggesting they might improve conditions such as colitis, IBS, leaky gut, gastric reflux and high cholesterol. Fields and Hodkins advise starting with smaller portions – a couple of tablespoons to only a few ounces per day ̶ to reap healthful benefits. Live fermented foods can be consumed daily, but megadosing could lead to stomach pain, cramping or diarrhea. Fermented foods are fine for most people seeking general health support, but those with gastritis, acid reflux, ulcers, and other gastric issues and serious medical conditions should consult their doctor. Skyr (pronounced “skeer”), an Icelandic-style yogurt that’s thicker, more protein-rich and lower in fat and sugar, is also hitting the U.S. food scene. Kefir (pronounced “kee’- fur,​” “kuh-feer’,” or “keh’-fur”), a tangy dairy beverage, is most-commonly known as a “drinkable yogurt.” It originates from the Caucasus Mountains in Eastern Europe and is considered a super power in probiotics, because it has more microflora than yogurt ̶ about 50 strains, including bacteria and yeast, says Hodkins. Traditional kefir is cultured with “kefir grains,” a culture of lumpy clumps of beneficial bacteria and yeasts that technically aren’t a “grain.” ​Dairy kefir is a good source of calcium and protein and is traditionally made from cow’s or goat’s milk, but now almond and soy milk varieties are available.

One of her most important translation was that of Richard Kirwan's Essay on Phlogiston \n\n During a physiology conference in 1667 a friend of Poullain de la Barre introduced him to Cartesianism, a philosophy created by philosopher René Descartes. Six years after his introduction to Cartesianism, Poullain de la Barre published a three part series on the female condition. In 1673 he published On the Equality of the Two Sexes: A Physical and Moral Discourse, Which Shows That it is \n\n In mechanics, Avicenna, in The Book of Healing, developed a theory of motion, in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and force of a projectile, and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination (mayl) transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that projectile motion in a vacuum would not cease. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no gases could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his Traité Élémentaire de Chimie: \"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.\" Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include Jean Rey (1583–1645), Joseph Black (1728–1799), and Henry Cavendish (1731–1810).\n\n"

Rock music has been highly dependent on technological developments, particularly the invention and refinement of the synthesizer, the development of the MIDI digital format and computer technology. In the late 1960s, rock musicians began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound; by the end of the decade the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock bands who would dominate rock in the early 1970s.\n\nQuestion: What genre of music was played by both Tappi Tíkarrass and INXS?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Jeff Beck also recorded two instrumental albums in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, the instrumental rock genre was dominated by several guitar soloists, including Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen and Steve Vai. The 2000s gave way to a new style of instrumental performer. Rock music has been highly dependent on technological developments, particularly the invention and refinement of the synthesizer, the development of the MIDI digital format and computer technology. In the late 1960s, rock musicians began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound; by the end of the decade the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock bands who would dominate rock in the early 1970s.\n\n"

Mineralocorticoids Glucocorticoids Formation Regulation Corticosteroids are a group of steroid hormones produced from the cortex of the adrenal gland, from which they are named. The adrenal gland produces aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, which is important in the regulation of salt (\"mineral\") balance and blood volume. Mineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and to a lesser extent the concentration of ACTH. ; Epithelial sodium channel blockers: amiloride and triamterene. Aldosterone is a hormone secreted by the cells of the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. Specifically, aldosterone stimulates the resorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the nephron. This leads to an increase in the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream, thereby promoting the retention of sodium by the body. Juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to low blood pressure or low blood sodium levels. As aldosterone levels increase, it leads to an increase in blood pressure, sodium concentration, and blood volume, thereby inhibiting the release of renin. It acts on the distal tubules of the nephron in the kidney, as well as other sites like the gastric mucosa, salivary glands, and sweat glands. Through its actions, aldosterone helps to maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as blood pressure regulation. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, has several effects on the kidneys. The main effects of aldosterone on the kidneys occur in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. In other words, it promotes the retention of sodium and the excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Additionally, aldosterone stimulates sodium retention in the distal colon and sweat glands through its receptors. The release of renin from the kidneys leads to the production of angiotensin II, which stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can also stimulate aldosterone secretion. Reference:\n- The adrenal cortex comprises three main zones, or layers that are regulated by distinct hormones. One internal stimulus that causes hormone release is blood pressure. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is a large driving force for the release of vasopressin, a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual's blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. It primarily acts on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidney. This hormone influences the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium, indirectly affecting water retention or loss, blood pressure, and blood volume. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, interferes with the aldosterone receptor and has a similar effect. Reference: Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium. Another example is spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic of the steroidal spirolactone group, which interferes with the aldosterone receptor (among others) leading to lower blood pressure by the mechanism described above. Biosynthesis The corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol within the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex. Most steroidogenic reactions are catalysed by enzymes of the corticosteroid synthesis pathway that are cytochrome P450 oxidases.
