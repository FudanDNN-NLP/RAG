On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" Caixin also reported that there were a number of people who died with COVID-19 symptoms but were not tested and were thus excluded from the official case-tally. Some patients died of other diseases due to a lack of proper treatment when \n\n British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government relating to the epidemic, raising concerns that the Beijing government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Asymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March. China CDC had to respond on the next day that the research was a retrospective analysis of the 425 cases reported to CDC on 23 January. Blood samples taken by the Chinese CDC from a random sampling of 34,000 Wuhan citizens one month after the virus first wave was contained showed 4.43% of people had antibodies which would equate to almost 500,000 infections. In the wider Hubei area 0.44% of those sampled were positive for antibodies, while of 12,000 nationally representative samples taken only two recorded positive results. inputted into the app, researchers estimated that when cases peaked on 1 April 2020, 2.1 million people in the UK aged between 20 and 69 may have had COVID-19, and that as of 23 May 2020, 280,000 people in that age range currently had symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The study also estimates the risk level to health workers, compared with the general public. Using data from the app, researchers were able to identify six distinct types of COVID-19 and forecast which initial symptoms were more likely to lead to severe illnesses. The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. However, people transferred to \n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

For example, drugs often act through multiple mechanisms, and often work best by engaging targets partially. Instead of acting via blockade of the NMDA receptor, (2R,6R)-HNK increases activation of the AMPA receptor via a currently unknown/uncertain mechanism. The compound is now \n\n Arketamine appears to be more effective as a rapid-acting antidepressant than esketamine in preclinical research. In rodent studies, esketamine produced hyperlocomotion, prepulse inhibition deficits, and rewarding effects, while arketamine did not, in accordance with its lower potency as an NMDA receptor antagonist and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. A study conducted in mice found that ketamine's antidepressant activity is not caused by ketamine inhibiting NMDAR, but rather by sustained activation of a different glutamate receptor, the AMPA receptor, by a metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine; as \n\n MTC who had been previously treated with cabozantinib, vandetanib or both (types of chemotherapy), and participants with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who had not received prior treatment with cabozantinib or vandetanib. Out of 88 participants who had never undergone treatment with an approved drug, 73% experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 61% of them. Efficacy for rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive thyroid cancer was evaluated in participants 12 years of age and older. A drug under development that would be used as an adjunct to antipsychotics improved cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, according to data from a randomized, controlled Phase II trial. In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics. [Updated, 1:10 ET] Investors are going to have to wait awhile before they see Amicus Therapeutics submit its Fabry Disease drug to the FDA for approval. Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA. While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period. Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S. Amicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months. Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group\n\nPomaglumetad (LY-404,039) is an amino acid analog drug that acts as a highly selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor group II subtypes mGluR2 and mGluR3.

In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit.

The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Despite this, ITN declared that recently adopted relaxations of COVID-19 measures for vaccinated individuals represented \"discrimination\" against non-vaccinated citizens and called for their abolition. Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as \"tyranny\" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests. Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat, M.D. Working together with governors, mayors, tribal leaders, state and local health departments, the medical community and our private sector partners, we have been monitoring the spread of H1N1 and facilitating prevention and treatment, including implementing a vaccination program. CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons.

The product is being marketed in the EU as Libmeldy. More recently gene therapy has been attempted as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant. In 1990, four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva became the first patient to undergo successful gene therapy. Researchers collected samples of DeSilva's blood, isolated some of her white blood cells, and used a retrovirus to insert a healthy adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into them.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available. Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development. Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells. Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development. Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years. GenePeeks simulates the combination of genetic sequences of two people and predicts potential diseases and inherited disorders to find good recipient matches for sperm donors. By simulating the process of reproduction with the two DNA sequences, the company's software (called Matchright) forms a hypothetical child genome to determine the likelihood of the resulting child developing one of around 600 conditions.

As such, adolescents were more likely to initiate vaping through flavored e-cigarettes than unflavored ones, and a majority of youth who used an e-cigarette first tried a flavored e-cigarette. The goal of tobacco companies also drives the widespread use of flavored tobacco products. Likewise, multiple reviews of internal tobacco company documents have found that flavored cigarettes are deliberately introduced to appeal \n\n young people, with flavorings often being fine-tuned to best appeal to youth. Furthermore, flavored tobacco products are often advertised to children and adolescents. Flavored cigarettes have been advertised in magazines frequently read by kids, such as Sports Illustrated, Cosmopolitan, and Rolling Stone and on television programs watched by adolescents. A majority of adolescents and young adults are exposed to cigarillo advertising in magazines and storefronts and on social media. Flavored e-cigarettes have been marketed extensively to youth in retail stores and on television and social media: 78.2 percent of American youth (20.5 million people). A 2018 analysis of the 2014, 2015, and 2016 NYTS data by the CDC \n\n Flavored tobacco products—particularly flavored cigarettes (including menthol), cigarillos, hookah,  and electronic cigarettes  —are disproportionately preferred by adolescents and young adults. Because of the high availability of these popular flavors, flavored tobacco products are widely used for at least 80% of youth tobacco users. According to the CDC, 67% of high school students and 49% of middle school students who used tobacco products in the past 30 days reported using a flavored tobacco product during that time. The long-term toxicity is subject to the additives and contaminants in the e-liquid. Certain e-liquid flavorings contain diacetyl and acetyl propionyl which give a buttery taste. Diacetyl and acetyl propionyl are associated with bronchiolitis obliterans (\"popcorn lung\"), a serious lung disease. Trying menthols increases smoking initiation among youth and young adults, and menthols users face greater addiction and decreased success in quitting smoking. Likewise, studies associate youth hookah use with subsequent cigarette use, increased intensity of cigarette use, and decreased success in quitting. A 2016 study found 11- to 16-year-old English children exposed to e-cigarette advertisements highlighting flavored, in contrast to flavor-free e-cigarettes, \n\nVaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening.

However, while several animals can regenerate heart damage (e.g. the axolotl), mammalian cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) cannot proliferate (multiply) and heart damage causes scarring \n\n were reprogrammed directly into cardiomyocyte-like cells. In order to achieve more reliable results, structures composed of the cells need to be produced and then transplanted. The purpose of these studies was to determine if stem cells safely taken from an individual’s bone marrow could be transplanted back into the injured heart muscle of the individual and improve the heart’s ability to pump following a heart attack, as well as to determine the best time for transplanting the cells following a heart attack. Researchers at UT Southwestern and other institutions may have found a way to reverse the damage that patients sustain from heart attacks, traumatic brain injuries and other conditions. They accomplish this by converting a less desirable type of cell, such as a scar-forming cell, into a highly desirable one, such as a nerve cell, using a process known as direct reprogramming. Most recent efforts to convert one cell type into another have relied on stem cells — immature versions of adult cells. But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics. Many scientists say direct reprogramming is a promising new approach to regenerative medicine — a field dedicated to curing disease by helping the body repair and regrow its own tissues. In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss. Researchers hope to one day develop drugs that will enable patients’ bodies to repair their own damaged organs, much the way a salamander can regrow its own heart and a python can double the size of its liver. At UT Southwestern’s new Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, researchers are focused on cultivating heart and nerve cells. The center, led by biologist Eric Olson, opened in May with a $10 million gift from the Hamon Charitable Foundation. Olson hopes the center will help UT Southwestern attract top college graduates from around the U.S. Olson’s career-long interest in how a single cell develops into the trillions that make up the human body led to his lab’s current work. “I wanted to understand how specialized cells were formed and how large sets of genes turned on and off during development,” he said. After pondering what cell type to focus on, Olson settled on muscle cells, because muscles make up 40 percent of our body mass and turn on thousands of genes as they develop. It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process. In the center’s inaugural publication this month in the journal Science, Olson and his colleagues outlined a way to “edit” the gene abnormalities responsible for the disorder in a mouse and rectify\n\n fibrosis. However, serious doubts have been placed \n\nDespite what your mother told you, time cannot mend all broken hearts, but current research indicates that cord blood and cord tissue stem cells may be able to help heal the real thing. Because the cells of the heart do not replace themselves naturally, those who have suffered from heart disease may have few treatment options available. Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease. Stem cells may be used to help replace the damaged heart tissue and valves and establish new vessels to supply them with blood. Stem cells could also be used to build new heart tissue, even whole new hearts. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs. About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells. In 2001, scientists reported that after they injected stem cells into the damaged wall of the ventricle, these cells led to the formation of new cells, which in turn developed into coronary arteries, arterioles and capillaries. The researchers found that mice that received the transplanted cells survived in greater numbers than mice with heart attacks that did not receive the mouse stem cells. In 2003, sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville became the first human to receive experimental stem cell therapy to revive his damaged heart tissue. In lieu of heart transplant surgery, Bonnville’s parents opted for a stem cell therapy to repair his damaged heart.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Direct LDL particle measurement \n\n lesser extent their size, has a stronger and consistent correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), and to a lesser extent size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low. Pattern B and coronary heart disease is stronger than the correspondence between the LDL number measured in the standard lipid profile test. Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense (\"buoyant\") LDL. The problem with this approach is that LDL-C values are commonly discordant with both direct measurements of LDL particles and actual rates of atherosclerosis progression. Direct LDL measurements are also available and better reveal individual issues but are less often promoted or done due to slightly higher costs and being available from only a couple of laboratories in the United States. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a better way to calculate more precisely the level of so-called bad cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. “The traditional way of measuring LDL cholesterol too often underestimates it,” says Johns Hopkins cardiologist Steven Jones, M.D. There are several types, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which helps remove cholesterol from the arteries and prevent fatty buildup, and various non-HDL lipoproteins, which in excess are linked to artery damage, heart disease and stroke. These include intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Nearly one in four people found to have LDL cholesterol in the “desirable” level through the traditional calculation method actually may have needed more aggressive treatment, according to a study at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine published in 2013 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Also included is LDL cholesterol, which is normally estimated rather than directly measured. To calculate LDL, labs use a formula known as the Friedewald equation, a more expedient way to assess LDL compared with actually measuring it, (which involves a cumbersome and expensive process called ultracentrifugation). But Johns Hopkins researchers found that this often makes LDL cholesterol appear lower than it really is for some high-risk patients. Because it’s individualized and looks at all non-HDL cholesterol—not just LDL—it can be used to make more precise decisions about treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke. “LDL cholesterol alone is a relatively poor\n\n NMR was mentioned by the ADA and ACC, in a 28 March 2008 joint consensus statement, as having advantages for predicting individual risk of atherosclerosis disease events, but the statement noted that the test is less widely available, is more expensive [about $13.00 US (2015 without insurance coverage) from some labs which use the Vantera Analyzer ]. Accurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is important because it helps assess their risk of heart disease. LDL cholesterol, also known as \"bad\" cholesterol, builds up in artery walls and contributes to the formation of plaque, which can harden and narrow the arteries. However, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a more precise calculation method that provides a more individualized and accurate assessment of risks associated with LDL cholesterol. Regular screening and monitoring of LDL cholesterol levels can help guide treatment decisions and interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and medication therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Regular monitoring and management of LDL cholesterol levels are essential for maintaining heart health. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The center has also collaborated with Duke University researchers on dolphins' energy expenditures. The Natural Resources Defense Council an environmental advocacy group believes that oil and gas exploration is leading to overwhelming whale deaths in the Gulf of Guinea. Similar cases have happened in the Canary Islands and Hawaii. There is a belief that ocean noise presents a significant threat to marine mammals and other marine species. The head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare's whale programme, Patrick Ramage said collisions with ships, water pollution and seismic activity from oil drilling can kill or disorient whales. On June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, possibly under the influence of domoic acid, flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid. According to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute, \"It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing. Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human-related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts, or transport of algae species via ship ballast water.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Also, past injury compensation, and stress can result in complicated shoulder pain. Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the \"decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments.\" Patients and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training. ; Increased DOMS leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure pain or tendon swelling amongst patients. ; Older individuals are less vulnerable to injury from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the \n\n Those who have had this procedure done are expected to have a stronger ankle, meaning their ankle will no longer give out on them. It is estimated that most patients who have this procedure experience restored stability. Their ankles felt stable, and after they completely recovered, they noticed improved stability and significant restoration of function. Any pre-existing arthritis stage in upper or lower ankle joints will not be changed through this procedure and may act as a factor in decision making of pros and cons. Another study suggested that \"shneck pain\" was in the nearby supraspinatus muscle and this resulted from a seemingly asymptomatic form of shoulder impingement. While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. Surgery has traditionally been shown to have a lower risk of re-rupture, however, it has a higher rate of short term complications compared to non-surgical approaches. Additionally certain rehabilitation techniques (early weight-bearing in an orthosis and early range of movement exercises) appear to have shown similar rates of re-rupture compared to surgery. In centers that do not have early range of motion rehabilitation available, surgical repair is preferred to decrease re-rupture rates. Adolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City. Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in\n\nObjective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. But both surgical and non-surgical rehabilitation protocols have recently become quicker, shorter, more aggressive, and more successful. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. Patients with joint diseases, knee arthritis, and weight gain related joint problems can take advantage of high quality Orthopedic care services such as knee surgeries and treatment of bone fractures. Orthopedic surgeons treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including: fractures and dislocations, torn ligaments, sprains, and strains, tendon injuries, pulled muscles, and bursitis, ruptured disks, sciatica, low back pain, and scoliosis, knock knees, bow legs, bunions, and hammer toes, arthritis and osteoporosis, one tumors, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, club foot and unequal leg length, abnormalities of the fingers and toes and growth abnormalities. A small incision is made at the knee joint so the surgeon may insert the arthroscope, a long, narrow tube-like instrument with a viewing eyepiece on one end, into the joint. If considerable damage is available within all three joint sections, a total knee replacement most likely will be recommended; however, if only one requires intervention, a partial knee replacement may be considered. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon carves away the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal or plastic.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS, but discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is still rampant. But the greatest challenge for many people is still the stigma that accompanies the illness. The burden of AIDS is much higher among African-Americans. For these reasons, many prefer to risk infection rather than face the stigma of HIV/AIDS. Experts warn that \"addictphobia\" has contributed to discrimination against those who were infected with HIV through IV drug use. As a result, people who are HIV-positive, African-American, and use IV drugs often face three stigmas. Discrimination against people with HIV is often rooted in a lack of understanding about the virus and how it spreads. You can choose whom to tell about your HIV status.

The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years. for suicide. Studies have demonstrated that asking if a depressed friend or family member has thought of committing suicide is an effective way of identifying those at risk, and it does not \"plant\" the idea or increase an individual's risk for suicide in any way. An estimated 4.4 percent of the global population suffers from depression, according to a report released by the UN World Health Organization (WHO), which shows an 18 percent increase in the number of people living with depression between 2005 and 2015. Depression is a major mental-health cause of disease burden. Its consequences further lead to significant burden in public health, including a higher risk of dementia, premature mortality arising from physical disorders, and maternal \n\nThis program is designed for any level employee to learn how to better recognize suicidal behavior, provide appropriate referral, and institute helpful prevention strategies. Every 40 seconds someone in the world dies by suicide. Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative. The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). Anti-anxiety agents, sedatives, hypnotics, pain relievers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are the most frequent medications associated with suicide. One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. Taken in total, multiple medications are often present in attempted suicide and mortality. The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively. Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own. These students also believed that stress, a potential severe manifestation of suicidal ideation, was part of a normal college environment and not something to raise concern. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Additionally, suicidal individuals may not report needing care because they have a stigma associated with their symptoms. Research has shown that positive attitudes towards care, mental health literacy, peer training, family and friend support, prior service utilization, gatekeeper training, and screening for suicidal thoughts and\n\n Pakistan's suicide rate is below the worldwide average. The 2015 global rate was 6.1 per 100,000 people (in 2008, 11.6). Suicides represent some 0.9% of all deaths. In 2015, the suicide rate in Pakistan was approximately 1.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one seventh of the global average. Similarly, suicides represent only ~.1.2% of all deaths. There is a high stigma against mental illness. Suicide is a problem in Indonesia and in 2018 ranks 65 with 2.9 suicides per 100,000. Suicides are often unreported due to stigma, approximately 10,000 people commit suicide per year. This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment. A review of RCTs and epidemiological studies by Healy and Whitaker found an increase of suicidal acts by a factor of 2.4.

However, while individual studies have provided strong results on the effect size of fetal testosterone on aggressive or violent behavior, meta-analyses have remained less conclusive. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, which results in hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out the negative effects of social isolation on AHN. Researchers injected both orchidectomized (ORX) (castrated) and sham castrated male rats with BrdU to determine if the number of new cells was increased. They found that AHN in male rats is increased with mild exercise by boosting synthesis of dihydrotestosterone in the hippocampus. In preadolescent male rats, neonatal rats treated with flutamide developed more depression-like \n\n compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia. Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells. Moreover, estrogens had \n\n and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total).

There is a medical condition called late-onset hypogonadism; according to Thomas Perls and David J. Handelsman, writing in a 2015 editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, it appears that this condition is overdiagnosed and overtreated. females are underdiagnosed. Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. They include:\n\nJune 17 2017 by Ray Sahelian, M.D. Early detection and intervention significantly improve outcome, with about one third of persons with autism achieving some degree of independent living. Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. I don't know enough about autism and the biochemical abnormalities to know whether serotonin is found too much, too little, or serotonin levels in autism are affected only in certain areas of the brain and whether supplements would help.

It is possible to interfere with the body's production of testosterone using medications that disrupt the process. Luteinizing hormone signals specialized cells in the testicles (Leydig cells) to secrete testosterone into the bloodstream; follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sperm production. The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The result is testosterone levels similar to those that occur after surgical castration or with estrogen. The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Cobb is recognized widely as a pioneer in the women's health movement in North America and has won critical recognition for her work in the field. In 1984 she founded the popular health newsletter, A Friend Indeed, dedicated to highlighting the increasing medicalization of menopause, and to breaking the taboo of silence that still hung over many important women's health issues, such as menstruation, menopause and breast cancer. She is also a contributor to Our Bodies, Ourselves, the groundbreaking women's health collective. She says her self-confidence was damaged during this time, and this, as well as back pain, contributed to her decision to get a breast reduction in her teens.

Furthermore, Somers has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and even a book of poetry, showcasing her diverse range of interests and talents. Throughout her career, Suzanne Somers has been a strong advocate for various health-related issues. However, her views on some medical subjects have faced criticism. She has faced scrutiny for her support of the Wiley Protocol, which is deemed \"scientifically unproven and dangerous.\" Additionally, her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has drawn criticism from the American Cancer Society. It is worth noting that while Somers has achieved success in her career, her ventures into health-related advocacy have been met with controversy.

As always, a key issue is how benefits and complications of such agents compare with statins—molecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s. ; Phytosterols are widely recognized as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy, although no scientifically proven beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) or overall mortality exists. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. ; Several \n\n inhibitors have been researched to improve HDL concentrations, but so far, despite dramatically increasing HDL-C, have not had a consistent track record in reducing atherosclerosis disease events. Some have increased mortality rates compared with placebo. ; Clofibrate is effective at lowering cholesterol levels, but has been associated with significantly increased cancer and stroke mortality, despite lowered cholesterol levels. fenofibric acid have had a better track record and are primarily promoted for lowering VLDL particles (triglycerides), not LDL particles, yet can help some in combination with other strategies. ; Some Tocotrienols, especially delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, are being promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having been shown in vitro to have an effect. Adding an experimental new biologic drug to conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs may result in better cholesterol control and reduced risks of heart attack and stroke, according to a new study. The findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's maker, Amgen. The patients were offered an opportunity to join a one-year extension trial. The researchers randomly assigned patients to either standard treatment -- usually with cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins -- or to standard treatment as well as the new drug. The new drug works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL -- or so-called ''bad'' -- cholesterol from the blood, the researchers explained. \"This is a new class of drugs. \"Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. The drugs, known as PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, \"have demonstrated impressive reductions in LDL levels,'' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. As of about 2005, these guidelines were: Over time, with more clinical research, these recommended levels keep being reduced because LDL reduction, including to abnormally low levels, was the most effective strategy for reducing cardiovascular death rates in one large double blind, randomized clinical trial of men with hypercholesterolemia; far more effective than coronary angioplasty/stenting or bypass surgery. Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note to clients that Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, has a different method of reducing \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. A year and a half after its feted approval, a new cholesterol drug has passed a key test. Those benefits are clinically significant, not just statistically significant, and in a conference call hosted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc.'s senior biotech analyst Salim Syed, James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Medical School and president-elect of the national lipid association, stressed the good news about the results. \"There are an very bad lot of people with really quite high cholesterol out there and we'll probably need more than one drug to get their levels down\". \"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine\". LDL particles carry many fat molecules (typically 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules per LDL particle); this includes cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and others. Thus even if the hundreds to thousands of cholesterol molecules within an average LDL particle were measured, this does not reflect the other fat molecules or even the number of LDL particles. From human clinical trials, it has become increasingly evident \n\nMarch 26, 2012 (Chicago) -- An experimental biologic drug called REGN727 may help lower levels of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol when a statin drug isn't enough, researchers report. In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%. In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo. \"It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future,\" he tells WebMD. The new drug works differently than statins do. This, in turn, clears LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Statin drugs work in a different way to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone. About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins. Both studies are too small and too short to draw any conclusions about the drugs' safety, Raymond Gibbons, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a past president of the American Heart Association, tells WebMD.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It causes moderate eye irritation. Visine is a brand of eye drops produced by Johnson & Johnson. Visine Original The active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels. Administration Visine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily . Adverse effects Those using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application. These drops are also not advised for contact lens wearers because decreased blood flow to the surface of the eye will further lower the levels of oxygen available to the eye. Visine is not to be used by patients with glaucoma since the production of more liquids only contributes to the problem of high pressure within the eye. Side effects A common urban legend is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause harmless but debilitating bouts of explosive diarrhea, akin to that of a laxative. This will not produce explosive diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride such as: Dangerously low body temperature (hypothermia) Blurred vision Nausea and vomiting (as opposed to explosive diarrhea) Difficulty in breathing or even a complete halt in breathing Elevating (hypertension) then dropping (hypotension) blood pressure Possible coma Seizures and tremors Death Anyone ingesting Visine should get medical attention or contact a poison control center immediately. Varieties Visine is formulated in several varieties: VISINE A.C. - Astringent/Redness Reliever Eye Drops (Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%, Zinc sulfate 0.25%) Special formula for allergens, such as ragweed, dust, or pollen. VISINE-A (Formerly OCUHIST) (Naphazoline/pheniramine) Antihistamine combined with a vasoconstrictor for itchy eyes associated with allergy.

In February 2016, the FDA issued a \"black box\" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. In 2006–2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%), male sterilization (8.8%), intrauterine device (4.9%), withdrawal (4.6%). Depo-Provera is used by 2.9%, primarily younger women (7.5% of those 15-19 and about 4.5% \n\n Stating that contraception is a lie and \"against the beginning of new life\", the Philippine Medical Association also stressed that the \"health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer\". The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000.\" They state that providing over the counter contraceptives could increase overall contraceptive accessibility for young \n\nThe FDA has approved Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg, a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years. Indications: Kyleena is a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years. • Release rate of levonorgestrel (LNG) is 17.5 mcg/day after 24 days and declines to 7.4 mcg/day after 5 years; Kyleena must be removed or replaced after 5 years. • To be inserted by a trained healthcare provider using strict aseptic technique. • Patient should be re-examined and evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after insertion; then yearly or more often if clinically indicated. Safety and efficacy: The contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena. FDA approves Bayer’s Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg for prevention of pregnancy for up to five years. The combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring is self-administered once a month. They could theoretically affect implantation but no evidence shows that they do. Worn continuously for three weeks followed by a week off, each vaginal ring provides anywhere from one month (NuvaRing) to one year (Annovera and Progering) of birth control. For continuous-use contraception, users \n\n Contraception has many benefits beyond preventing pregnancy. In 2003, the FDA rejected Intrinsa, a 300 µg/day testosterone patch for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women. The reasons cited were limited efficacy (about one additional sexually satisfying event per month), concerns about safety and potential adverse effects with long-term therapy, and concerns about inappropriate off-label use.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Due to this injury, Hutton was appointed the starter with rookie Jonas Johansson as his backup. He finished the regular season with a 12–14–4 record in 31 appearances and a career-low goals-against average and save percentage. Boeser was injured in a game against the New York Islanders on March 5, 2018, when he collided with Cal Clutterbuck and the Canucks bench. It was later reported he suffered a back injury and would miss 4–6 weeks to recover. At the time of his injury, he led the team in goals, points, shots on goal, and power-play points. Boeser recovered from his injury enough to join the Canucks \n\n the Lightning reassigned four 2014 draft picks to their respective junior hockey clubs (Digiacinto, Point, Masin and Thomas). In the Blackhawks’ penultimate 2016–17 regular season game, Nick Ritchie of the Anaheim Ducks punched Rozsíval in the face as retaliation for a cross-check he delivered to Corey Perry. Rozsíval suffered a facial fracture that required surgical repairs. The NHL suspended Ritchie for two games (one regular season and one playoff game) on the basis that Ritchie's punch was unexpected and Rozsíval was not prepared to fight or defend himself. Rozsíval missed the Blackhawks 2016–17 finale and the entire 2017 playoffs due to the injury. He was later diagnosed with post-concussion symptoms and was placed on the Blackhawks long-term disabled list before the 2017–18 NHL season. In 64 games with the Amerks, Roy contributed with 10 points from a checking-line role. On July 10, 2013, he was re-signed by the Amerks to an additional one-year contract. After two seasons with Rochester, and with limited interest as a free agent, Roy opted to end his professional career intending to go back to school and further his education. Draft notes ; Winnipeg's second-round pick will go to Buffalo as the result of a trade on March 5, 2014 that sent Matt Moulson and Cody McCormick to Minnesota, in exchange for Torrey Mitchell, a second-round pick in 2016 and this pick. ; Minnesota's second-round pick will go to Buffalo as the result of trade on April 3, 2013 that sent Jason Pominville and a fourth-round pick in 2014 to Minnesota, in exchange for Matt Hackett, Johan Larsson, a first-round pick in 2013 and this pick. ; Buffalo's fourth-round pick will go to the Edmonton Oilers as the result of a trade on March 4, 2014 that sent Ilya Bryzgalov to \n\n fracture\" in his left foot, and that he would be sidelined for up to two months as he recovered. As his recovery process dragged on, however, with van Riemsdyk still requiring crutches and a walking boot over a month later, the Leafs shut him down for the season on February 25. Prior to his injury, he had been on track for a career-best season, with 14 goals and 29 points in the 40 games that he did play. Van Riemsdyk entered the 2016–17 season fully healed from his foot fracture, and eager to begin playing alongside rising stars like Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner. In his third game, against the Philadelphia Flyers, Catenacci was injured by a check from Radko Gudas. After spending a week on the injured reserve list, Catenacci was reassigned to Rochester on February 19. He finished the season playing in 11 games with Buffalo, scoring no points. During the 2016–17 season, Catenacci was dealt by the Sabres at the trade deadline to the New York Rangers in exchange for defenseman Mat Bodie on February 28, 2017. He has played in 84 career NHL games, \n\n This was the second and most recent playoff meeting between these two teams with Buffalo winning the only previous series.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Additionally, an increase in fetal microcephaly, as well as other \n\n Zika virus has been shown to have teratogenic effects, causing defects in fetal neurological development. Cerebral organoids have been used in studies in order to understand the process by which Zika virus affects the fetal brain and, in some cases, causes microcephaly. Cerebral organoids infected with the Zika virus have been found to be smaller in size than their uninfected counterparts, which is reflective of fetal microcephaly. Increased apoptosis was also found in cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus. The two methods by which NPC populations were reduced were increased cell death and reduced cell proliferation. The results found from studying cerebral organoids infected with Zika virus at different stages of maturation suggest that early exposure in developing fetuses can cause greater likelihood of Zika virus-associated neurological birth defects. In May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization, calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks \n\n​In late December the Brazilian government took the unusual and unprecedented step of warning Brazilian women of childbearing age not to get pregnant. Because health officials noticed an alarming spike in babies born with unusually small heads, a condition called microcephaly. ​When a new, devastating, and unexplained medical condition suddenly appears in large numbers like the microcephaly cases in Brazil, the first question any thinking person should ask is why? The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever. ​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika. It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely. If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. If that weren’t enough to give any thinking person pause about the risk to the unborn child of injecting aluminum into the mom, the safety of giving Tdap has never been tested on pregnant women. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in\n\nZika fever, also known as Zika virus disease or simply Zika, is an infectious disease caused by the Zika virus.

It is an impairment in recognition or assigning meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived and not associated with a generalized deficit in intelligence, memory, language or attention. Afflicted individuals can accurately distinguish the object, as demonstrated by the ability to draw a picture of it or categorize accurately, yet they are unable to identify the object, its features or its functions. Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI), also known as Cerebral Visual Impairment, is a form of neurological blindness that affects the way children interpret visual information. While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. Predominant factors correlated with CBS are a decrease of visual acuity, visual field loss, and elderly age. The most commonly accepted theory for Charles Bonnet Syndrome proposes that extreme visual impairment promotes sensory deafferentation, leading to disinhibition, thus resulting in sudden neural firings of the visual cortical regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging \n\nIf you've just learned that your child is visually impaired, you are probably trying to sort out how serious the problem is, where to get help, and what this means for your child's future. In many cases, visual impairments can be corrected. If your child's visual impairment is serious, give yourself time to adjust. One in 20 preschoolers and 1 in 4 school-age children have vision problems, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Glasses can usually improve it. If detected early, temporarily patching the normal eye may resolve the problem by forcing the brain to use the affected eye. Amblyopia, also know as \"lazy eye,\" occurs when vision in one eye is reduced. Cortical visual impairment (CVI). Not enough oxygen to the brain, brain injury, or infections such as encephalitis and meningitis can cause CVI. It can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment and blindness. If more severe, ROP can result in permanent vision impairment or blindness. Genetically transmitted visual impairments. Infantile cataracts (a cloudy lens) and congenital glaucoma (a disorder that damages the optic nerve) often run in families. They can cause vision impairment. This is particularly important if your child has risk factors or a family history of eye problems. Children need their vision checked at infancy, 6 months, between 3 and 3 1/2 years, and upon entering school, around the age of 5. Visually impaired children can have learning problems that range from mild to severe. Labels such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHA), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder are becoming so common place, that teachers themselves are expected to not only recognise children with these labels, but to also provide appropriate support for them within the classroom setting. But what if this new label could actually explain many of the difficulties a child is experiencing and may actually result in the removal of some of the other labels? This is potentially the case for children affected by aspects of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them. Although CVI has recently been recognised as the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world, the vast continuum of visual difficulties associated with this umbrella term means that many of our children are not being correctly diagnosed. At one end of the CVI continuum, there are children who are functionally blind and don’t appear to be able to “see” the world around them. Fortunately, these children are more likely to receive an overall diagnosis of CVI, as their visual issues are more obvious. Despite having normal or near normal visual acuity however, many children are greatly affected by what is commonly referred to as visual perceptual difficulties. Another important aspect of visual perceptual difficulties, is that these issues are made worse when the environment around a person with these difficulties is cluttered.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Infections which are in the deep tissues ( necrotizing cellulitis, fasciitis and myositis) often include Clostridium spp., S. pyogenes or polymicrobic combinations of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Gas in the tissues and putrid-like pus with a gray thin quality are often found in these infections, and they are frequently associated with a bacteremia and high mortality rate. The overall risk of death is about 50% in streptococcal disease, and 5% in staphylococcal disease. The condition is more common in the developing world. Are there different types of necrotizing fasciitis? How do health care professionals diagnose necrotizing fasciitis? Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious? What are complications of necrotizing fasciitis? What are some additional sources of information on necrotizing fasciitis? Different types of bacterial infection can cause necrotizing fasciitis. Treatment of an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria involves rapid antibiotic administration and/or surgical debridement of the wound areas as well as supportive measures such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system. Good hygiene and wound care can reduce the chance of developing the disease; necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious but it is possible to transmit infectious agents to other people (cross-contaminations of wounds, for example). The prognosis depends on how fast the infection is diagnosed and treated and the patient’s response to treatments; outcomes usually range from fair to poor with complications including tissue loss and or amputation of limbs. Occasionally, mycotic (fungal) species cause necrotizing fasciitis. Popular publications and the media term necrotizing fasciitis as a \"flesh eating\" or \"skin eating\" disease or infection. In addition, the organisms that typically cause necrotizing fasciitis are termed \"flesh-eating bacteria\" or \"flesh-eating parasites\" because of the rapid rate with which they can infect and kill human tissue. It is likely that the disease had been occurring for many centuries before it was first described in the 1800s. Currently, there are many names that have been used loosely to mean the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis: flesh-eating\n\nNecrotizing fasciitis, also known as hemolytic streptococcal gangrene, is a very rare infection that spreads deep into the body along tissue planes. It is characterized by infection with S.pyogenes, a gram-positive cocci bacteria. ; Noma is a gangrene of the face common in Africa and Asia, with 99% of cases occurring there, whereas the disease is practically non-existent in other continents. ; Fournier gangrene is a type of necrotizing fasciitis that usually affects the genitals and groin. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia. Diagnosis \n\nNecrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, is a bacterial infection that results in the death of parts of the body's soft tissue. Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group.

For example, scientists predict that global warming will decrease the abundance of phytoplankton (a keystone \n\n from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations. Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, \n\n In December 2019, the World Meteorological Organization released its annual climate report revealing that climate impacts are worsening. They found the global sea temperatures are rising as well as land temperatures worldwide. Global carbon emissions hit a record high in 2019, even though the rate of increase slowed somewhat, according to a report from Global Carbon Project. Current climate change differs from that in the past not only because its primary cause is human activities but also because its pace is faster. The current rate of warming on Earth is remainder reaches Earth’s surface, where it is absorbed and some is then emitted back at the atmosphere. 600 500 400 300 200 Time (before 2005), in thousands of years 2.8 3.2 3.6 4.0 4.4 4.8 5.2\n\nFIGURE 151e-1 Overview of the earth’s temperature and primary greenhouse gases over the last 600,000 years.Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases—CO2 (red), CH4 (blue), and nitrous oxide (N2O; green)—were derived from air trapped within Antarctic ice cores and from recent atmospheric measurements.Shaded areas indicate interglacial periods.Benthic δ18O marine records (dark gray) are a proxy for global ice-volume fluctuations and can be compared to the ice core data. In contrast, in regions prone to drought, warming tends to result in greater periods between rainfalls and in the risk of drought.For areas that have traditionally had more precipitation on average, warming tends to promote heavier precipitation events.For example, the 2010 heat wave in Russia, which was unprecedented in its severity, contributed to hundreds of forest fires that generated enough air pollution to kill an estimated 56,000 people and that burned 300,000 acres of crops, including roughly 25% of the nation’s wheat fields.

The overall rate of adverse events in people treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in people treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found people treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, \n\n In 2008, the U.S. FDA added black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones, advising of the increased risk of tendon damage. In 2016, the FDA found that systemic use (by mouth or injection) of fluoroquinolones was associated with \"disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects\" involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, concluding that these side effects generally outweigh the benefits for people with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections when other treatment options are available. On 12 May 2016, the FDA issued a drug safety communication advising that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for these conditions only when no other options are available due to potentially permanent, disabling side effects occurring together. The FDA put out another label change in July 2017, strengthening the warnings about potentially disabling adverse effects and limiting use of these drugs to second-line treatments for acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Quinolones are associated with a small risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture; a 2013 review found the incidence of tendon injury among those taking fluoroquinolones to be between 0.08 and 0.20%. The risk appears to be higher among people older than 60 and those also taking corticosteroids; the risk also may be higher among people who are male, have a pre-existing joint or tendon issue, have kidney disease, or are highly active. the labels to describe the potential for irreversible peripheral neuropathy (serious nerve damage). In November 2015, an FDA Advisory Committee discussed the risks and benefits of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs based on new safety information. The advisory committee concluded that the serious risks associated with the use of fluoroquinolones for these types of uncomplicated infections generally outweighed the benefits for patients with other treatment options. The 21-member joint \n\n such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Reports of serious adverse events began emerging, and the FDA first added a black-box warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. In August 2013, the agency required updates \n\n More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of \"black box\" warnings in the United States. A 2018 EU-wide review of fluoroquinolones concluded that they are associated with serious side effects including tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, \n\n the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the U.S. FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 U.S. FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee included musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. Meta-analyses conclude that fluoroquinolones pose little or no additional risk to children compared to other antibiotic classes. FACT CHECK: Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture. The antibiotics you took or are taking for your sinus infection, UTI, skin infection, laser eye surgery…ect [sic]…may have already damaged you. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" On 7September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\".

The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, \n\n Comstock supported a ban on abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. In 2011, Comstock voted in favor of HB 462, which required women to have transvaginal ultrasounds before receiving an abortion. When opponents pointed out that this would necessitate an internal ultrasound for early-term pregnancies, an amendment was passed to limit the requirement to external ultrasounds only. She supported making birth control available to women over the counter. jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development, or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion. Other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus' father before aborting the fetus, that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure—sometimes including \"risks\" not supported by the medical literature—and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary. China, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy. Many, but not all, \n\n In some U.S. states, informed consent laws (sometimes called \"right to know\" laws) require that a woman seeking an elective abortion receive information from the abortion provider about her legal rights, alternatives to abortion (such as adoption), available public and private assistance, and other information specified in the law, before the abortion is performed. Germany) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive. Current evidence indicates that diagnostic ultrasound is safe for the unborn child, unlike radiographs, which employ ionizing radiation. In one randomized trial, the children with greater exposure to ultrasound had a reduction in perinatal mortality, and was attributed to the increased detection of anomalies in the ultrasound group. The 1985 maximum power allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 180 milliwatts per square cm is well under the levels used in therapeutic ultrasound, but still higher than the 30-80 milliwatts per square cm range of the Statison V veterinary LIPUS device. Doppler ultrasonography examinations has a thermal index (TI) of about five times that of \n\n An additional factor is maternal health which was listed as the main reason by about a third of women in 3 of 27 countries and about 7% of women in a further 7 of these 27 countries. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among \n\n The virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection.

This virus is a strain of coronavirus that leads to the respiratory illness known as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is highly contagious in humans. It is considered the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. It is important to note that the virus has the potential to mutate, and some variants have shown increased infectivity. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and subsequently spread globally.

Johnson. Due to a number of medical complications, the device has not been approved in the European Union or the United States. The polypropylene, which is yarn-like, causes irritation to the implant pocket which causes the production of serum which fills the implant pocket on a continual basis. Problems can also \n\nThe European commission aims to strengthen oversight of companies that certify medical devices following a breast implant scandal thought to have affected at least 400,000 women worldwide. The low-grade breast implants produced by the now closed French manufacture Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were made available in nearly all member states with the largest concentration in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. The implants - containing silicone made for use in mattresses - were banned in 2010 but France caused waves in December last year when it issued a cancer alert and advised French women to have the implants removed. The report found that “data available today was insufficient to lead to firm conclusions regarding the health risks for women with PIP silicone breast implants”. The evidence of health risks for women with PIP silicon breast implants, it concluded, is weak. But proven fraud, possible sub-standard screening processes in Europe, and recent revelations that the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) banned the company in 2000 are causing concern among MEPs in the European parliament. PIP obtained a permit for its saline implants in 1997 from the German certification company, TUV Rheinland. The manufacturer declared a medical-grade silicone but instead used an industrial alternative that is around ten times less expensive saving the company around €1.2 million per year, according to Reuters. The FDA issued a warning letter to the company's founder, Jean-Claude Mas, and then banned PIP saline implants in the United States in 2000 after inspecting the manufacturer’s premises in southern France. The FDA agent who inspected the site in 2000 said the implants had been “adulterated”, according to press reports. The same plant in southern France was manufacturing the silicone implants generating the current uproar. \"The American\n\nDespite reassurance surrounding the controversial breast implants at the centre of a global health scare, fear is continuing to spread. Israel”s Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk. The decision was prompted by the French Government”s announcement that it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, to have them removed. Theyhave a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from arare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. Ithas also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coatingdesigned to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel. Up to now, there have been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the Middle East, and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in recent weeks. Shesaid ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from theNetherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Maltaand Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates. In response to concerns about breast implants and possible cancer risk, the Israeli Health Ministry has taken several measures. Furthermore, the Israeli Health Ministry has banned the use of Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP) implants in Israel. These implants, which have a higher than normal rupture rate and have been linked to cases of cancer, are no longer allowed for use in cosmetic procedures. Additionally, the French government has offered to cover the costs of removing the PIP implants for 30,000 women who have them. This action has further highlighted the concerns surrounding these implants and the potential risks they may pose. Overall, the Israeli Health Ministry has taken the issue seriously by implementing measures such as the hotline and the ban on PIP implants to address the concerns and ensure the safety of patients. as a part of the breast reconstruction process or used cosmetically to augment small breasts. An implant consists of a fluid-filled, malleable pouch that is designed to mimic to the look and feel of natural breast tissue when inserted into a pocket created under the skin in a procedure called a mammoplasty. The ensuing scare resulted in the largest product liability settlement in U.S. history and the Chapter-11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning Corporation, one of the makers of the implants. Despite legal settlements in the billions of dollars, the claims against silicone-filled implants remain anecdotal; numerous scientific studies have found no link or only a weak equivocal link between the implants and disease. The use of silicone-filled implants was again approved by the FDA for reconstructive surgery in 1998 and for cosmetic surgery in 2006. In 2010 silicone-filled implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned after it was discovered that the firm had used industrial-grade, instead of medical-grade, silicone gel. Some countries adopted similar recommendations, while others did not; the implants had not been licensed for use in the United States. A 2012 British report on the PIP implants found that the gel used in them did not constitute a long-term health threat. This study investigated whether breast implants are associated with abnormal ECG recordings. The boss of the French company which distributed the defective breast implants was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud.

Additionally, advertising from drug companies selling testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as dietary supplement companies selling all kinds of \"boosters\" for aging men, have emphasized the \"need\" of middle-aged or ageing men for testosterone. Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, \"sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales.\" that \"Evidence is lacking for many compounds believed to enhance athletic performance. I would be shocked if this stuff [meldonium] had an effect greater than caffeine or creatine (a natural substance that, when taken as a supplement, is thought to enhance muscle mass).\" Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful.

It is usually (but not always) associated with Haemophilus influenzae type b. Meningitis involves the inflammation of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Haemophilus meningitis is characterized by symptoms including fever, nausea, sensitivity to light, headaches, stiff neck, anorexia, and seizures. Five to ten percent of cases can be fatal, although the average mortality rate in developing nations is seventeen percent, mostly due to lack of access to vaccination as well as lack of access to medical care needed to combat the meningitis. from the disease. A child in the presence of family members sick with Haemophilus meningitis or carrying the bacteria is 585 times more likely to catch Haemophilus meningitis. Additionally, siblings of individuals with the Haemophilus influenzae meningitis receive reduced benefits from certain types of immunization. Similarly, children under two years of age have a greater risk of contracting the disease when attending day care, especially in their first month of attendance, due to the maintained contact with other children who might be asymptomatic carriers of the Hib bacteria.

In infants, symptoms may include fever, irritability, poor feeding, and a bulging fontanel (soft spot on the head). Meningococcemia, another manifestation of meningococcal disease, is a bloodstream infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis. In some cases, meningococcemia can cause blood clotting problems, leading to purpura fulminans, a condition characterized by extensive skin necrosis and organ damage. It is important to note that meningococcal disease can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, so prompt medical attention is crucial. If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms suggestive of meningococcal disease, it is important to seek immediate medical care. While best known as a cause of meningitis, it can also result in sepsis, which is an even more damaging and dangerous condition. Such observations have been seen to support the concept that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be capable of triggering a severe form of a Kawasaki-like disease. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, and Neisseria meningitidis is one of the leading pathogens responsible for this condition. It is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and bloodstream infections. Meningococcal infections can occur at any age, but children, particularly those aged 6 months to 2 years, are more susceptible to this infection. Consequently, environments like daycare centers and schools can facilitate the transmission of the infection. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the symptoms of a Neisseria meningitidis infection, which may include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Vaccination is also available to prevent some types of meningococcal infections, and it is recommended for infants, preteens, and certain high-risk groups. To conclude, Neisseria meningitidis is indeed a significant cause of meningitis, especially in children.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. In the United States a CDC survey based on data from 2013 to 2015 showed 54.4 million (22.7%) adults had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 23.7 million (43.5% of those with arthritis) had arthritis-attributable activity limitation (AAAL).

Researchers in Sweden found that so-called \"biologic\" drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or anti-TNFs, slightly reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome -- a condition that includes angina and heart attack in which blood supply to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. In another study, British scientists also found taking these drugs was associated with a lower risk for heart attack in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. The roughly 1.3 million Americans affected by the rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly begins to attack the joints, often suffer from pain, stiffness, swelling, and have trouble moving and using many of their joints. \"It has been known that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a greater risk of developing heart disease than those without,\" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. \"This risk seems to extend in many forms of cardiovascular disorders, among which the most notable is coronary artery disease, but also includes heart failure, peripheral artery disease and possibly stroke.\" In the first study, the Swedish team compared rates of heart disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking anti-TNFs with patients not using the drugs and people in the general population, to see if the medications could also cut the risk for heart issues. The study involved a group of more than 7,700 patients in Sweden with rheumatoid arthritis who had never been diagnosed with heart disease. The study revealed the prevalence of heart events was slightly lower among patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were actively taking anti-TNFs than people with\n\n Towards a Psychosis Risk Blood Diagnostic for Persons Experiencing High-Risk Symptoms: In this study, the researchers looked at different analytes found in human blood plasma.

Blood Tests to Diagnose Arthritis. Your doctor will use several different blood tests to help diagnose you with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions. Blood tests are usually fast. They take, or «draw,» blood into several test tubes. Once the rheumatoid factor level reaches a certain range, the patient tests positive for rheumatoid factor. Years ago, doctors used the positive result of rheumatoid factor in a patient’s blood to firmly diagnose them with rheumatoid arthritis. Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

I'm happy for the people that have used New Blood Test Predicts Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk. Such a test would substantially increase the early detection of RA and make treatment more effective. This test is done to assert the condition of the joints and not for any diagnosis. The development could allow those at high risk to take action such as adopting a healthier lifestyle and taking drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The more sensitive test identified proteins in the blood that signal heart cells have been dying in seemingly healthy people with no outward signs of heart disease. It was found that where the protein called troponin T were present, the patient was seven times more likely to die from heart disease within the next six years. Dr James de Lemos, associate professor of internal medicine at Southwestern Medical Centre, at University of Texas and lead author of the study said: “This test is among the most powerful predictors of death in the general population we’ve seen so far. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and follow on from an earlier study which suggested the protein could also predict heart failure, a condition where the organ fails to pump strongly enough causing breathlessness and fatigue. The more sensitive test can detect circulating protein levels in almost everyone with chronic heart failure and chronic coronary artery disease, the authors said. Currently doctors use computer software calculations called the Framingham Score and Qrisk to identify people at high risk of heart disease who could benefit from preventive treatments. The calculations take into account family history, smoking history, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and age. Until now, no blood test has been able to give an indication of a person’s risk of heart failure. People whose levels dropped over time appeared to reduce their risk of heart failure. Evidence of osteoarthritis and potentially inflammatory arthritis has been discovered in dinosaurs. The first known traces of human arthritis date back as far as 4500 BC. In early reports, arthritis was frequently referred to as the most common ailment of prehistoric peoples.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Officials in Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected Chinese-made equipment for being defective. The Spanish government said they bought thousands of test kits to combat the virus, but later revealed that almost 60,000 did not produce accurate results. The Chinese embassy in Spain said that the company that made the kits was unlicensed, and that these kits were separate from the ones donated by the Chinese government. The government of the United Kingdom paid two companies in China at least $20 million for test kits later found to be faulty. By March, China has been producing 100 million masks per day to meet the demand of medical staff and general public.

Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported \n\n the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients. WEDNESDAY, Sept. 7, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis may be able to keep the condition at bay with the immune-suppressing drug Humira (adalimumab), a new study finds. The current standard treatment for uveitis is corticosteroids. But this treatment comes with a significant risk of side effects, the researchers said. Humira reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation, Jaffe said. One concern with Humira is an increased chance of infections. For this phase 3 trial, Jaffe and colleagues randomly assigned more than 200 patients with uveitis to Humira or an inactive placebo. Among those taking Humira, the average time to a flare-up with the condition was 24 weeks, compared with 13 weeks for those taking the placebo, the investigators found. According to Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"Humira effectively achieved disease control after stopping steroid treatment.\" \"Further investigation into alternative therapies for uveitic disease is necessary to attempt to save the sight of the many patients that suffer from this sight-threatening group of diseases,\" Fromer said. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4–6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. During treatment with pyrimethamine, leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Prednisone may be used for 3–6 weeks to reduce macular or optic nerve inflammation and can be started on day 3 of antibiotic therapy. Corticosteroids should not be used without concurrent antibiotic treatment or in immunocompromised patients due to the risk of exacerbation of the disease. Currently, there is no published evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that corticosteroids would be an effective adjunct for treating ocular toxoplasmosis. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be equivalent to triple therapy in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis and may be better tolerated. The reference medicine for Hefiya is Humira. After training, patients or their carers may inject Hefiya if their doctor considers it appropriate. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases. The proportion of patients who had at least a 75% reduction in symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment was 68% with Hefiya and 63% with Humira. Because Hefiya is a biosimilar medicine, the studies on effectiveness and safety of adalimumab carried out with Humira do not all need to be repeated for Hefiya. What are the risks associated with Hefiya? A drug called Humira (adalimumab) has been found to effectively manage chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis without the significant risk of side effects associated with the current standard treatment of corticosteroids. Humira is an immune-suppressing drug that reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation. It has shown promising results in a phase 3 trial, where patients with uveitis who were treated with Humira experienced longer intervals between flare-ups compared to those who received an inactive placebo. However, it is important to note that Humira does carry an increased risk of infections, and patients need to be screened for tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis before taking the drug. It is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment option for managing chronic eye inflammation. Clearside Biomedical announced that their proprietary formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (CLS-TA) improved vision in patients with macular edema from noninfectious uveitis. pSivida announced in a press release that their injectable corticosteroid insert (Durasert) met its primary efficacy endpoint in a second phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of posterior uveitis. Clearside Biomedical is enrolling participants in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Santen is moving forward with a new drug application for sirolimus intravitreal injection (Opsiria) for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis, despite mixed results from their phase 3 trial, Sakura Study 2. A phase 3 trial shows the investigational drug sarilumab is superior to adalimumab (Humira) for treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. One-year data from a phase 3 trial for pSivida’s sustained-release corticosteroid implant (Medidur) shows it is highly effective in preventing recurrence of posterior uveitis. The FDA has approved the first non-corticosteroid therapy for non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) this week recommended that adalimumab (Humira) be approved for treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. Clearside Biomedical announced that a special formulation of triamcinolone acetonide showed good outcomes in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, helps prevent recurrence of posterior uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, may more effectively reduce recurrence and restore vision compared to standard therapy. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has signed a licensing agreement with EyeGate Pharmaceuticals for a potential alternative to eye drops and injections for anterior uveitis. For example, the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen (paracetamol) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014–2016 outbreak. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo—a city of 1 million residents with an international airport—or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. The Western African Ebola virus epidemic took more than 11,000 lives. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. On 6 January 2021, the Africa CDC reported that the total number of cases in Africa has reached 2,854,971 while the death toll has reached 67,986 and that 2,361,900 have recovered. On May 21, 2021, 55 member states of the African Union declared 4,732,150 cases, 127,612 deaths, and 4,238,275 recoveries. Following a visit to the DRC in July 2019, Rory Stewart, the UK's DfID minister, called for the WHO to declare it an emergency. Acknowledging a high risk of spread to the capital of North Kivu, Goma, a call for a PHEIC declaration was published on 10 July 2019 in the Washington Post by Daniel Lucey and Ron Klain (the former United States Ebola response coordinator). Their declaration \n\nThere are dozens of deadly diseases with the potential to become international health threats, including Ebola, avian influenza, and Zika. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which claimed more than 11,000 lives and took several billion dollars to contain, rallied international organizations and countries around the need to align efforts - among themselves and with the private sector - to prepare for future health emergencies. This list, which aims to cut the time needed to develop candidate products from years to months, is another outcome of the first Ebola wake-up call. Between its discovery in 1976 and the beginning of the epidemic in West Africa, the virus infected about 2,400 people and killed less than 1,600. \"Before 2013, Ebola outbreaks had been sporadic, and only affected a small number of people in isolated communities in poor African countries,\" Deputy Chief Executive Director of Gavi Anuradha Gupta told Devex. After confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC. The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the region, it did not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC. Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHEIC was that the \n\nMeanwhile, WHO has been given the go-ahead by officials in the DRC to import and use an experimental Ebola vaccine in the country, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \"The Senate is disturbed that recent reports by media outlets and the World Health Organisation show that the disease is back in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo with 19 dead and 39 infected recorded so far\". The Africa CDC will dispatch a team on Wednesday to the DRC to assess the situation and the level of support required to ongoing efforts by DRC and other partners to contain the outbreak, said John Nkengasong, Director of Africa CDC, during a press briefing on Tuesday at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. The last outbreak that was announced a year ago, was contained and declared over by July 2017. There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms. It was tested in Guinea in 2015. Bikoro Health Zone reported the highest number of cases (n=31), followed by Iboko (n=8) and Mbandaka (n=2) Health Zones. WHO is working with Congo's government and other global organizations, including Medecins Sans Frontieres, to strengthen coordination to fight and contain the Ebola outbreak. In October 2018 and then later in April 2019, the WHO did not consider the 2018–20 Kivu Ebola epidemic to be a PHEIC. The decision was controversial, with Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) responding with disappointment and describing the situation as \"an Ebola gas can sitting in DRC that's just waiting for a match to hit it\", while the WHO panel were unanimous in their decision that declaring it a PHEIC would not give any added benefit.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The paper, published in JAMA Cardiology, found that the rate of abortion for babies with major congenital heart disease (CHD) increased from 0.6% in 1996 to 39.1% in 2013 – a 65 fold increase. The rate is particularly high for some conditions – in the case of fetuses diagnosed with single ventricle defects (such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the most severe form of CHD), roughly 85% of pregnancies ended in abortion. Denmark began offering universal prenatal screening free of charge in 2004, and is already known to have a very high abortion rate for babies with Down’s syndrome. The last statement by Dr. Kon, that women who are not white may get more pressure to commit infanticide, is yet another evidence that indicates that eugenics never went away, but really is stronger today than it ever has been. Back in the first half of the 20th century, they were not pushing women to have abortions, but they were sterilizing people — which is still evil. Today, there is an entire international eugenics complex that is profiting from the advocation and committing of infanticide, and there is a specific targeting of minority children, or unborn children who are not white, to have them slaughtered through the consent of their own mothers, and by the hand of Social-Darwinist doctors. Last year, Planned Parenthood Southeast president, Staci Fox, admitted that the majority of the babies slaughtered in Planned Parenthood offices are minority babies. So Planned Parenthood specifically targets minorities to murder their children because it wants to eradicate their populations. There are numerous operatives who present themselves as “liberal” and as “against racism” while they lobby for Planned Parenthood. For example, Tim Wise, a Jewish American ‘anti-racist’ operative, will say many things against racism, but he will defend Planned Parenthood. Both of them claim to be against a fascist, totalitarian system — with one setting their crosshairs on racism and the other on Islamism –, and both claim to be for freedom, and to be against discrimination. But both back eugenics, while using their words against racism and Islam as a way to cover up their true motivations. While people like Ben Shapiro, Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and Robert Spencer all are part of the Counter-jihad crown, they both have pushed for policies that back the\n\n Gardner has said that he is pro-life and that abortion laws should be left up to the states. In 2006, Gardner opposed legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception and proposed an amendment to the Colorado state budget to prohibit the state Medicaid plan from purchasing Plan B emergency contraception. In 2007, he voted against a bill requiring hospitals to inform survivors of a sexual assault of the availability of emergency contraception. In 2012, Gardner co-sponsored the controversial so-called \"personhood\" legislation titled the Life Begins at Conception Act. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. According to The Denver Post, \"Gardner conceded that with \n\n M.A.C.

According to John Demsey, executive group president of the brand’s parent company Estée Lauder, “It is so important for people of all ages, all races and all genders to get the accurate information and care they need so they can live their best, healthiest lives, but we see that a lot of people aren’t seeking that information and care because of stigmas that disproportionately affect women, people of color and the LGBTQ community .”\n\n or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization\". The PMA condemns abortifacients that \"destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo\" and \"abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood\". On December 21, 2010, Bishop Thomas Olmsted of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix declared that a Catholic Healthcare West hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center, could no longer call itself a Catholic institution after a procedure was performed in 2009 to end a pregnancy to save a woman’s life. In a public statement, Bishop Olmsted called the procedure a direct abortion, which is in direct violation of The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. In a statement, St. Joseph’s President Linda Hunt said the hospital would comply with Olmsted’s decision, but she defended the actions of the hospital staff, stating, \"If we are presented with a situation in which a pregnancy threatens a woman’s life, \n\nLess than one percent of women getting a medication-induced abortion at Planned Parenthood had a serious side effect or a failed abortion, according to a new study. Researchers found the rate of abortion-related complications sending women to the emergency room or requiring a blood transfusion, for example, was one in 625 during 2009 and 2010. “At Planned Parenthood, medical abortion is extremely safe,” said reproductive health researcher James Trussell from Princeton University in New Jersey, who worked on the study. The data came from 233,805 first-trimester abortions done using the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol at 317 Planned Parenthood health centers. Eight women each year had an ectopic pregnancy - when the embryo implants outside the uterus - that was diagnosed after the attempted abortion. Of the 233,805 abortions during the study period, 385 women had a serious side effect, including 238 who sought ER treatment, 135 who were admitted to the hospital, 114 who had a blood transfusion and 57 who required intravenous antibiotics. She told Reuters Health medical abortions are still less common than surgical ones in the U.S., but that they’re becoming relatively more frequent and “women should be reassured” based on these and other data. One limitation, the study team noted, is that not all women checked back after the abortion or had follow up medical records available - so it’s possible more complications could have occurred that weren’t recorded. Planned Parenthood staff members were required to make three attempts to reach any patients who didn’t return for follow up visits under the organization’s medical standards and guidelines. “We assume that if anything had happened, that people would get back in touch with Planned Parenthood,” Trussell told Reuters Health. Two of the study’s authors are Planned Parenthood employees, and Trussell is a member of the National Medical Committee of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The medication regimen used by Planned Parenthood - and many other abortion providers - is slightly different than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug course because it includes lower doses of mifepristone and at-home use of misoprostol. Medical abortions done at Planned Parenthood run for about $300 to $800, according to its website. Julie: That’s right, and often we’re making telephone calls, we’re seeing people face-to-face with this dramatic information, and it’s extremely threatening and fearful for a lot of people, because they’re not expecting it. Yeah, I think people are welcome to attend meetings such as ASCO, but you know there are 30,000 people there and so it’s a fairly overwhelming experience, and it’s very hard to drill down. Morally, ethically, and legally, we simply cannot stand by and let someone die whose life we might be able to save.\" The story made national headlines. Sister Carol Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Association of the United States, defended St. Joseph’s decision to terminate the pregnancy. \"They had been confronted with a heartbreaking situation,\" she said in a formal statement. \"They carefully evaluated the patient’s situation and correctly applied the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services to it, saving the only life that was possible\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. The World Health Organization states \n\nWorld Health Organization: ; National Cancer Institute: ; American Cancer Society: ; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: ; American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:  The health risks of abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafely. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines unsafe abortions as those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities. Legal abortions performed in the developed world are among the safest procedures in medicine. In the United States as of 2012, abortion was estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth. CDC estimated in 2019 that US pregnancy-related mortality was 17.2 maternal \n\n per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" It appears that having had a prior surgical uterine evacuation (whether because of induced abortion or treatment of miscarriage) correlates with a small increase in the risk of preterm birth in future pregnancies. The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been \n\nThe CREST study compared the long-term effects of tubal sterilization to vasectomy. The study included 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization and 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. Studies of vasectomized monkeys showed accelerated atherosclerosis, but several large-scale human studies found no connection between vasectomy and vascular disease (307). Concerns about long-term safety recurred with the report of a possible association between prostate cancer and vasectomy (309). It is extremely likely that normal couples will experience at least one unwanted pregnancy at some time during their reproductive years. As a result, abortion is common. While there was a decline in the overall number of abortions worldwide from 46 million in 1995 to 42 million in 2003, this decline was greater in developed than in developing countries. About half of induced abortions are illegal and considered “unsafe” by the World Health Organization definition: procedures carried out either by an unskilled person or in unsafe conditions or both (313,314). As shown in Table 10.9 total abortion rates are quite similar over much of the world. What differs is the rate of safe abortions compared with unsafe abortions. In the developed countries, unsafe abortions are rare. A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. Vasectomy is a highly effective method. Vasectomy is not effective until all sperm are cleared by the reproductive tract. Proponents argue that research by the Guttmacher Institute, involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, \"I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life.\" He has also voiced opposition to the Helms Amendment that limits the United States in assistance to abortion through foreign aid, saying, \"a woman raped by the Taliban or Boko Haram should not be forced by the callousness of our government to bear her rapist’s child\". In 2016, Ojeda described himself as \"pro-life, with exceptions\". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”\n\n Harry Reid was anti-abortion and former President Jimmy Carter has expressed his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more pro-life, while former President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi favor abortion rights. Groups such as Democrats for Life of America represent the anti-abortion faction of the party while groups such as EMILY's List represent the abortion rights faction. A Newsweek poll from October 2006 found that 25% of Democrats were anti-abortion while a 69% majority was in favor of abortion rights. According to the 2020 Democratic Party platform, \"Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.\" In addition to environmental issues, her platform endorsed Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. She also supports universal background checks for gun purchases, keeping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in force, and overturning Citizens United v. FEC. In the Democratic primary, Bradshaw was one of five candidates, including the DSCC-supported Army veteran James Mackler.

He is also pro-gay marriage and was a cosponsor of legislation banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, but the bill failed in the House.

Coleman has campaigned as an anti-abortion candidate since at least 1993. He attributes this position to the death of two of his four children in infancy from a rare genetic disease. He supports limiting stem cell research to adult stem cells and stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, and in July 2006 voted against lifting restrictions on federal research dollars for new embryonic stem cell lines. Coleman is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports embryonic stem cell research. He voted in favor of legislative intervention to prolong the life of severely brain-damaged Floridian Terri Schiavo. Coleman opposes recognition of same-sex marriages by either the federal or state governments. In his 2002 Senate campaign he pledged support for an amendment to the United States Constitution that \n\nAbortion in Kansas is legal.

Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system. He was born with a rare congenital heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary atresia, which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. Kimmel usually ends his show with \"My apologies to Matt Damon, we ran out of time.\" Addressing his television audience on Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel tearfully thanked the doctors and nurses who saved the life of his son, born last week with a congenital heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with Pulmonary Atresia (PA). At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. The device, which Kimmel accurately likens to a sonogram of the heart, was developed with experimental research using animals. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive. Each will likely require a cardiopulmonary bypass—which mimics heart and lung function for the duration of surgery, keeping the patient alive. The device is an adaptation of early “heart-lung machines;” among the first iterations was a model created in the 1920s by research with canines. Thanks to the skill and expertise of pediatric cardiologists, working with cutting edge science and medicine developed through animal research, more than 63,000 children have been given a new chance at life with successful heart transplants. Many thousands more, including Kimmel’s son, have been successfully diagnosed and treated thanks to research performed with animal models. Last year we shared the emotional story of Lincoln Seay, an infant who survived open-heart surgery and a heart transplant after he was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. Manifestations of the condition vary, but, as in the case with Tetralogy of Fallot, it is often associated with cyanosis. It also hints at the potential\n\nMost people with heart failure do not need surgery and will be treated with drugs. Heart surgery is only done when doctors think it will improve a problem with the heart valves or the blood supply of the heart, and if the heart is strong enough. In most cases surgery cannot cure heart failure. Surgery that can be used to improve heart failure includes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgery and heart transplantation (see also ‘Medical devices for heart failure' and 'heart transplants for heart failure'). Another woman who had avoided seeing doctors about her heart for many years was given a new mitral valve and said the operation changed her life. She persuaded her surgeon to operate on her and felt her quality of life improved. She describes how wonderful she felt after her mitral valve was replaced. And just a good job that he was here because I collapsed and got rushed into hospital, spent 7 weeks in there because, you know, having 5 operations is a bit dicey as you can well imagine. And I finally got admitted to hospital in London and the surgeon there looked at my notes and he said, 'Definitely not, you've had far too many operations'. And I said to him 'oh dear' and he said, 'You surely don't want me to operate on you?' Kimmel was a member of Temple Emanu-El in New York City. Kimmel died April 15, 2008. For Ron Leigeb of Midland, however, traditional open heart surgery wasn't an option. He had undergone radiation therapy in the 1990s while being treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma. When he had open heart surgery in 2007, his surgeon noticed some damage to the bones in his chest caused by the radiation. \"For safety's sake, they decided they did not want to risk another open heart procedure,\" Leigeb said. \"The doctors told me the surgeon had done a great job putting me together before, but they did not want to take a chance on me.\" It involves using a catheter to insert an artificial aortic valve through an artery in the neck, leg or between the ribs, and placing it inside the patient's diseased heart valve while the heart is still beating. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, patients usually heal more quickly. On the other hand, TAVR is not appropriate for every patient. It is a more complex surgery, carries its own set of risks and requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of specialists representing the areas of interventional cardiology, advanced cardiac imaging and cardiothoracic surgery. On September 6, 2016, Interventional Cardiologist/Structural Heart Disease Specialist Nestor Mercardo, M.D., Ph.D., and Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeon Robert Jones, M.D., were part of the surgical team that repaired Leigeb's heart. \"Every morning while I was in the hospital, Dr. Mercado and Dr. Jones came in together to see me,\" Leigeb said. \"They checked the incision and my heartbeat, and talked with me. Leigeb was also impressed at how quickly he recovered from the procedure. At 69 years old, he was 10 years older than when he had the traditional open heart surgery, yet his recovery was much quicker. After the TAVR surgery, he had some soreness and bleeding, but those were quickly controlled and there were few restrictions. \"I could get in and out of bed, I could shower – I could do what I was doing before the surgery,\" he said. Leigeb completed a course of cardiac rehabilitation a few weeks after the surgery\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. Reportedly, that particular SDR enabled the young woman to ambulate, whereas before the surgery, she was too tight to do so. In \n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain. Nowadays, radiofrequency (RF) is one of the most effective options for treatment. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN in a shorter duration compared with CRF. The rapid and correct diagnosis is very important to determine prompt institution of treatment because the symptoms are so severe. For patients in whom medical treatment fails to control pain, microvascular decompression, glycerol rhizolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and percutaneous trigeminal microdecompression procedures have been used in an attempt to alleviate ITN . When the pharmacological treatment fails, a choice between minimally invasive technique and a surgical approach should be made. By far, one of the most common procedures to treat pain is the use of radiofrequency (RF) lesioning. Lesioning using RF current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing 'thermocoagulation' of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat . RF thermocoagulation has become the most common procedure for treating TN. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy have a lower risk\n\nTotal knee arthroplasty ensures patients a safe recover of function and pain relief. It is performed on millions of patients worldwide. Nevertheless, in a certain percentage of case there is an unexplainable persistence of pain in presence of a well-performed surgery. Radiofrequencies are used for the treatment of chronic nervous pain and also in some cases of osteoarthritis. Costs may be an issue, but once the patient has no pain, the rehabilitation is more effective and the surgery con is postponed or deleted. The most common location for residual pain after TKA is anteriorly, because residual pain has been associated with patellofemoral disorders. Identify the etiology of the residual pain can be a difficult diagnostic challenge and up to 10% to 15 % of patients may have unexplained pain. Possible explanations for such persistent pain complaints include inappropriate expectations, technical failures of\n\n sham therapy for chronic low back pain only in the short term immediately after treatment. A 2015 overview of systematic reviews of variable quality showed that acupuncture can provide short-term improvements \n\nA study conducted by Alessandro Napoli and his team at Sapienza University in Rome investigated the use of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) as a treatment for back pain resulting from lumbar disk herniation. The study included 128 patients who had not responded to conservative treatment for their back pain. These patients underwent CT-guided pRF, which delivers energy pulses to the root of the nerve for 10 minutes. Patients who received pulsed radiofrequency reported improvements in pain and disability scores. They also experienced quicker relief from leg pain and perceived faster recovery times. Based on these results, the researchers suggest offering pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disks and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy. This can be an attractive alternative to more invasive treatments, such as surgery or corticosteroid injections. Pulsed radiofrequency treatment is relatively non-invasive, only lasting 10 minutes, and a single session was sufficient for many patients in the study. In summary, the study on CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency as a treatment for back pain from lumbar disk herniation demonstrated favorable outcomes, including improved pain and disability scores, faster leg pain relief, and quicker perceived recovery times. This approach may offer benefits to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments and could potentially help them avoid invasive surgery or corticosteroid injections. Another 2017 clinical practice guideline, this one produced by the Danish Health Authority, recommended against acupuncture for both recent-onset low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy. Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though the use of such medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, transcutaneous electrical nerve \n\nA new study by Italian researchers investigated whether the use of pulsed radiofrequency can help relieve lower back pain and sciatica. This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica. The comparative study comparing the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain found that both CRF and PRF were effective in relieving pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2011, a large study conducted by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Slone Epidemiology Center in Massachusetts, reported a two-times increased risk of cleft palate birth defects among children exposed to Zofran during the early stages of pregnancy, when a developing fetus is most susceptible to harm. In August 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against GSK for allegedly marketing Zofran as an off-label treatment for pregnant women, which is illegal, and the drug maker was ordered to pay $3 billion to resolve the claims. On November 7, 2016, medical device company Biocompatibles Inc., a subsidiary of BTG plc agreed to pay $25 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by causing false claims to be submitted to government health care programs. The company allegedly promoted LC Bead, its embolization device—designed, to be inserted into blood vessels to block the flow of blood to tumors—for off-label use as a \"drug-delivery\" device, which was not an FDA-approved use and was not supported by substantial clinical evidence. How does Zofran cause birth defects? The FDA instructed GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to perform a study determining Zofran’s effects on heart activity. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Apr 22, 2015 | Comments Off on Are you currently pregnant and taking Zofran? A mother’s worry tends to set in as soon as the pregnancy test comes back positive. A teratogen is an agent such as drugs, medications, infections, or chemicals causing birth defects or harm to a fetus. Zofran, an antiemetic medication, is potentially linked to birth defects including cleft lip, cleft palate, and congenital heart defect (CHD). If you took Zofran during your first trimester of pregnancy, and have a child with birth defects, contact us for a free case consultation. No intervention was made by Purdue to contact the DEA for years despite knowing of the practice and the overuse and sale of their product. Both the United States and the state of Tennessee alleged that, from September 2008 through January 2010, the Antioch, Tenn.-based company submitted false claims to Medicare and TennCare for diabetes testing supplies, vacuum erection devices and heating pads. Prior to learning of the United States' and Tennessee's investigation, AmMed disclosed to the Medicare Administrative Contractors its failure to refund monies for returned supplies and began paying the refunds to Medicare \n\nAnother woman just filed a lawsuit against the maker of Fosamax (alendronate) over a femur fracture she suffered while on the osteoporosis medication. L-456712), and names Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Merck & Co., Inc. as defendants. The complaint states that the woman began treatment with Fosamax in December 2005 and suffered a right subtrochanteric femur fracture in July 2010. Merck won approval for Fosamax in 1995; the drug is intended to treat bone loss due to osteoporosis and osteopenia. The lawsuit also claims that the Merck knew, or should have known, about this defect, yet continued to market Fosamax without warning consumers. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that Fosamax and other bisphosphonates, such as Actonel or Boniva, may increase risks for atypical femur fractures in patients taking the medication to treat osteoporosis. The FDA has also recently published research about the risks and benefits of bisphosphonate therapy. The data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine this May. In fact, the national law firm recently filed several other, similar, lawsuits on behalf of women who took Fosamax and subsequently suffered fractures. We also recently wrote that another lawsuit, also filed by Parker Waichman LLP, in which a Maryland woman claimed that Merck’s Fosamax caused her double thigh fractures. Another recent study of adverse event reports involving Fosamax and other bisphosphonates found that the risk of esophageal cancer associated with these drugs might be higher than first thought. Last summer, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication to update the public on its ongoing\n\nA lawsuit was filed in California on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a heart defect. A lawsuit has been filed in California Superior Court on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during early pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a severe heart defect. According to court documents, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran (generic: ondansetron) for morning sickness during her first trimester of pregnancy. The complaint alleges the defect was the direct and proximate result of the baby’s exposure to Zofran in the womb. The Lampkin case, which was filed March 6, marks at least the third Zofran lawsuit to be filed against GSK since last month, all of which allege the drug caused serious congenital birth defects. According to the suit, plaintiff Cheri Flynn’s first child was born prematurely in 2004, and subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac septal defect (“hole in the heart”) and significant developmental delays. Plaintiff alleges she took Zofran for morning sickness during both pregnancies. All of the complaints cite much of the same evidence to support their allegations, including studies linking Zofran to heart defects, orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations. Plaintiffs also accuse the company of illegally marketing Zofran to treat morning sickness, when the drug has never been approved for such an indication.

Japan's former environment minister Nobuteru Ishihara was swiftly admitted to hospital after he tested positive for COVID-19 without showing symptoms. During the first months of the pandemic in the country, several government officials were reported to have been tested for COVID-19 without complying with the initial triage algorithm used by the Department of Health (DOH), which restricted asymptomatic individuals from being tested. Some family and staff members were also reportedly tested for COVID-19. On March 24, 2020, the Philippines had only tested 1,793 people due to the lack of testing kits. Public officials receiving quick results on their tests was perceived to be tantamount to receiving priority treatment as numerous people considered as actual patients under investigation – many of whom were front liners – were dying before their test results were out. In September 2020, with the improvement of testing capabilities and change in algorithm that focused on front liners and people who were in contact with COVID-infected patients, the government reported that over 3 million people had been tested. Federal health officials seek to make screening for the virus a routine part of doctor visits. The new strategy by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically urges the testing of all pregnant women, rather than relying upon them to volunteer. The change is intended to ensure that newborns receive highly effective drugs if their mothers are infected, which could dramatically reduce mother-to-child transmission from its current level of about 300 cases per year. More broadly, the guidelines are intended to make HIV testing a routine part of care in doctors' offices and clinics, rather than waiting for patients to specifically request it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines represent a \"much more aggressive approach toward HIV prevention\" nationally, which he said is \"a long time in coming.\" If mothers refuse, the CDC is asking states to test newborns for the virus so they can receive treatment if they are infected. Since this is now a preventable infection for a deadly disease, we really need to do the maximum we can to prevent transmission.\" Pregnant women are now routinely tested for several diseases, such as syphilis, rubella, Group B Strep and hepatitis, without being specifically asked for consent. Doctors say they can dramatically reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child if a woman takes anti-AIDS drugs during pregnancy and avoids breastfeeding after birth. The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\" On 7September, the UK government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\". Blood samples taken by the Chinese CDC from a random sampling of 34,000 Wuhan citizens one month after the virus first wave was contained showed 4.43% of people had antibodies which would equate to almost 500,000 infections. In the wider Hubei area 0.44% of those sampled were positive for antibodies, while of 12,000 nationally representative samples taken only two recorded positive results. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. The two main branches detect either the presence of the virus or of antibodies produced in response to infection. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports.

Embryos may be created by in vitro fertilization (IVF) with gametes from a male and female of the species to be reproduced. They may also be created by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into an egg cell of another species, creating a cloned embryo that transferred into the uterus of yet another species. Should Americans be allowed to edit their DNA to prevent genetic diseases in their children? That question, which once might have sounded like science fiction, is stirring debate as breakthroughs bring the idea closer to reality. Bioethicists and activists, worried about falling down the slippery slope to genetically modified Olympic athletes, are calling for more regulation. Anachronistic restrictions at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health effectively ban gene-editing research in human embryos that would lead to implantation and births. These prohibitions are inhibiting critical clinical research and should be lifted immediately. Curing genetic diseases has been a goal of biotechnology since the 1970s, when the molecular techniques for modifying DNA were invented. That altered DNA cannot be passed down to the patient's offspring. A string of qualified successes followed, with promising early results for afflictions ranging from fatal genetic diseases to Parkinson's. More controversial is editing the DNA of eggs, sperm and embryos, since those changes would be passed on to future generations. First, of the 58 embryos manipulated with a gene-editing system called Crispr, the MYBPC3 gene was repaired in 42—a rate of success that's unprecedented in this kind of study. Third, all of the cells in the successfully modified embryos contained the normal DNA. If one of the study's corrected embryos had been implanted in a woman's uterus, there's a reasonable chance it would have become a healthy baby. Last month a Chinese group led by Junjiu Huang announced it had used a refinement of the Crispr system on human embryos to correct the mutated gene responsible for a blood disorder called beta-thalassemia. As to the ethics, it would be unacceptable to modify normal embryos—the cliché about \"designer babies\"—but nobody is proposing to do that, and no American regulatory agency would approve it. If the concern is that embryos may be destroyed, parents with genetic diseases are already discarding many while using in vitro fertilization as a way to avoid passing on abnormal DNA. Fishel introduced embryo vitrification to the UK in 1991, with the first baby to be born in the country from this technique being delivered in October 1992. However, this procedure was then initially banned by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), a decision later criticised by Fishel when he gave a supplementary memorandum in parliament in 1997 as part of the Draft Human Tissue and Embryos Bill. Fishel has published more than 200 papers, as well as a number of books, including the 1986 bestseller In Vitro Fertilisation: Past Present \n\n In 1997, the National Consultative Committee for Ethics in the Life and Health Sciences, as well as other observers, noted that France's dignity-based laws on bio-medical research were paradoxical. The law prohibited research on human embryos created in France but permitted research on human embryos brought to France. They also have their own DNA, and mutations can cause hearing loss, diabetes, muscle weakness, seizures and heart problems. Their doctors bluntly told them that they should not expect to have a healthy biological child; because of the way mitochondrial mutations occur, each pregnancy would be like playing a game of reproductive roulette, the variable being how severely affected their baby would be. “They gave us a blank stare and very matter-of-factly told us there was really no way we would have another biological child,” says Evan. They were advised to consider adopting or using donor eggs. That’s when they learned about mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), a promising innovation in fertility treatments that could allow couples like the Shulmans to have healthy children. It involves replacing just the mutated mitochondria with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, while keeping the biological mother’s and father’s DNA intact. Where scientists and families see a desperately needed strategy for having a baby, ethicists and lawmakers see sticky questions of how to define parental rights and whether permanently rewriting someone’s genetic code is morally acceptable. But scientists face much stricter rules when it comes to\n\nControversial laws to allow three parents babies will be voted on by Parliament and could come into force next year. The government has laid down draft legislation which will change the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 to allow mitochondrial DNA transfer. The procedure, which was developed British scientists, is currently banned, but ministers want to change the law to prevent children suffering debilitating conditions like muscular dystrophy. Under the new rules, IVF (In-Vitro Fertilisation) clinics will be able to replace an egg's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor's egg. It is controversial because it would result in babies having DNA from three people – and effectively, two mothers. \"The Government has run a comprehensive and transparent process over the lifetime of this Parliament to review the public acceptability of mitochondrial donation and the ongoing evidence of safety and efficacy of the new techniques involved,” said public health minister Jane Ellison in a written statement. Around one in every 200 babies born in the UK has a severe mitochondrial disease. Although rare, the disorders can be passed to future generations through the maternal line. Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies said: “Mitochondrial donation will give women who carry severe mitochondrial disease the opportunity to have children without passing on devastating genetic disorders. If the new laws are voted in, it will be up to the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), to decide whether a treatment can go ahead on a case-by-case basis. Children born after mitochondrial transfer will not be entitled to discover the identity of the \"third parent\" donor. While many doctors and scientists applaud the move, pointing out that it could eliminate terrible diseases, critics argue \"mitochondrial transfer\" could lead to designer babies. Human trials can then begin immediately. The move was welcomed by scientists and charities. Scientists at Newcastle University, who developed one of the techniques already have a waiting list of women eager to take part in the first trials. Prof Mary Herbert, Professor of Reproductive Biology, Newcastle University said: “We are delighted that the government is taking this forward. “We believe that this technique could open up the possibility of motherhood untainted by the fear\n\n New eugenics was founded under the liberal ethical values of pluralism, which advocates for the respect of personal autonomy, and egalitarianism, which represents the idea of equality for all people. Ethical arguments against new eugenics include the claim that creating designer babies is not in the best interest of society as it might create a breach between genetically modified individuals and natural individuals.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope. The physiology of M. tuberculosis is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. The M. tuberculosis genome was sequenced in 1998.\n\n the last time anyone spoke to Guihard. The hospital determined that he had \n\n to allow exhumation of graves, which would permit determination of cause of death and identification of remains. A family member of a student who died at the school in 1934, and who wanted to reinter his remains, filed suit and gained an injunction against the state's moving ahead with the sale before remains could be exhumed and identified. The state responded to the court injunction and authorized more work by a multi-disciplinary team from the University of South Florida, including exhumations. Three times \n\n Humans are the only known reservoirs of M. tuberculosis. A misconception is that M. tuberculosis can be spread by shaking hands, making contact with toilet seats, sharing food or drink, or sharing toothbrushes. However, major spread is through air droplets originating from a person who has the disease either coughing, sneezing, speaking, or singing. When in the lungs, M. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, but they are unable to kill and digest the bacterium. been notified and have been offered prophylactic antibiotics as well. Laboratory testing may be done to confirm the presence of the bacteria, which involves taking a specimen from the back of the patient's throat. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus group. Dr. Robert Woodward, medical director of McKinley Health Center, and his staff are contacting friends and roommates of the student, who lives on the fourth floor of Leonard Hall, as a means of identifying others who might be at risk. Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator Julie Pryde remembered a particularly serious outbreak in 2008 when two students were affected. Most people have natural immunity to the disease and will never fall ill from it, even with close exposure. Most of the public are immunized against the most common type of meningitis among adults. Secondary cases of the disease are not common, but they are preventable by taking appropriate medication. There are a number of effective antibiotics, and medical prevention can be as simple as taking a single dose of antibiotic within the first few days following exposure, the UI said. The Meningitis Foundation of America offers extensive information regarding diagnosis, immunization, recovery and the after effects of meningitis. ***MFA survives entirely by donations. M. tuberculosis, then known as the \"tubercle bacillus\", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as \"Koch's bacillus\". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. A contaminated droplet can infect any person and they can become contaminated with M. tuberculosis. They thus become part of the 1.8 billion people worldwide who are currently struggling with this disease. This may have \n\n  The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is generally spread when an infected person coughs and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the lungs, but can spread to any part of the body. Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria. But, TB can remain dormant in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. Just one to three mumps cases are reported each year in San Diego County, and are usually related to travel overseas, according to the county Health and Human Services Agency. HHSA officials said there have been outbreaks of mumps, for which there is no cure, at several colleges and universities in the Midwest and East Coast. \"USD has been working closely with the county to notify individuals who were directly exposed to the mumps cases,\" said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer. According to the HHSA, the best way to prevent mumps is by getting the MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella -- vaccine. On March 1, I issued an important email about a confirmed mumps case on campus. The patient, a fully immunized nonresidential undergraduate student has recovered fully and is now back on campus. In light of additional confirmed or suspected cases, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has issued an important message to University of San Diego students. Please read the letter from Dr. Eric McDonald, Medical Director, Epidemiology & Immunizations Services Branch, Public Health Services here. Dr. McDonald recommends that all undergraduate students and residential staff receive an additional dose of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine regardless of prior MMR vaccination history. Graduate students, faculty and staff are at lower risk due to more limited close contact exposure and an additional dose of MMR vaccine is currently not recommended for these groups, although any member of the USD community may receive it.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The spaces most commonly affected by smoking bans are indoor workplaces and buildings open to the public such as restaurants, bars, office buildings, schools, retail stores, hospitals, libraries, transport facilities, and government buildings, in addition to public transport vehicles such as aircraft, buses, watercraft, and trains. However, laws may also prohibit smoking in outdoor areas such as parks, beaches, pedestrian plazas, college and hospital campuses, and within a certain distance from the entrance to a building. The most common rationale cited for restrictions on smoking is the negative health effects associated with secondhand smoke (SHS), or the inhalation of tobacco smoke by persons who are not smoking. The ban did not include workplaces, but covered all other indoor public spaces and its enforcement was somewhat limited. In the United States, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. California's ban included a controversial restriction upon smoking in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban. Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place \n\n as cigars to avoid the ban. A 2016 analysis of data from the 1999–2013 National Youth Tobacco Surveys suggests that the ban reduced adolescent cigarette use—both probability of smoking a cigarette and number of cigarettes used by smokers—although there was an increase in adolescent use of menthols, smokeless tobacco, flavored cigars, and pipes, suggesting substitution towards the remaining legal flavored tobacco products. Canada banned flavored additives in combustible tobacco products—cigarettes, little cigars, and rolling papers—in 2009, excluding menthol. \"At the end of the day, smoking is harmful regardless of whether it's legal or illegal.\" Surgeon General found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars might see increased business. In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law to include virtually all restaurants and bars, including those in private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, one of the toughest in the United States. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the \n\nAfter the implementation of the Romanian national clean air law, there were several changes in the smoke-free rules in the foster care system. These measures included bans on non-cigarette tobacco products, non-smoking on premises for both adults and children, and no smoking in cars to transport children. Specifically, there was a 10.6% increase in bans on non-cigarette tobacco products, an 18.3% increase in non-smoking on premises for adults, a 10.3% increase in non-smoking on premises for children, and a 9% increase in the prohibition of smoking in cars to transport children. However, the perception of indoor smoking bans did not change significantly. Overall, the implementation of the Romanian national clean air law seemed to have a positive impact on strengthening smoke-free rules in the foster care system. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in ensuring smoke-free environments in cars that are used to transport children in foster care. In Sweden, use of snus, as an alternative to smoking, has risen steadily since that nation's smoking ban. Smoking restrictions may make it easier for smokers to quit. A study of Massachusetts youths, found that those in towns with smoking bans were 35 percent less likely to be habitual smokers. The implementation of comprehensive smoking bans has been associated with several health benefits. For example, studies in Italy and New York State found declines in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction after the implementation of smoking bans (Barone-Adesi et al., 2006; Juster et al., 2007). Smoking bans have also been found to improve respiratory health. The bans resulted in improved air quality, reduced exposure to second-hand smoke, and decreased respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, comprehensive smoking bans have had beneficial effects on the health of children. Bans on smoking in cars have also been associated with positive respiratory health effects in children (Kabir et al., 2009). Additionally, smoking bans have been linked to improvements in maternal and infant health. Overall, comprehensive smoking bans have demonstrated numerous health benefits including reduced rates of heart attacks, improved respiratory health in both adults and children, and positive effects on maternal and infant health. According to a 2015 review, passive smoking may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection and accelerate the progression of the disease, but the evidence remains weak. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking was associated with a slightly increased risk of allergic diseases\n\nThe American Lung Association has a proud history of fighting for lung health. The Lung Association is now working with state governments to ensure that they implement the rule in a way that maximizes benefits to public health. The most recent success came in March 2014, when the Lung Association helped U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announce cleaner gasoline and improved vehicle technology—the latest step to clean up emissions. We took legal action to support EPA's efforts to reduce pollution blown across state lines in a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in 2014. After two decades of persistent effort, we successfully convinced Congress to strengthen the Clean Air Act, requiring cities to enact specific air pollution control measures. Over the past 25 years, Lung Association legal action has resulted in more protective air quality standards as well as holding the federal government to its obligation to clean up pollution sources. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have passed comprehensive laws prohibiting smoking in almost all public places and workplaces, including restaurants and bars, that meet the Lung Association's Smokefree Air Challenge. We won't stop until everyone lives and works in a smokefree city or state.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The case fatality rate for COVID-19 has been much lower than the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, but transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Model-based simulations for Argentina indicate that the 95% confidence interval for the time-varying reproduction number R exceeded 1.0 from April to July 2020, after which it diminished to below 1.0 in October and November 2020. Timeline February 2020 After the cruise ship Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Port of Yokohama in Japan after 10 passengers were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, among the passengers diagnosed positive was the first Argentine infected, a 61-year-old man travelling with his wife, who had no symptoms. The patient was later transferred to a hospital in Japan.

A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the \n\nUniversal use of ultrasound to screen nulliparous women in the third trimester roughly triples the detection of small for gestational age (SGA) infants; moreover, combining ultrasound measurements of the estimated weight and of the growth velocity of a fetus identified a subset of small babies at increased risk of neonatal morbidity. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors Various risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are: Prematurity High exposure to oxygen Low birth weight Various types of infections Cardiac defects Anaemia Low vitamin E level Pathophysiology During development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment.

However, the study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Committee,which determined the safety and efficacy of the treatment, believedphysicians who provide care for premature infants should be informedof these findings. Study investigators examined 3862 premature infants whose low birth-weight put them at risk for ROP. However, 291 infants developed severe ROP and, after the informed consent of their parents was obtained, were entered into the cryotherapy study. The preliminary results concern 172 of these infants. All the premature infants enrolled in the CRYO-ROP Study were at least 28 days old, weighed less than 2.76 pounds at birth, had no other major eye or systemic abnormalities, and had ROP that had reached a threshold level of severity (“Stage 3 with plus’ disease” according to the International Classification ofRetinopathy of Prematurity) in at least on eye.

WHO recommended schedule, which is universally recommended is as follows: \n\n in table below) 84.7% of normal delivery participants did not feed anything other than breast milk to their babies while 78% of C-sectioned participants fed formula to their babies after they had started breastfeeding. The participants assumed that formula-fed babies were more likely to gain weight more quickly than breastfed babies. These might be the major increasing drawbacks for the practice of exclusive breastfeeding in Nepal. The perspective towards breastfeeding is found to be optimistic, believing to the benefits of breastfeeding were not only for a limited period; is always convenient, healthier and cheaper than formula. Exclusive breastfeeding has always been considered as an ideal food for the baby up to six months after birth. ; A predictive model using blinded ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) at 36 weeks, maternal age, height, BMI and weight gain correctly identifies women at increased risk of emergency C-section: in this study 48% of screen-positive women delivered by C-section. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Childhood malnutrition and growth faltering affects more than half of children under five in developing countries, and usually starts during infancy, possibly due to improper breastfeeding and mixed feeding practices. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS,\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Due to these techniques, there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions, and use of pain medication. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery. Memory devices play an essential role in preventing any inconveniences in the robot-assisted surgery. This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear. Articles in the newly created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon's experience. Complications related to robotic surgeries range from converting the surgery to open, re-operation, permanent injury, damage to viscera and nerve damage. From 2000 to 2011, out of 75 hysterectomies done with robotic surgery, 34 had permanent injury, and 49 had damage to the viscera. Additional surgical training is needed to operate the system. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must perform 150 to 250 procedures to become adept in their use. During the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie-ups and surgical staffs keeping patients \n\nStudy finds complication rate similar to other minimally invasive technique, but higher cost. \"The robotically assisted procedure was substantially more expensive,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Jason Wright, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City. Robotically assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopic surgery, but the surgeon uses a robotic device instead of a laparoscope to do the procedure. Dr. Michael Zinner, chief of surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said there are advantages to robotically assisted surgery in certain situations. If the surgeon has any slight tremor, the machine evens it out,\" he said. Robotically assisted hysterectomies were performed 0.5 percent of the time in 2007. The rate of laparoscopic surgery also increased during this time period, from 24.3 percent\n\n are also current methods of robotic surgery being marketed and advertised online. In the US alone, many websites promotion robotic surgery fail to mention any risks associated with these types of procedures, and hospitals providing materials largely ignore risks, overestimate benefits and are strongly influenced by the manufacturer. Robotic surgery in the field of urology has become common, especially in the United States. There is inconsistent evidence of benefits compared to standard surgery to justify the increased costs. In 2000, the first robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed. Robotic surgery has also been utilized in radical cystectomies. The first report of robotic surgery in gynecology was published in 1999 from the Cleveland Clinic The adoption of robotic surgery has contributed to the increase in minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic disease. Gynecologic procedures may take longer with robot-assisted surgery and the rate of complications may be higher, but there are not enough high-quality studies to know at the present time. In the United States, robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign conditions was shown to be more expensive than conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy in 2015, with no difference in overall rates of complications. This includes the use of the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic oncology. Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids, abnormal periods, endometriosis, ovarian tumors, uterine prolapse, and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, myomectomies, and lymph node biopsies. However, open surgery has demonstrated better success rates and shorter surgery time when compared to the other modalities. Recent findings There are limited studies in the literature comparing these three different surgical approaches. Principally, the minimally invasive approach allows for a significant reduction in the morbidity associated with the open surgical incision, resulting in decreased use of pain medication, quicker recovery and decreased length of hospital stay. Moreover, the use of rigid laparoscopic instruments results in the loss of haptic (force and touch) feedback and dexterity (40 compared to 70 of freedom with open surgery). In addition, these instruments allow for the transmission of tremors and require counterintuitive movements (due to the fulcrum effect by the trocars), which adds to the technical challenge and complexity of advanced maneuvers such as intracorporeal suturing. Together, these advantages allow the surgeon to perform laparoscopic movements more precisely and easily, compared to CLS. Despite these technical advantages, adoption of RALS\n\n anesthesia for longer periods. Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On January 31, 2014, reports of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths in men taking FDA-approved testosterone-replacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating the issue. Later, in September 2014, the FDA announced, as a result \n\n Testosterone (T) is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported \"the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.\" Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, \"sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales.\" Many Testim lawsuits have already been filed against Endo for injuries caused by the testosterone gel. Testosterone regulates growth and the development of male gender characteristics. When applied topically, Testim gel increases bone density, muscle growth and libido, enhances sexual function and increases energy levels. The formulation was designed for use in men aged 18 and older who do not produce enough natural testosterone due to a malfunction of the testes, known as hypogonadism. Unfortunately, many men have been prescribed testosterone gel and replacement therapy for age-related decline of male hormones or “low-T” which has been a popular advertising subject. This use of testosterone is not approved by the FDA and may increase the chance for serious complications. The studies showed that men who are treated with hormone supplement therapy may experience heart attack or stroke at a three times greater rate than those who do not take the medications. March 2015, the FDA ordered Testim and other testosterone manufacturers to update product labels with information about an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. In June of 2015, the labels were again updated to include a warning regarding a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), venous blood clots that include deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n\nBio-T-Gel (testosterone gel) is a popular hormone replacement product for men. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that testosterone can thicken the blood and elevate blood pressure, which substantially increases the risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke — especially for older men and those who have heart disease. Bio-T-Gel (testosterone gel) is a product that was approved in February 2012 for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone) in conjunction with a medical condition like undescended testicles, chemotherapy side effects, or brain disorders. These problems are so common, it is no wonder that prescriptions for testosterone have increased five-fold since 2000 — yet only 50% of men actually have hypogonadism. Evidence linking testosterone and heart problems has been growing since at least 2009, when researchers halted a clinical trial after 7% of men on testosterone had a cardiovascular event, compared to 1% on a placebo. Since then, numerous studies have backed up these findings. One study found that men over 65 had twice as many heart attacks as men who did not take testosterone. Another study found that men on testosterone were nearly 30% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular event in the first 90 days of treatment. Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. The changes were more pronounced with oral testosterone undecanoate than with parenteral routes, such as transdermal testosterone. Testosterone showed no significant effect on depressed mood anxiety, bone mineral density (BMD), or anthropomorphic measures like body weight or body mass index. Conversely, it was associated with a significant incidence of androgenic side effects, including acne and hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth). The conclusion is that insufficient levels of either nutrient increases the risk of cardiovascular events. The gel, which is made from ordinary brown seaweed, is injected into the heart using a catheter fed through a vein in the groin.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease). Those wishing to know the incidence of tick-borne diseases in their town or state can search the LMZ surveillance database. Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Another issue that exists with high deer density is the spreading of infectious diseases. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the country and is found in twelve states in Eastern America. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n Sweden, Switzerland, France, and Laos ; Vector/region(s)#1: Ixodes ricinus is the main European vector.

Summit County is one of five counties in Utah that has had a report of Lyme disease. Utah has traditionally been safe from Lyme and many other insect-borne diseases, thanks to its long, cold winters — but appears to be changing. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports of Lyme disease in Utah have been trending upward over the past decade and a half. Most Utahns who contract Lyme disease still get the infection while traveling the East Coast, said Dallin Peterson, an epidemiologist and specialist in insect- and animal-borne diseases for the Utah Department of Health. But, he said, one of the tick species known to carry the bacteria that causes Lyme, the Western black-legged tick, has migrated to Utah. Traditionally, that species has mostly inhabited Washington, Oregon and California, Peterson said, but recently it appears to be moving east into Idaho and Utah. Climate change is likely helping to spread disease-carrying insects into the state, which has been relatively free of insect-borne diseases. In temperate states, cold winter weather should kill large numbers of young ticks each year. The number of Western black-legged ticks in Utah is thought to still be too low to cause a Lyme disease outbreak, but officials are developing a statewide surveillance system to monitor the pest’s migration. Lyme isn’t the only disease of concern, Peterson said. Utahns regularly report cases of tick-borne diseases, including Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Mosquito-borne illnesses remain Peterson’s primary concern. The disease has turned up in Southern California and Nevada and may be headed toward Utah, Peterson said. Changing climate and its effects on habitats also have introduced new species of wildlife to some areas, LeFevre said, which has encouraged the spread of the ticks. The western blacklegged tick is the most common variety found in California. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. For example, from 1985 to 2013, the CDH collected 15,236 ticks in Los Angeles County, 5,973 in Riverside County, 917 in San Bernardino County and 866 in Orange County. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease. Confirmed cases vary from 0 to 8 per year and many of those are from people who visited places outside of Southern California. Only about 1 percent of the ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi. And new studies say global climate change may be increasing the range of disease-carrying ticks and the amount of time they are active.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Another outbreak occurred in the state of New York between 2018 and 2019, causing over 200 confirmed measles cases in mostly ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in New Jersey and Washington state with over 30 cases reported in the Pacific Northwest. European countries with endemic measles in 2018 were: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Measles is an endemic disease, meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance. In April, the CDC reported that 400,000 fewer doses of measles vaccine were ordered in 2020 compared to the same time last year. Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious. Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox. Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite Hispanic and African American children under 5 years old. In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States. have occurred elsewhere as well. Since the discovery of the anti-MOG specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that ADEM is one of the possible clinical causes of anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis About how the anti-MOG antibodies appear in the patients serum there are several theories:\n\nThe number of people with measles in Indiana this month has grown to 17 with a fresh case linked to an unvaccinated person who travelled to a country where the disease is prevalent, state health officials said on Monday. Measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease which in some cases can lead to hearing loss, pneumonia and death, is relatively rare in the United States due to high vaccination rates. One of the 2011 outbreaks also was in Indiana. Dr. Jorge Parada, professor of medicine and direction of the infection prevention and control program at Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago, said the reason for the increased cases of measles in the U.S. was reduced rates of vaccination. Transmission had occurred in Indiana this year in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccinated status, according to Indiana health department spokeswoman Amy Reel. According to the 2010 CDC National Immunization Survey, over 92 percent of Indiana children aged 19-35 months have at least one dose of the MMR or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The Adams County case has been traced to an unvaccinated person travelling to a country where measles is prevalent, according to the state health department. State and county Health Departments were investigating the new case to prevent further transmission. While no longer infectious, officials warn that people who visited the Bluffton Regional Medical Center on February 20 may have been exposed to the disease when the measles sufferer went to the emergency room that evening. No additional cases have been reported as a result of the Super Bowl Village exposure. Three-quarters of all U.S. measles cases last year were transmitted locally, within the United States, rather than being picked up in another country. Two-thirds of people who avoid vaccination cite religious or philosophical reasons, Parada said.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This was particularly true for the health sector which, like climate change, was a priority for the Obama administration. There would be about $485 billion in safety net spending, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, increased funding utilities payments and job training for low-income individuals, and a 25% increase in aid to disabled veterans. In 2018, Congress passed the annual Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill before the end of the fiscal year for the first time in over 20 years. The alliance supported passage of both bills. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities.

The House of Representatives voted to include an emergency grant of $25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots. On August 14, 2020, President Trump said he was willing to approve USPS funding if concessions were made to some funding asks in coronavirus relief package. The HEALS Act includes increased funding for schools and higher learning institutions, as well as hospitals. The HEALS Act would not provide additional funding for state and local governments short on tax revenue due to shutdowns and business closures, and would also reduce expanded unemployment benefits from $600 per week to $200. She indicated House Democrats were willing to negotiate reducing the House bill's cost to $2.2 trillion.\" The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate. The Heroes Act includes about $1.13 trillion of emergency supplemental appropriations to federal agencies, as well as economic assistance to governments at the state, local, tribal, and territorial levels. There would be about $485 billion in safety net spending, including the expansion of unemployment benefits, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, increased funding utilities payments and job training for low-income individuals, and a 25% increase in aid to disabled veterans. There would be about $382 billion for health care, which would include reimbursing health care providers for lost revenue, covering the COBRA premium costs \n\n On January 14, 2021, President-elect Joe Biden introduced a $1.9 trillion relief plan which would include $1,400 direct payments, weekly federal unemployment benefits, amongst other measures. The Democrats used the procedure of reconciliation to circumvent a filibuster—expediting the approval of the bill's cost, while leaving room to negotiate amendments. On January 31, 2021, ten Senate Republicans announced a $600 billion counterproposal to Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion bill. On February 2, the Senate passed a budget resolution along party lines. The House Budget Committee combined separate aid bills into one piece of legislation on February 19. The bill was passed by the House on February 27 and (after being amended) the Senate on March 6. It was passed again by the House on March 10, and signed by Biden on March 11.\n\n their economies. The White House Coronavirus Task Force was led by Vice President Mike Pence, Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah Birx, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Congress appropriated $8.3billion in emergency funding, which Trump signed into law on March 6. In the next administration, President Trump said the healthcare system should work based on free market principles. However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%). There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge. In 2009, the U.S. had the highest health care costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, with an estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 16% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) without insurance coverage.

Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. , 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it. Historically, abortions have been attempted using \n\n 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR). 14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical \n\n to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" Historically, abortion has been prevalent, especially during the years following the Bangladesh Liberation War. For example, in 1972, the law allowed for abortion for those women who has been raped during the war. As a result, some women turn to illegal abortions. Abortion An abortion can be legally performed by a physician in a hospital, if it is necessary to save the life of the mother. According to an article by the Guttmacher Institute, which studied the rural district of Matlab, illegal abortion is becoming increasingly prevalent despite the availability of safer methods of fertility control. A study by Mizanur Rahman and Julie DaVanzo showed that between 2000 and 2008, a woman was more likely to die from the complications of unsafe abortion than from childbirth itself, and that death rates from childbirth were similar of the death rates for the complications of menstrual regulation.

The clinic invests significant effort into counseling pregnant women, and providing prenatal care and vitamins. ; A novel biomarker for pre-eclampsia, 4-hydroxyglutamate, improves current first-trimester prediction of the preterm disease. ; A clinically useful screening test for pre-eclampsia and FGR combines placentally-derived proteins measured in the maternal serum (i.e. the ratio of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1) to placental growth factor (PlGF)) and ultrasonic estimation of fetal weight. ; The placenta exhibits a unique sex-dependent difference in polyamine metabolism, which is associated with placental-specific escape from X-chromosome inactivation by the enzyme spermine synthase (SMS); moreover, maternal serum levels of polyamine metabolites differ by fetal sex and strongly differentially associate with the great obstetrical syndromes, namely higher maternal serum levels of N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) increases the risk of pre-eclampsia but \n\n Medical testing and care can be performed in order to prevent intrauterine hypoxia, though can be difficult. These tests don't directly detect hypoxia, but instead detects the general well-being of the baby and ensures that the baby is healthy since hypoxia causes a wide range of responses. These tests can include prenatal testing, such as fetal movement and amniotic fluid levels, Doppler examination, or fetal heart rate. Another risk factor is premature birth in which medical intervention, such as premature birth prevention or C-section delivery, can be used as prevention for intrauterine hypoxia. Studies have shown a connection between tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency and hypoxia-ischemia brain injury, though further studies need to be done. Measuring fetal BH4 levels can be another way to look out for intrauterine hypoxia. During birth, birth asphyxia can occur in which cardiotocograph can be used to monitor the baby's health during labor. But sometimes delivery occurs sooner than expected. Strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend all prenatal checkups. While the majority of premature births result from unexpected, spontaneous preterm labor (often following premature rupture of the membranes), 20 percent are early inductions due to pregnancy complications such as vaginal bleeding; uterine abnormalities; as well as health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and urinary tract infections. In such cases, early delivery may be the safest route for mother and baby. Because many of these conditions are often symptomless, they are difficult to prevent and diagnose in pregnancy. Women who smoke, drink, or use illegal drugs may also have a higher risk of delivering prematurely. Unfortunately, there are additional inborn factors that may increase your risk of preterm labor. ; A predictive model using blinded ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) at 36 weeks, maternal age, height, BMI and weight gain correctly identifies women at increased risk of emergency C-section: in this study 48% of screen-positive women delivered by C-section. ; Maternal serum level of Delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1), protein involved in the regulation of maternal metabolic state and fetal growth in mice, differentiates constitutionally small and pathologically small (or fetal growth restricted) human fetuses. What Health Risks Do Preemies Face? Even if you do everything right, you may still deliver prematurely. If you&apos;re planning a pregnancy, see your doctor for a preconception checkup. She can identify health risks, such as STDs, that may contribute to preterm labor. If you&apos;ve delivered prematurely before, your doctor can inject you during pregnancy with progesterone, a hormone that might reduce your\n\nScientists at UC San Francisco have developed a test to predict a woman’s risk of preterm birth when she is between 15 and 20 weeks pregnant, which may enable doctors to treat them early and thereby prevent severe complications later in the pregnancy. It is often associated with inflammation and has many potential causes, including an acute infection in the mother, exposure to environmental toxins, or chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The new test screens for 25 biomarkers of inflammation and immune system activation, as well as for levels of proteins that are important for placenta development. Combined with information on other risk factors, such as the mother’s age and income, the test can predict whether a woman is at risk for preterm birth with more than 80 percent accuracy. In the highest risk pregnancies—preterm births occurring before 32 weeks or in women with preeclampsia, a potentially fatal pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure in the mother—the test predicted nearly 90 percent of cases. The researchers also wanted to be able to identify risk for preeclampsia, which is not included in current tests for preterm birth. Based on a woman’s probability of preterm birth derived by the test, she could discuss with her clinician how best to follow-up and try to lower her risk. Some cases of preterm birth, including those caused by preeclampsia, can be prevented or delayed by taking aspirin, but treatment is most helpful if started before 16 weeks. Physicians could also evaluate high-risk women for underlying infections that may have gone undetected but could be treated. For others, close monitoring by their doctor could help flag early signs of labor like cervical shortening that can be staved off with progesterone treatment. A test for preterm birth is currently available, but it is\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The strongest predictor of osteoarthritis is increased age, likely due to the declining ability of chondrocytes to maintain the structural integrity of cartilage. This includes studies on supplements containing glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Additionally, oral joint supplements may have questionable bioavailability. Elgenoflex along with the right diet, weight loss, exercise and pain medications can help reduce moderate to severe pain of patients with osteoarthritis. Degenerative and dystrophic diseases of the musculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, etc. The vast majority of supplements to support joint, and connective tissue health contain glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), as well as their combinations, which are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate and makes the supplement more effective for patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. One \n\nChondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use Chondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects Clinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology Mechanisms of action The effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose.

The analysis determined that there was a 6% risk of developing deep vein thrombosis when wearing knee-high stockings and 4% when wearing thigh-high stockings, but also found significant heterogeneity, and thus it concluded that there is not enough evidence that that one length is superior to the other, and suggests that knee-high compression stockings should be the first choice \n\n Major orthopedic surgery—total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgery—has a high risk of causing VTE. Following major orthopedic surgery, a blood thinner or aspirin is typically paired with intermittent pneumatic compression, which is the preferred mechanical prophylaxis over graduated compression stockings. After low-risk surgeries, early and frequent walking is the best preventive measure. Partial knee replacement offers several advantages over full knee replacement for patients with osteoarthritis in just one part of the knee. Since only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced in a partial knee replacement, the surgery is less invasive compared to a total knee replacement. Because a partial knee replacement involves a smaller incision and preserves healthy bone and cartilage in the rest of the knee, patients typically experience less pain after the procedure compared to a full knee replacement. Partial knee replacement also tends to involve less blood loss compared to a full knee replacement. Therefore, it is essential to consult with an orthopedic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment option based on an individual's specific condition and needs.

Now, a recent study reveals that heavy marijuana use could compromise the dopamine system. Heavy marijuana use is linked with decreased dopamine release in the brain, researchers say. The researchers, who publish their work in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, say that heavy cocaine and heroin use have been shown to decrease dopamine release, but until now, such data regarding cannabis was notably absent. To further investigate whether marijuana dependence is linked with similar effects, the researchers conducted their study in 11 adults aged 21-40 years who were heavily dependent on marijuana, and they matched them with 12 healthy controls. The adults in the marijuana group started using it at around age 16 on average, became dependent by age 20 and had been dependent for around 7 years. Results showed that, compared with the control group, the marijuana users' striatum had lower dopamine release. \"We don't know whether decreased dopamine was a preexisting condition or the result of heavy cannabis use. But the bottom line is that long-term, heavy cannabis use may impair the dopaminergic system, which could have a variety of negative effects on learning and behavior.\" In jail for 72 hours after the arrest, Kubby was deprived of medical marijuana and became seriously ill. His blood pressure shot up to dangerous levels. In addition, while there are no fatal overdose cases linked to marijuana, there are deaths linked to synthetic cannabinoids each year. Participants from Oakland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Birmingham were repeatedly measured for pulmonary function, height, smoking behavior, and waist circumference and asked about cigarette and marijuana smoking during each assessment. “People who smoke marijuana inhale very deeply, which may strengthen the muscles used for inhalation – basically making them good at the test. Subjects who smoked larger amounts of marijuana, which Pletcher described as smoking one joint per day, did show evidence of reduced pulmonary function, and he stressed that his study results are not intended to encourage people to use marijuana. However, for patients for whom medical marijuana may be a treatment option, the authors write that \"marijuana may have beneficial effects on pain control, appetite, mood, and management of other chronic symptoms. Our findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana for these or other purposes may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function. It’s important to note that the findings of this study are not meant to encourage marijuana smoking, nor did the study examine other known negative effects of marijuana use, which include problems with memory, concentration and perception. Long term use of marijuana can lead to addiction, and chronic marijuana use is associated with mental health problems including anxiety and depression. Studies have shown that when marijuana use begins at a younger age, it may increase mental health problems, including psychosis, according to NIDA. However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. Heavy marijuana use has been associated with potential effects on the brain's dopamine system. According to a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, heavy marijuana use is linked to decreased dopamine release in the brain. This finding is similar to what is observed in heavy cocaine and heroin use. However, chronic drug use, including heavy marijuana use, can blunt the release of dopamine during the chronic phase of drug dependence. In the study mentioned, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the release of dopamine in the brains of marijuana users. They found that heavy marijuana users had decreased dopamine release compared to healthy controls. It is important to note that this study was conducted on heavy marijuana users who were heavily dependent on the drug, and the effects of moderate or occasional use were not specifically investigated. Additionally, the study focused on the acute effects of marijuana abstinence in heavy users. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of heavy marijuana use on the brain's dopamine system and to examine potential differences in effects based on frequency and duration of use. It is also important to consider individual factors such as genetics and other co-occurring conditions that may influence the brain's response to marijuana use. If you have concerns about heavy marijuana use or its potential effects on the brain's dopamine system, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist who can provide personalized guidance and support.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Despite politically charged disputes over the numbers, however, the Kenyan government recently declared HIV/AIDS a national disaster. In 2004 the Kenyan Ministry of Health announced that HIV/AIDS had surpassed malaria and tuberculosis as the leading disease killer in the country. Due largely to AIDS, life expectancy in Kenya has dropped by about a decade. In 2017, the number \n\n people in Kenya living with HIV/AIDs was 1 500 000 and the prevalence rate was 4.8% of the total population.

In recent years, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), also has become a severe problem. Estimates of the incidence of infection differ widely. The life expectancy in Kenya in 2016 was 69.0 for females and 64.7 for males. The leading cause of mortality in Kenya in the year 2016 included diarrhoea diseases 18.5%, HIV/AIDs 15.56%, lower respiratory infections 8.62%, tuberculosis 3.69%, ischemic heart disease 3.99%, road injuries 1.47%, interpersonal violence 1.36%. The leading causes of DALYs in Kenya in 2016 included HIV/AIDs 14.65%, diarrhoea diseases 12.45%, lower back and neck pain 2.05%, skin and subcutaneous diseases 2.47%, depression 1.33%, interpersonal violence 1.32%, road injuries 1.3%. The burden of disease in Kenya has mainly been from communicable diseases but it is now shifting to also include the noncommunicable diseases and injuries. Malaria remains a major public health problem in Kenya and accounts for an estimated 16 percent of outpatient consultations. Approximately 70 percent of the population is at risk for malaria, with 14 million people in endemic areas, and another 17 million in areas of epidemic and seasonal malaria.

A particular example of the disease threats sex workers are faced with can be demonstrated via a study conducted in Cambodia where the rate of HIV has increased. This report studied the prevalence of HIV among a group of indirect sex workers in Cambodia called \"beer promotion girls\", women employed by distributors to promote and sell beers. The study found that they have the highest rate of HIV because they often sell sex as a means of supplementing their salary. This report also found that among indirect sex\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

As always, a key issue is how benefits and complications of such agents compare with statins—molecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. It may accelerate pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. Ethnic groups have different rates of prostate cancer. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. ; Several \n\n Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC)  but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. However, it was stopped early in 2008 because no protective effect of supplementation on prostate cancer risk was found, and because the results suggested that vitamin E might increase the risk. Feb. 18, 2008 (San Francisco) -- Men with prostate cancer who take cholesterol-lowering statin drugs or anti-inflammatory drugs live longer than those who don't take the drugs, a new study suggests. \"We found an association between both statin and NSAID use and the risk of dying of any cause,\" says researcher Matthew Katz, MD, of Saints Medical Center in Lowell, Mass. Both treatments are effective, with a high cure rate in localized disease. The researchers defined medication use as any use of the drugs after surgery or radiation treatment. Taking statins or NSAIDs within 12 months after prostate cancer treatment did not extend lives, Katz tells WebMD. \"The study highlights the potential health benefits of statins and NSAIDs in prostate cancer survivors,\" he says. Katz was a member of the team that reported last year that men with prostate cancer who receive high-dose radiation treatment and take statin drugs have a 10% higher chance of being cured of their cancer in the 10 years after diagnosis, compared with those who don't take these medications. While the studies were not designed to examine how statins might protect cancer patients, other research has suggested that statin drugs keep prostate cancer cells from growing in the test tube. But several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent.Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer?Observational studies in which men who don't have prostate cancer are asked about their use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and then followed to see whether they develop prostate cancer suggest that these drugs might help prevent prostate cancer—but the benefit is likely modest and requires long-term regular use. ## Statin Drugs\n\nStatins are prescription drugs that lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke by blocking an enzyme called HMG-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase. Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer? So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent. But several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.The men, ages forty-four to seventy-nine, did not have prostate cancer when the study started in 1990.Ten years later, 2,074 men from the entire study group (those taking statins and those not taking them) had developed prostate cancer.Platz and colleagues found that men who took the cholesterol-lowering drugs had no difference in the risk of early, curable prostate cancer.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In human trials, CP-122,288 was not found to be effective as a treatment for migraine, but its selectivity for neurogenic anti-inflammatory action over vasoconstriction has made it useful for research into the underlying causes of migraine. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine determined that carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/day, but it failed to demonstrate that the drug was sufficiently more effective than placebo in migraine prophylaxis. Triptans such as sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and naratriptan are 5-HT1B receptor agonists that are used to abort migraine and cluster headache attacks. The ergoline antimigraine agent ergotamine also acts on this receptor. Serenics such as batoprazine, eltoprazine, and fluprazine are agonists of the 5-HT1B receptor and other serotonin receptors, and have been found to produce antiaggressive effects in animals, but have not been marketed. Eltoprazine is under development for the treatment of aggression and for other indications. A four-year study of 100 chronic migraine sufferers found that after as few as six 30-minute training sessions, 90% of patients reported significant improvements with their migraines. Lasmiditan, a novel serotonin receptor agonist, was found safe and effective in adults with acute migraine with or without auras and who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease. A phase 3 SAMURAI trial of lasmiditan, a serotonin receptor agonist that targets 5-HT1F receptors without vasoconstriction, found the drug was effective and well tolerated for acute migraine among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The study found that significantly more patients who took lasmiditan (at 100 and 200 mg) were free from headache pain and such symptoms as nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia at two hours after treating a migraine attack. Lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors, including those expressed at the trigeminal pathway, and it has been designed for the acute treatment of migraine without the vasoconstrictor activity associated with some migraine therapies, explained Kraig Kinchen, MD, senior medical director of migraine and related therapeutics at Eli Lilly and Company. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, Dr. Kinchen said. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was published in Neurology on November 16, just two days after Eli Lilly announced its submission of lasmiditan to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults with or without aura. But they also noted that the drug did have other related side effects, which some patients may not find tolerable. The researchers, led by Bernice Kuca, BA, MS, head of clinical and regulatory operations at CoLucid, tracked 1,856 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura who had three to eight migraine attacks per month and moderate disability, as assessed by a Migraine Disability Assessment score greater than or equal to 11. In the 11-week study, the team randomized patients to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and asked patients to treat their next migraine attack within four hours of onset. Patients who received lasmiditan at 200 mg and lasmiditan at 100 mg versus placebo were pain free\n\n Repinotan (BAYx3702), an aminomethylchroman derivative, is a selective 5-HT1A receptor full agonist with high potency and efficacy. It has neuroprotective effects in animal studies,  and was trialed in humans for reducing brain injury following head trauma. It was subsequently trialed up to phase II for treatment of stroke, but while side effects were mild and consisted mainly of nausea, repinotan failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy to justify further clinical trials. Eli Lilly has filed a new migraine drug, lasmiditan, with the US regulator, the first drug in its class to be reviewed as a treatment for the condition. An oral drug, lasmiditan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1F agonist that Lilly says is distinct from other approved migraine therapies and does not cause constriction of blood vessels. The company said it could represent the first significant innovation for the acute treatment of migraine in more than two decades. The filing for lasmiditan includes data from two phase 3 single-attack studies (SAMURAI and SPARTAN), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine. In these studies, patients chose their MBS from sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound or nausea. Emgality, from the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist class, was approved by the FDA for preventive treatment of migraine in adults in September. There are no approved preventive treatments for episodic cluster headache in the US. Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, tiredness, and numbness. A number of triptans have been shown to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D has been made responsible for their anti-migraine activity. The lack of affinity for these receptors might result in fewer side effects related to vasoconstriction compared to triptans in susceptible people, such as those with ischemic heart disease, Raynaud's phenomenon or after a myocardial infarction, although a 1998 review has found such side-effects to rarely occur in people taking triptans. People who cannot follow this advice are advised not to take lasmiditan. It should be used with caution if taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants. SAMURAI compared placebo with 100 and 200 mg doses of lasmiditan. Topline results from the SPARTAN trial showed that the drug induced met its primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. The secondary result showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects were free of their most bothersome symptom (MBS) compared with placebo at two hours following the first dose.

In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. If there is a family history of dairy allergy, then soy infant formula can be considered, but about 10 to 15% of babies allergic to cow's milk will also react to soy. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood.

The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood. In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow's milk.

If there is a cow's-milk allergy, occasionally even a breastfed infant may have colic or eczema until milk and dairy foods are eliminated from the mother's diet. Between 2 and 3 out of every 100 children younger than 3 years have allergy symptoms linked to cow's milk. Vomiting after feeding is the most common way a child shows a milk allergy, but more severe reactions can occur. Colic, crying, and gassiness can sometimes be the only manifestation of cow's-milk allergy in very young infants. Of course the most obvious kind of reaction to milk is when the child drinks milk or eats a milk product and immediately develops breathing problems or hives. Most children with cow's-milk allergy are also allergic to milk from goats or sheep, so these are not good substitutes. Soy-based formula may or may not be suitable for milk-allergic infants because some who are sensitive to cow's milk are also unable to tolerate soy protein. If your cow's-milk-allergic baby does not tolerate soy formula, your pediatrician may recommend a special formula made of extensively hydrolyzed protein or an amino acid elemental formula.

The November 27, 2009 worldwide update by the U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) states that \"more than 207 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 7,820 deaths\". The WHO has also tracked more than 622,482 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1. In late August 2009, the government of Chile discovered that the human H1N1/09 virus had jumped, unmutated, to birds, \"opening a new chapter in the global epidemic\". Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They \n\n On May 22, 2009, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan said the virus must be closely monitored in the southern hemisphere, as it could mix with ordinary seasonal influenza and change in unpredictable ways. Experts writing in the July issue of The New England Journal of Medicine noted that historically, pandemic viruses have evolved between seasons, and the current strain may become more severe or transmissible in the coming months. They therefore stressed the importance of international cooperation to engage in proper surveillance to help monitor changes in the virus's behavior, which will aid in both \"vaccine targeting\" and interpreting illness patterns \n\n mammalian hosts, which is why the disease it causes is called a bird flu. No pandemic strain of H5N1 has yet been found. ... '\" or other cases which are undiagnosed, unreported by national governments to the WHO, or for any reason cannot be confirmed by the WHO. While the \n\nMutations in avian flu could result in rapid spread of new epidemics, with large numbers of deaths. The World Health Organisation has warned repeatedly of the risks to global health from new mutant viruses - of which HIV, SARS virus and Bird Flu virus are just three of many examples we have seen. Just one of these is Bird Flu - caused by virus H5N1. Our world is very open to attack by Bird Flu viruses because we still have no antiviral drugs that are as effective as penicillin and other antibiotics against bacteria. And even if they were, the fact is that 3 billion people live in areas with low health budgets and poorly developed health care systems. It would be impossible to vaccinate the whole world in time, because a Bird Flu pandemic could sweep around the entire globe in a few weeks or months. The H5N1 threat to human health. Based on historical patterns, influenza pandemics can be expected to occur, on average, three to four times each century when new virus subtypes emerge and are readily transmitted from person to person. However, the occurrence of influenza pandemics is unpredictable. In the 20th century, the great influenza pandemic of 1918?1919, which caused an estimated 40 to 50 million deaths worldwide, was followed by pandemics in 1957?1958 and 1968?1969. H5N1 is of particular concern and it is widely held that H5N1 will be cause of the next human pandemic. The epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1, which began in mid-December 2003\n\n and declared the outbreak a pandemic. Image by the CDC. Scientists are warning the public that ‘unpredictable pandemics’ are possible as viruses spread from animals to humans. The warning comes after a woman was diagnosed with the common strain of bird flu, H6N1 and after an article in The Lancet that talked about a need for “intensive” monitoring of bird flu. Are we monitoring for these potential pandemics? An article published in The Lancet entitled, “Human infection with avian influenza A H6N1 virus: an epidemiological analysis” discusses the human infection of H6N1. No one knows when a pandemic will occur or what virus it may be; however, there has been quite the concern over the avian influenza. Experts are also watching the H7N9 virus as a potential to becoming a pandemic. Image by the CDC. There are 16 different avian flu types, but the one that is of the most concern is H5N1. Other strains like the H7N9 is also becoming a concern. According to the WHO, as of October 25, 2013 there have been a total of 137 cases and 45 deaths.

Human infection with avian influenza A H6N1 virus: an epidemiological analysis. The first human case of illness from highly pathogenic avian influenza was identified in 1997. Human infection with avian influenza is rare (the incidence has been that over 700 human infections have occurred with Asian H5N1 virus, according to the World Health Organization [WHO], in mainly 15 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific Islands, and in the near East) but frequently fatal. According to statistics published by the WHO in 2015 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2016, mortality (death) rates from infection with Asian H5N1 have been approximately 60%. Government officials in China announced they detected a new strain of bird flu in March 2013. The last pandemic involving humans was with an influenza virus, H1N1 (often termed the \"swine flu\"), that occurred in 2009. Epidemics may lead to pandemics; there have been several bird flu\n\n located in the nose and throat but H1N1/09 can also infect cells with receptor type a2-3. It is epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to \"bird flu\" and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008, in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006, and 55 in June 2007. As of May 2020, the WHO reported a total of 861 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 455 people since 2003. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives.

Most visualization techniques are used in research, they are not widely available to most patients, have significant technical limitations, have not been widely accepted and generally are not covered by medical insurance carriers. From human clinical trials, it has become increasingly evident \n\n patients and 3.2 million patients have drawn attention to high cumulative doses of more than 100 mSv to patients undergoing recurrent CT scans within a short time span of 1 to 5 years. This creates an important issue of cancer risk to these patients. The subject receives an intravenous injection of radiocontrast, and then the heart is scanned using a high-speed CT scanner, allowing radiologists to assess the extent of occlusion in the coronary arteries, usually to diagnose coronary artery disease. Specifically, it looks for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries that can narrow arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack. The conference highlighted recent advances in the treatment, management, and prevention of cardiovascular diseases with presentations focusing on novel drugs and surgical approaches to improve quality of care for patients. In one study, Serena Day, M.D., of The Ohio State University in Columbus, and colleagues reported a 436 percent increase in hospital admissions at one medical center between 2012 and 2017 for infective endocarditis related to intravenous drug use. Robert Avram, M.D., of the University of California in San Francisco, and colleagues demonstrated that a smartphone application that measures heart rate using a phone’s camera may help detect vascular changes tied to diabetes. The investigators found that the model correctly identified people suffering from diabetes in more than 72 percent of the cases (sensitivity) using the PPG signal alone. THURSDAY, March 21, 2019 — Only a small proportion of recommendations in major cardiovascular society guidelines are supported by evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or a single large RCT, according to a study published in the March 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. WEDNESDAY, March 20, 2019 — For patients with atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation\n\nThe American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. Therefore, it's about 60% likely that you will have some coronary calcification but until the score is determined, the overall predictive significance is nothing more than guesswork. Can the abnormal coronary calcium score be treated? However, a study of 1,005 patients with an abnormal coronary calcium score were treated with aspirin and some with a statin to lower their cholesterol. After four years of treatment, follow-up patients who received a statin had a 7% rate of heart events, such as a heart attack, versus 12% of those which received a placebo. There need to be more studies geared towards determining how the risk can be lowered by specific treatments; however, this study gives a glimpse of the power of finding and treating silent heart disease an early stage. The American College of Cardiology, of which I am a member and Fellow, took a big step forward in 2011 when they commented on coronary calcium CT scans. They released new guidelines for assessment of CV risk in asymptomatic adults. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. \"Because the number of US adults with an intermediate FRS and/or diabetes is substantial, these guidelines mean that many persons should have coronary CT calcium scanning.## \"Bulletproof Your Heart\" Summary\n\n  1.Silent dangerous plaque in heart arteries is almost always calcified\n  2.CT scanners can detect and measure this silent killer in seconds\n  3. In emergency situations, echocardiography is quick, easily accessible, and able to be performed at the bedside, making it the modality of choice for many physicians. Guidelines for treating healthy adults with cholesterol lowering statins “evidence based medicine”? The 2001 guidelines were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. As fate would have it, the findings of a major government-sponsored trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT) were completed and published in JAMA in 2002. “The study found that quadrupling the number of people on statins prevented no more heart disease, nor did it decrease the overall risk of death. The only group that derived any significant benefit from more statins were African Americans, who had fewer episodes of heart disease, but no fewer deaths. Presentation of the ALLHAT findings was delayed; the findings were not presented at the November 2002 meeting of the American Heart Association. The lack of adherence to recommended high-intensity statin therapy is short-sighted, suggested study lead author Dr. Robert Rosenson. \"The message is that the benefits of statins continue to accrue over time,\" said Rosenson, a professor of cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Rosenson explained that these drugs reduce the future risk of heart attack and stroke and lower patients' risk of dying prematurely. But, for people who've already had a heart attack, the goal of statin therapy is to reduce inflammation throughout the body and blood vessels and improve the stability of plaque to prevent future heart problems, Rosenson said. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association jointly issued new treatment guidelines in 2013 recommending that people 75 and younger with heart disease take high-intensity statins. With high-intensity therapy, doctors prescribe more powerful statin drugs at higher doses than those typically given to patients to lower their \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. He wasn't surprised that heart patients aren't taking these medicines as recommended. \"A lot of doctors were not using quite as high of doses before those recommendations came out,\" he said. In addition, many patients taking statins complain about muscle pain. \"As soon as the patient gets aches and pains, either they or their doctor will reduce the dose or stop the drug,\" Pearle said. What's more, getting patients to comply with long-term medication regimens of all types, including statin therapy, remains a challenge, he added. Once the initial teachable moment of a heart attack \"wears off,\" patients are less inclined to stick with their medication regimen a year later. \"The doctor needs to be kind of firm on it because people don't like to take medications.\" Rosenson said cost may have played a small role in patients' poor adherence to recommended treatment, although these medicines are now available as generics. Some of the problems associated with overtesting include patients receiving invasive procedures, overutilizing medical services, getting unnecessary radiation exposure, and experiencing misdiagnosis. In such cases, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans because research shows that the risk of getting such procedures outweighs the possible benefits. Some of the problems associated with overtesting include patients receiving invasive procedures, overutilizing medical services, getting unnecessary radiation exposure, and experiencing misdiagnosis. Correct staging is critical because treatment (particularly the need for pre-operative therapy and/or for adjuvant treatment, the extent of surgery) is generally based on this parameter. Thus, incorrect staging would lead to improper treatment. After her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age 63, Patricia Walters talked to her doctor, Leslie Cho, about how to better monitor her own heart health. Easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening, and covered by most insurance, the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart-attack and stroke risk.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Physical symptoms were quite different (e.g., tachycardia with THC, dilated pupils with LSD), and tolerance to LSD did not cause \n\n and associates published a few studies on THC and marijuana (cannabis). Isbell also investigated dosage effects of THC, and reported that low doses (4–6 mg) produced a pleasurable state (euphoria, perceptual distortion, and change of mood); this dosage was described by subjects as \"good reefer\". According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as of 2015–2016, 19.5% of Washington adults aged 18 or older have used cannabis within the past year, relative to the national average, which was estimated at 13.9% by the same survey. According to Monitoring the Future, between 2010–2012 and 2014–2016, marijuana usage by eighth and 10th graders increased by 2.0% and 4.1% respectively. Synthetic marijuana compounds began to be manufactured and sold in the early 2000s. From 2008 to \n\nThere are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Can I use marijuana and go to work?3.I strongly advise my patients to avoid them.I believe the risk of dabbing and the use of strong concentrates, e.g., shatter and wax, far outweighs their benefit, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood.Careful attention to an individual's mental health history, such as a diagnosis of addiction, depression, anxiety, or a mood disorder, or a family history of addiction, should serve as a warning to the possibility of marijuana being a potential problem. Behavioral support has been effective in treating marijuana addiction. Marijuana potency has steadily increased over the past two decades. THC content increased from 3.7 to 7.5 percent in the early 1990s to 9.6 to 16 percent in 2013. The highest-potency marijuana flower available today contains at most 25 to 30 percent THC. But the concentrates can contain up to 95 percent or more THC. The effect is so intense and the addiction potential so much greater that they have been described as the \"crack cocaine of marijuana.\" Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain (especially the developing brain) are exposed to extremely high concentrations of THC or whether the recent increases in emergency department visits by people testing positive for marijuana are related to rising potency. There are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Each of us is unique and will respond a bit differently to marijuana.As you'll learn in question 5, the marijuana products most effective for relieving pain are not strongly psychoactive, and the effect of the THC in them is mitigated by both CBD and the pain itself. The metabolites leave the stores slowly over a period of weeks, and they can be detected in urine samples to indicate that a person smoked marijuana many days ago.THC distributes throughout the body, with THC metabolites depositing in the fat stores of the body.Marijuana produces a dreamy euphoria, which has qualities similar to that of alcohol or opioid intoxication. \"Street\" jargon includes: blunts (hollowed-out cigars packed with marijuana), colas (buds of the cannabis plant, which are preferred by marijuana users because of their higher content of delta-9-THC, the active ingredient in marijuana), and hashish or hash (the most potent form, which comes from the resin of the cannabis plant when it is separated from the plant material). The major or most potent psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is THC. THC is present in marijuana in concentrations from 2–15%. The source of marijuana determines its THC concentration, depending upon the species, growth environment, part of the plant that is harvested, and where it comes from. However, the greater euphoria of higher-potency marijuana can lead to more marijuana use and abuse, as well as more side effects. The most common route of administration of marijuana is smoking, although some is ingested orally in homemade foods (e.g., brownies) or in a pharmaceutical product known as dronabinol (Marinol). When smoked, THC enters the circulation almost immediately, reaching high blood levels in 5–10 minutes. The metabolites leave the stores slowly over a period of weeks, and they can be detected in urine samples to indicate that a person smoked marijuana many days ago.Although there is a severe shortage of good information about the sociological and long-term effects of marijuana, there is no shortage of information on where THC acts in the brain.A number of studies have isolated the \"cannabinoid receptor\" (CB), which appears to be distributed widely throughout the CNS (Pertwee, 2006). Cannabis users whose first experience with the drug is with potent “skunk” strains are nearly five times more likely to go on to show signs of dependence, US researchers have said. “THC has linearly increased over two decades,” said Dr Brook Arterberry, an assistant professor of psychology at Iowa State University who led this research. In annual follow-ups, users who reported that they had started smoking skunk – with an average THC content of 12.3 per cent – were 4.8 times more likely to have one or more symptoms of cannabis use disorder when compared to those smoking a 4.9 per cent strain. Cannabis is not typically thought of as addictive in the same way as heroin, cocaine, or even alcohol, where withdrawal can have serious physical health effects. The law also expands the state's existing medical marijuana \n\nThe increased potency of marijuana in the USA over the past four decades can be attributed to several factors. One reason is the shift in the source of marijuana supply from foreign to domestic. Growers have learned to manipulate various factors such as lighting, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels to enhance the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in marijuana plants. Changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana also play a role in the perceived increase in potency. Testing artifacts, such as improved testing methods and increased accuracy in measuring THC levels, may contribute to the apparent rise in potency. A study using data from the Potency Monitoring Program found that when adjusting for marijuana quality, the reported increase in THC% between the 1970s and the 2000s is estimated to be about 57-67% as great as initially reported. This suggests that the long-term rise in potency may be slightly overestimated due to data quality issues and the need to account for the quality of the tested marijuana. In conclusion, the increased potency of marijuana in the USA can be attributed to a combination of factors including the shift to domestic cultivation, advancements in cultivation techniques, and changes in testing procedures. ; Jasinski, Haertzen, and Isbell (1971) describe some of the subjective and physiological effects of the synthetic cannabinoids parahexyl and dimethylheptylpyran.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

As it suppressed the rebellion, the Burundian government embarked on a programme of ethnic repression, targeting the country's remaining Hutu elites, including those who had served in government and the military. Ndayahoze disappeared after being summoned to a crisis meeting early in the morning on 30 April. It was later revealed that he had been arrested and executed, making him one of the first Hutu officials to be murdered by the regime during its repression. Burundian officials alleged that under interrogation he admitted to plotting the rebellion against the government with other Hutus. In 1987 the widow of Ndayahoze sought compensation for the murder of her husband and on behalf of other families with members who were victims of the 1972 repression. At the request of the Burundian ambassador, she was barred from the UN headquarters building in New York. She later compiled his writings and published them in a book, Le commandant Martin Ndayahoze, un visionnaire. Pie Ntavyohanyuma is a Burundian politician who was head of the National Assembly from 2007 to 2015. He resigned and fled to Brussels, Belgium on June 28, 2015 during the 2015–2018 Burundian unrest, citing the unrest and his opposition to president Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for a disputed third term in the 2015 Burundian presidential election. He told France 24 that he \"personally advised President Nkurunziza to drop his plan for a third term, but his answer was to threaten me, to humiliate me.\" In September 1987, Bagaza travelled to Quebec, Canada, to attend a francophone summit. The army took over, led by Bagaza's cousin, Major Pierre Buyoya. Hearing of the coup, Bagaza immediately returned to Africa but Bujumbura Airport was closed, and in Nairobi, he was refused entrance to Kenya. Following the coup, Bagaza fled to Uganda, and then in 1989, Libya, where he was granted political asylum. Buyoya formed the Military Committee for National Salvation to take control, suspended the country's constitution and was inaugurated as president on 2 October 1987. Buyoya, a Roman Catholic, said that he would lift measures imposed on the Catholic Church by Bagaza's government. He was succeeded by Melchior Ndadaye following the 1993 presidential election, and came to power in Burundi for a second time following a military coup in 1996, that ousted Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. contacted by a group of Hutu conspirators who informed him of their plan to launch a coup against President Micombero on the night of 16/17 September. Instead of assisting them, Ndayahoze warned Micombero and as a result 70 people were arrested. Thereafter, Micombero heavily relied on him to calm Hutus in Burundi and prevent ethnic revolt. His tenure as Minister of Information ended in December. In May 1970 Ndayahoze was appointed Minister of Economy. Throughout 1971 and 1972 he wrote frequently in his reports to the presidency of the dangers of worsening ethnic relations in Burundi.

His well-preserved and still wrapped mummy does not display any outward signs of a violent death so the cause of death was long assumed to be a natural one. In 2012, Dr Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at Imperial College London, hypothesized that early deaths of Thutmose IV and other 18th Dynasty pharaohs, including Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, were likely a result of familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for the untimely demise of Thutmose IV and could also explain his religious vision described on the Dream Stele as this type of epilepsy is associated with intense spiritual visions and religiosity. The reasons for his relatively early death are uncertain, but there is no evidence of violence on his mummy. His mummy was found decapitated, but this was likely caused after his death by tomb robbers. The Amun priest carefully reattached his head to his body with the use of linen cloths. It has been suggested that he died from a disease which had \n\n January 1907, the coffin and mummy were investigated in situ. In December 2000, a joint team from Waseda University in Japan and Cairo's Ain Shams University tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, but was denied by the Egyptian Government. Hawass stated at the time that DNA analysis was out of the question because it would not lead to anything. In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of Tutankhamun and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture. German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory, suggesting other possible alternatives for Tutankhamun's cause of death. In 2012, a study signed by Hawass disclosed that Ramses III may have had a haplogroup that is associated with the Bantu expansion and is the most dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, E1b1a.<ref name=HawassZinkBMJ12>\n\n Saleem uses medical imaging, in particular CT scans, to study mummies. She is part of the Egyptian Mummy Project and she has scanned several of the royal mummies, including Hatshepsut, Thutmose III and Seti I, from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. By using CT scans on the mummy of Tutankhamun, Saleem and Hawass determined that he was around 19 years old when he was mummified. They also scanned Ramesses III, a pharaoh who was thought to be the victim of a harem conspiracy. Scans performed by Saleem revealed that Ramesses throat was cut and his left toe was cut off, providing supporting evidence that he was likely killed in that conspiracy, as the injuries pointed to there being more than one attacker. From September 2007 to October 2009, eleven royal mummies of the New Kingdom's 18th Dynasty underwent extensive genetic and radiological testing. A team of doctors, under the leadership of Dr. Zahi Hawass, took DNA samples from bone tissue of the eleven mummies to determine a family pedigree and to determine if any familial or pathological diseases caused Tutankhamun's death. It was discovered that Tutankhamun's family had a large number of irregularities. Four of the mummies, including Tutankhamun, were shown to have had malaria. Based on all the data, the study concluded the most likely cause of death for the young king was the combination of avascular necrosis, malaria and a leg fracture. The presence of 130 canes in the tomb was used as evidence to support Hawass's claim that Tutankhamun suffered from a walking impairment.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

One can petition for assisted outpatient treatment along with, or instead of, hospitalization. In Nevada, prior to confining someone, the state must demonstrate that the person \"is mentally ill and, because of that illness, is likely to harm himself or others if allowed his liberty.\" In Oregon, the standard that the allegedly mentally ill person \"Peter [h]as been committed and hospitalized twice in the last three years, is showing symptoms or behavior similar to those that preceded and led to a prior hospitalization and, unless treated, will continue, to a reasonable medical probability, \n\n In Arizona, the government can mandate inpatient treatment for anyone determined to be \"persistently or acutely disabled.\" In Connecticut, someone can be committed only if he or she has \"psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled\". In Texas, the standard is that, in the judgment of the person seeking involuntary commitment, 1) the person is mentally ill, and 2) because of that mental illness \"there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person or to others unless the person is immediately restrained\". The Utah standard is that the proposed patient has a mental illness that poses a substantial danger. In Wisconsin, the District II Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that patients with Alzheimer's disease cannot be involuntary committed under Chapter 51 and can only be involuntarily committed for residential care and custody under Chapter 55. he led the effort to do a 1332 waiver to reduce health care costs. On prescription drug relief, Feltes authored the historic legislation to import safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada for New Hampshire seniors.

Section 1115 demonstration waivers for serious mental illness (SMI) and serious emotional disturbance (SED). Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in November 2018 allows states to pay for short-term psychiatric care for adults in IMD settings. In addition, states may also seek Medicaid payment for services provided to individuals 21 years of age or younger in settings that do not meet CMS requirements to qualify for the inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 benefit (commonly referred to as the psych under 21 benefit). In order to receive demonstration approval, states must meet several criteria, including providing access to a continuum of mental health services, use of a utilization review entity, and certain provider requirements. Section 1115 SUD demonstration waivers. CMS guidance issued in November 2017 outlines the parameters for states to obtain a Section 1115 waiver to pay for short-term residential SUD treatment in IMDs. Among other things, criteria address coverage of certain outpatient and residential services, provider requirements, and evaluation and reporting milestones. 115-271) created a new state plan option to allow states to pay for care for Medicaid beneficiaries age 21–64 with at least one SUD in certain IMDs. In order for a state to receive state plan approval, several requirements must be meant including coverage of outpatient, residential, and inpatient services, as well as maintenance of effort requirements. Current Medicaid regulations indicate when managed care organizations (MCOs) can pay for treatment in IMDs as an in-lieu of service. Medicaid payment for IMD services under this authority is limited to 15 days per month. State Medicaid programs are statutorily required to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries and other low income patients. States can make DSH payments for uncompensated care costs at IMDs as long as such payments do not exceed the lesser amount of the amount of DSH funds that the state paid IMDs in fiscal year (FY) 1995 or 33 percent of the state’s FY 1995 DSH allotment for all hospitals. Maine made DSH payments exclusively to IMDs and four states\n\n 2% of income. In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. of testing in nursing homes, which drove New Hampshire to becoming the worst in-the-nation in dealing with COVID in nursing homes. Feltes fought for additional support and enhanced oversight and transparency of nursing homes, including the New Hampshire Veterans Home, advocated for a COVID-19 Workers Bill of Rights to get people back to work safely, and Feltes was among the first in the nation to propose direct relief for frontline workers. In a sweeping reform of children's mental health care, Feltes authored the bipartisan landmark legislation making the largest advancement in children’s mental health care in the history of New Hampshire, including a statewide system \n\nSerious mental illnesses disrupt people’s ability to carry out essential aspects of daily life, such as self care and household management. In addition, half of the mentally ill homeless population in the United States also suffers from substance abuse and dependence (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). This combination of mental illness, substance abuse, and poor physical health makes it very difficult for people to obtain employment and residential stability. In a survey by the United States Conference of Mayors (2008), 20% of cities listed better coordination with mental health service providers as one of the top three items needed to combat homelessness. Funding\n\nWhat is a Crisis Resolution Center? Treatment is intended to keep the person safe, stabilize the person’s acute psychiatric symptoms, and return the person to their familiar living situation and treatment as soon as possible. In Oregon, a facility for up to five residents is licensed as a Residential Treatment Home (OAR 309-035-0250). Facilities of six beds or more require licensing as a Residential Treatment Facility (OAR 309-035-0100). These facilities are commonly limited to 16 residents, as this is the maximum number of residents permitted to still qualify for Medicaid reimbursement. The State of Oregon has rules for different “Classes” of facilities (OAR 309-033-0520) based on the level of restriction permitted on the person’s freedom of movement. Class 3 facilities are not locked; admission and discharge are voluntary on the part of the person, and the person must be released upon the person’s request (unless this presents a danger to themselves or others, at which time other legal means must be utilized). Crisis respite stays in Oregon are limited to 30 days by OAR.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished. Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013.\n\n to Geron. Imetelstat is currently in two Phase 3 trials: NCT02598661, a study of the drug’s ability to reduce the transfusion requirements of patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and NCT04576156, an investigation of the drug’s effect on the overall survival of patients suffering from myelofibrosis. ; A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with prostate cancer was carried out at Duke University. Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck. ; GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of paclitaxel, was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012. Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several potential anti-cancer products. As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released. In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO at the time was Geron founder Michael D. West, acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron and later went on to restart the trial.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was approved in 2000 for the treatment of pediatric leukemia on the basis of limited data, but it was withdrawn from the market in 2010 after confirmatory trials initiated in 2004 showed increased mortality and no efficacy.42 p.1258: 42. Food and Drug Administration. Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin): market withdrawal. WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., May 2, 2014 – Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada (NYSE: MRK), and Endocyte, Inc. (NASDAQ: ECYT), today announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the PROCEED trial has completed a pre specified, interim futility analysis and the DSMB recommended that the trial be stopped because vintafolide did not demonstrate efficacy on the pre-specified outcome of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The DSMB did not identify any safety concerns for the patients enrolled in the trial. Based on the DSMB recommendation and while further review of the data are conducted, the Companies have taken steps to notify investigators that screening and randomization of participants in the trial will be suspended. PROCEED is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind clinical trial, evaluating vintafolide in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared to PLD plus placebo for the treatment of folate receptor-positive, platinum-resistant, ovarian cancer. The DSMB evaluated the results of a formal pre-planned interim efficacy analysis in order to assess the efficacy of the injection in the femoral head of 20 million autologous PREOB cells combined with core decompression vs. the injection of placebo combined with core decompression, with the intent to stop the study early if there is overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit or futility. The DSMB reported that PREOB was well-tolerated by patients. However, the interim results suggest that it is unlikely that the primary objective will be achieved at the final analysis. The DSMB therefore recommended the discontinuation of the trial. Based on this recommendation, and while the data is being reviewed, the Company is taking steps to notify investigators that enrolment of patients in the trial is being stopped. The discontinuation of the Phase III hip osteonecrosis study does not affect the clinical development of the allogeneic platform, ALLOB, in other promising indications, with different physiopathology, larger patient populations and faster clinical trial recruitment than in osteonecrosis of the hip. As announced recently, the ALLOB platform has further advantages over PREOB including dosing, logistics and scalability, offering substantial advantages in reaching large patient populations in a cost-effective manner. The Company believes it is therefore more economically viable than the autologous product. Efficacy and safety data for the full set of 32 patients are expected mid-2019, post a follow-up period of 12 months. The Company believes the favorable safety and efficacy profile of JTA-004 observed\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health has stopped enrollment into a clinical trial testing the effects of highly concentrated (hypertonic) saline solutions on patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) when given as soon as possible after the injury — that is, before the patient arrives at the hospital or emergency room. Previously enrolled participants who have not yet completed their six month follow-up visits will continue to be monitored according to the study design. The TBI trial tests whether the hypertonic solutions improve brain function in severely injured patients as measured 6 months after injury, compared to usual care with normal saline. A detailed DSM plan must be submitted to and approved by NIDA before the trial begins. It includes medications, herbal/nutritional supplements, physical interventions, behavioral interventions, prevention trials, and/or diagnostic tools that affect the outcome of the study participants.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Some of the symptoms that COVID-19 patients could experience is shortness of breath (which might be a sign of pneumonia), cough, fever, and diarrhea. The three most recorded and common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and coughing, as reported by the World Health Organization. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. However, people transferred to \n\nSome common respiratory viruses include RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), influenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. RSV is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. It can lead to a range of respiratory symptoms including cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, body aches, and fatigue. Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold. It typically causes symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and mild coughing. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, and muscle pain. They often present with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, runny nose, coughing, and pink eye. Parainfluenza viruses are another common cause of respiratory infections in both children and adults. It's important to note that diagnosis for these respiratory viruses may involve techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or chest X-rays (CXR) to confirm the presence of the virus or assess any related complications. Overall, understanding the characteristics of these common respiratory viruses can help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage respiratory infections. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed. One common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose. There is no vaccine for the common cold. The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. These infections have existed throughout human history. Signs and symptoms The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. The color of the mucus or nasal secretion may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection. Progression A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Since the early 2000s, CSPI has worked with policymakers and advocates in Philadelphia, New York City, California, and numerous other jurisdictions to pass laws to list calories on menus and menu boards. In addition to making calorie information available to consumers, a key benefit of menu labeling has been the reformulation of existing food items and the introduction of nutritionally improved items in many chain restaurants. In 2010, CSPI successfully lobbied for a provision, which was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act, to require calorie labeling on menus at chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments nationwide. The FDA proposed regulations for menu labeling in 2011, and CSPI has since worked to continue to mobilize support for national menu labeling, diffuse opposition from Congress and special interests, and encourage the FDA to strengthen the final regulations and release them in a timely manner.

It was sold to hometown bank KeyCorp in 1998, but was eventually sold to the U.S. investment arm of Swiss banking giant UBS AG in 2007. South Carolina and Texas have already reached settlements with J&J in their lawsuits. Corporate Accountability International (CAI), a group that challenges corporate abuses, posted an open letter on its website asking hospitals that house McDonalds restaurants to end their contracts with the fast food chain to “stop fostering a food environment that promotes harm, not health.” The letter points out that the rates at which children suffer from diet-related illnesses like diabetes are “staggering,” and the problem is related in part to the consumption of junk food. Locating McDonalds stores in hospitals is part of a marketing strategy, CAI says, that is aimed at imparting an aura of healthfulness to the food — a goal that is inconsistent with the goals of a health institution. But these efforts cannot compete with the profit-driven mechanisms by which McDonalds and the fast food industry operate their business, and the toll that McDonalds’ practices have had on children’s health,” the letter states. CAI’s petition to get McDonalds out of hospitals is here. Kraft Foods, Coke, Pepsi, Intuit and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have all pulled their support of the controversial corporate bill mill the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The Gradison name, which lasted for 80 years, was acquired in October 1991 for $22.63 million. Gradison & Co. was founded in 1925. Since 1991, the principal offices were located at 800 Superior Avenue in downtown Cleveland, known as the McDonald Investment Center. It was formed in 1924 by Charles Bert \"Bert\" McDonald and James Callahan, who borrowed $50,000 to buy the Geo. The pair would rename the firm McDonald & Callahan. The firm would use several more names before settling on McDonald & Co. in 1944. In 1964, McD bought Field, Richards & Co. McD was organized as a partnership until it went public on July 20, 1983.

While medications may increase renal clearance, many patients with severe illness have higher clearance prior to the initiation of these medications. Augmented renal clearance also may occur in people who have some types of cancers, such as hematologic cancers. In these people, the efficacy of antibiotic treatment may be decreased if the increased clearance is not accounted for. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. ; Anesthesia: General anesthetics during surgery may cause bladder atony by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant.

For the study, Casadei and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,900 patients who were having elective heart surgery to take Crestor or a placebo before surgery. The researchers found that patients given Crestor had lower levels of cholesterol and C-reactive protein (another marker for heart trouble) after surgery, compared with patients given a placebo. And further analyses showed that Crestor was associated with a 5.4 percent greater chance of mild kidney damage, when compared with a placebo. \"The risk of kidney injury is relatively small, but considering that the benefit of statin treatment before a heart operation is zero, one may well consider stopping statins for a few days before surgery,\" Casadei said. The report was published May 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the study findings should not deter patients from taking statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes. \"Current guidelines recommend that all patients with cardiovascular disease, including patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, receive statins to lower the risk of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Beyond the intermediate and long-term benefits of statins, a number of small clinical trials have suggested an additional short-term benefit of starting or continuing statin therapy before heart surgery. According to the FDA, caution is required to consider prior use of OSP, especially in patients with the following potential risk factors. The risk of acquiring phosphate nephropathy was reported to increase in parallel with the number of these listed risk factors. This renal insufficiency is associated with the use of oral sodium phosphate (OSP) such as C.B. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the potential risk factors of this complication are pre-existing kidney disease, increased age, female gender, dehydration, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,...concurrent treatment with hypertensive medications (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) and medications that affect renal perfusion (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAIDs and diuretics). Phosphate nephropathy may also \n\nTaking statins in high doses increases the risk of emergency hospital treatment for kidney damage, warn researchers. They found patients taking high potency statins had a 34 per cent higher risk of being hospitalised for acute kidney injury, compared with those taking low doses. Those in the high-risk group were taking 40 milligram and higher statin pills. The health records of two million people were used from the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies for those with and without chronic kidney disease. High potency statin users were 34 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with low potency statin users in the first 120 days of treatment. Rates were not significantly increased in patients with chronic kidney disease. This risk seemed to remain elevated for two years after starting treatment. The researchers estimate that 1,700 patients with no previous kidney problems need to be treated with a high potency statin instead of a low potency statin in order to cause one additional hospitalisation. But the risk could have been ‘underestimated’ they say in a report in the online medical journal bmj.com. The researchers conclude that prescribing high potency statins is ‘associated with an increased rate of hospital admission with AKI compared with lower potency statins’. The risk of type 2 diabetes is raised by 12 per cent with high dose statins compared with moderate doses, according to a study. Lead researcher Professor Colin Dormuth, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said further investigation was necessary to determine how statins might be causing kidney injury. It could be due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, or because use\n\nCholesterol is essential for the functioning of all human organs. In animal models statins have been shown to decrease the size of gallstones. The evidence concerning the association between statins and the risk of acute pancreatitis is inconclusive. Findings in case reports and two case–control studies have suggested that statins increase the risk of acute pancreatitis, whereas a recent meta-analysis suggested a protective association. To investigate the relationship of statins and pancreatitis, we carried out two studies in Kuopio University Hospital (461 admissions of patients with AP and 1140 patients with gallstones between 2008 - 2010) including patient cohort during (272 statin users and 272 controls). In patients with cholecystectomy there was no significant difference in outcome between the statin users and non-users, although statin users had more polypharmacy (including drugs that cause bleeding) and cardiovascular illnesses than non-users. The mean operation time for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 10% shorter for the patients with statin use than for the patients without. Together with the Finnish Medicine Agency (Fimea) we carried out a large nationwide study and found that statin use was associated with an increased incidence of AP (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). The incidence was elevated especially during the first year of use both among current and former statin users. Interestingly, the patients using lipid-lowering drugs had gallbladder stones in surgery less frequently than those without statins. In the late 1990s it introduced a statin drug, Baycol (cerivastatin), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to \n\n Some cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins, cytotoxins, endotoxins, and hepatotoxins (e.g., the microcystin-producing bacteria genus microcystis), which are collectively known as cyanotoxins. This results in algal blooms which can become harmful to other species and pose a danger to humans and animals if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. For this reason blooms of cyanobacteria seldom occur in rivers unless the water is flowing slowly. Growth is also favoured at higher temperatures which enable Microcystis species to outcompete diatoms and green algae, and potentially allow \n\nWhat kind of diseases can your dog get from swimming in lakes, streams, ponds, or rivers? It poses a significant health risk to both dogs and humans who come into contact with it, and may lead to fever, lethargy, vomit­ing, kidney failure, liver failure, and even death in some untreated individu­als. Blue-green algae may be found in fresh or brackish waters and often appears as either foam, scum, or mats of red, green, or brown algae. Water contami­nated with this organism may smell musty or foul and should definitely be avoided. If your dog’s fur becomes contaminated by this algae, it should be washed thoroughly. Consider boiling drinking water for both yourself and your dog if backpacking with your furry compan­ion in areas known to have high levels of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, or other infectious organisms. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are one of the common causes of water pollution. They can cause cyanobacteria poisoning or cyanide poisoning. Cyanobacteria produce toxins called cyanotoxins, which can contaminate water bodies and pose a threat to humans, animals, and marine life. It's important to note that cyanobacteria poisoning is just one type of water pollution-related poisoning. Each type of poisoning has its own set of symptoms and health consequences. In Victoria, Australia, 17 sheep died and many others showed signs of light sensitivity after drinking from a lake affected by a thick bloom of M. aeruginosa.In the USA, a colourless alga is reported to have caused dysentery, blindness and deafness, and sometimes ataxia and head-tilting.Poisoning by algae has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea off Denmark.Nalila salina (originally from Lake Uroumich, northern Iran) is rich (12 per cent of dry matter) in natural carotenoids. ## Algae Poisoning\n\nToxic freshwater algae, characteristically blue-green in colour, are found in summer on lakes in numerous locations, particularly where water has a high phosphate and nitrate content derived from farm land. The main toxic freshwater cyanobacteria are strains of the unicellular Microcystis aeruginosa, and the filamentous forms Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon and Oscillatoria agardhii. Poisoning by algae has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea off Denmark. In Victoria, Australia, 17 sheep died and many others showed signs of light sensitivity after drinking from a lake affected by a thick bloom of M. aeruginosa.Poisoning in cattle was suspected in the UK after a spell of hot weather in East Anglia caused an algal bloom in field ponds and 50 per cent of the cows in a herd suddenly showed nervous signs.BSE was ruled out as the cause.## Alimentary Canal\n\n(See DIGESTION, ABSORPTION AND ASSIMILATION. Aquatic cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible blooms that can form in both freshwater and marine environments. The blooms can have the appearance of blue-green \n\nCyanobacteria poisoning, also known as blue-green algae poisoning, refers to the toxic effects caused by the ingestion or inhalation of cyanobacteria, particularly from contaminated water sources. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that can produce toxins under certain conditions. These toxins can pose a risk to human and animal health. Symptoms of cyanobacteria poisoning can vary depending on the specific toxins produced and the amount ingested. Additionally, exposure to cyanobacteria toxins can cause skin rashes, respiratory irritation, and allergic reactions. Cyanobacteria blooms typically occur in bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, that have high levels of nutrients and warm temperatures. To prevent cyanobacteria poisoning, it is important to avoid exposure to potentially contaminated water sources. This includes avoiding swimming or recreating in water bodies with visible cyanobacteria blooms or scum. It is also advised to not use untreated water for drinking, cooking, or any other purpose if cyanobacteria blooms are present or suspected. Water treatment methods, such as filtration and disinfection, can be effective in removing or inactivating cyanobacteria and their toxins. If you suspect cyanobacteria poisoning after exposure to contaminated water, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately. Algae poisoning has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea and in cattle, sheep, and dogs that have consumed water affected by toxic freshwater algae. The specific signs and symptoms can vary depending on the dominant cyanobacterium present. For example, some cyanobacteria can produce alkaloid neuromuscular toxins, which can lead to muscular tremors, stupor, prostration, convulsions, and even death. Other cyanobacteria may produce a slower-acting peptide toxin, resulting in symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, thirst, piloerection, lachrymation, and light sensitization with inflamed white skin and edema of the ears and eyelids. It is important to be aware of the potential effects of algae poisoning on animals and take necessary precautions to prevent their exposure. The trumpet shell Charonia sauliae has been implicated in food poisonings, and evidence suggests it contains a tetrodotoxin derivative. In 2009, a major scare in the Auckland Region of New Zealand was sparked after several dogs died eating Pleurobranchaea maculata (grey side-gilled seaslug) on beaches.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Every year, nearly five million Americans need blood transfusions, while an estimated 43,000 pints of donated blood are used each day. This country has a severe blood shortage. Donating blood is perfectly safe, with no risk of contracting any blood-borne diseases. The U.S. blood supply is very safe, with little chance of diseases like HIV being transmitted via blood transfusion. People with this type of blood are known as \"universal donors.\" Every year, nearly five million Americans need blood transfusions, and an estimated 43,000 of donated blood are used each day in the United States. Yet the country's blood supply runs on perilously thin margins. Several reasons: The World War II generation, which has always been the greatest donor of blood products, is getting older and fewer. Subsequent generations simply haven't taken up the call to donate. You cannot donate if you have ever tested positive for HIV or Hepatitis B or C or have a clotting disorder or have taken human pituitary-derived growth hormone. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a de facto ban. In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019.

MONDAY, March 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A simple blood test appeared to detect signs of concussion up a week after patients suffered a head injury, researchers report. The test might provide a new way to diagnose concussions, especially in patients without immediate symptoms, the researchers said. \"This [blood test] could provide doctors with an important tool for simply and accurately diagnosing those patients, particularly children, and making sure they are treated properly,\" she added in a news release from the Florida health care provider. The test looks for a biomarker called glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is released into the bloodstream when the brain is injured. In nearly 600 patients age 18 and older, the blood test detected mild to moderate concussion with up to 97 percent accuracy, the researchers said. \"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa, a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded researcher. The test could also help to identify patients who need neurosurgery and could significantly reduce the use of CT scans to diagnose concussions, according to the study published online March 28 in the journal JAMA Neurology. An estimated 250,000 U.S. children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports -- nearly 700 a day. As a result, it can be difficult for doctors to determine the severity of the injury, Papa said. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. Studies suggest that \n\n Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination by lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap), brain imaging studies, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological testing and similar diagnostic studies may be used to differentiate the various causes of encephalopathy.

Researchers believe that a blood test may be helpful in determining whether a child has sustained a concussion, as well as determining ithe severity of the problem. A new study found that a blood test correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) 94 percent of the time. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. During the study, researchers performed CT scans on 152 children in the study while comparing the results of the scans with results from the blood tests. While the CT scans helped to identify which patients suffered visible TBIs, the blood test also detected the symptoms of concussions even when the brain injuries were not visible on CT scans. As it stands, most children with concussions are diagnosed by symptoms alone. Typically, these are observed via vomitting or balance problems or can be reported by the child through headache, blurred vision or feeling groggy. However, these do not really give doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury. \"You really want to minimize the amount of CTs you do to your patients, especially children, who are a lot more sensitive to radiation and the side effects that can come with it.\" Is There A Link Between Traumatic Brain Injury and Road Rage?\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This chemical conversion may be why pets that have been sprayed by skunks will have a faint \"skunky\" odor on damp evenings. Spotted skunks can spray up to roughly 10 feet. Rabies control is provided by law in KRS 258.005-258.990 and under the state Communicable Disease Regulation 902KAR 2:070. What is rabies and how do people get it? In 1999, skunks accounted for 21 of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky. People get rabies from the bite of an infected, or rabid, animal. Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. In some areas your animal control personnel will be involved in the investigation of the incident, including efforts to find the animal. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Confine your pet or otherwise make sure it does not run away. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, or ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to do this, the animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month before being released. Dogs, cats and ferrets with current rabies vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian should be revaccinated immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a\n\n occur. In December 2012, an eight-year-old boy was scratched by a bat in north Queensland. But he said only two cases have ever been recorded, both in Queensland. No \n\nRecently the Toronto Public Health Services received confirmation of this year’s first positive rabid bat in Hamilton. I am writing this blog regarding rabies in bats, raccoons and other wildlife so you will know what prevention steps to take, learn about the symptoms, steps to take if you are bitten and not to panic! In Canada, common carriers of rabies are bats, raccoon, skunk and foxes. Recently the most human-rabies cases have been contracted by rabies in bats. The virus lives in the saliva of the rabid animal and is contracted by a bite, through an open cut or wound, or if the virus gets near your mouth nose or eyes. There are several strains presently in Ontario, there are skunk and fox strains, raccoon strains and bats have several strains. If you get bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, seek treatment immediately from a local physician or hospital. There are several strains in Ontario, to control this the Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) distributes baits for wildlife to eat each year. The bait contains a rabies vaccine that is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Be sure to take the proper precautions when around bats. An animal that has contracted rabies will have flu-like symptoms, severe headache, and fever. In humans early symptoms is numbness or itchiness around the bite area, flu like symptoms and headache progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. Raccoons can pick up various strains of rabies, but they are most susceptible to the raccoon strain. Raccoons are generally a nocturnal animal, so if you spot a raccoon exhibiting abnormal behaviour especially in the day, be alert and keep your distance. As a precaution, all bites or scratches by raccoons should be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus. Raccoons may incubate rabies for long periods (months) without becoming ill. The present raccoon rabies epidemic was first confirmed in the Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern states in 1977, and has continued to spread to other states. Hundreds of animal bites are reported in Wayne County each year. Any warm-blooded animal can contract the illness; however, typical wildlife rabies is spread by raccoons, skunks, bats, and fox. In past few years several rabid animals (all bats) have been found in Wayne County. Infected wild animals can pass rabies to pets. Animals which are very rarely affected are rats, mice, squirrels, hamsters, and rabbits. Fortunately, few human cases of rabies are reported (1 case in Ohio since 1970 and 32 cases in the U.S. since 1980). How do I know an Animal is Rabid? Un-vaccinated or stray domestic animals are still the greatest threat to humans. Animals who exhibit unusual or abnormal behavior should be considered a risk. Rabid animals may stagger, appear restless, change the tone of their bark or growl, appear to be choking, or become excitable/irritable or aggressive. If bitten or scratched, see your doctor and report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District. Report contacts between your pets and wild animals to your veterinarian. If it can be done safely, try to detain or hold the animal, so it can be quarantined/tested for rabies. Report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District and provide the following information using this Bite Report Form. Yet rabies is still around, present in many mammals, including raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes, and contact with any infected animal can mean infection for you or an unvaccinated furry pet. To make people more aware of the continued threat and precautions to take, national and international health organizations have designated September 28, 2011, as World Rabies Day. Vaccination could reduce or eliminate this risk, and a goal of the World Rabies Day campaign is to ensure more widespread vaccination of dogs. Remember,\n\nWELD COUNTY, Colo. — In recent months, five skunks have tested positive for rabies near the Colorado towns of Severance, Pierce, and Grover. Some animal and human exposures have occurred, and they all are receiving treatment. Four people are receiving post exposure prophylaxis after handling their pets which encountered the skunks. A total of 14 dogs were also exposed. Health officials continue to educate the public about preventing rabies exposure. \"Rabies can infect any mammal,\" said Mark E. Wallace, MD, MPH, executive director of the Weld County Health Department. In past years, domestic bison and horses have contracted rabies, in addition to a variety of wildlife. \"The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated. If you are in direct contact with a rabid animal, such as a skunk or bat, your risk is much higher,\" Wallace said. Rabies can infect many wild animals, including skunks, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and bats. Health officials recommend all domestic animals such as cats, dogs, horses and livestock be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches) is their prime purpose. Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs).

Selective toxicity, controlled application, and \n\n Boars can be damaging to agriculture in situations where their natural habitat is sparse. ; Determine whether shooting at night is safe with reference to the general public, pets, and livestock A DEFRA statement, published in October 2012, stated, \"The aim of this monitoring is to test the assumption that controlled shooting is a humane culling technique.\" The statement makes no indication that the cull would assess the effectiveness of reducing bTB in the trial areas. To reduce the risk of their animals being infected with this disease, farmers used to shoot desert warthogs. Therefore, only 1.1% of badgers killed by free shooting were tested for humaneness of shooting. Details of the ongoing pilot culls were not released whilst they were being conducted, and DEFRA declined to divulge how the success of the trials would be measured. Harvesting 66% of the total population per year is required to keep the Texas feral pig populations stable. Best management practices suggest the use of corral traps which have the ability to capture the entire sounder of feral pigs. The federal government spends $20 million on feral pig management. In February 2017, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller approved the use of a pesticide called Kaput Feral Hog Lure, which is bait food laced with warfarin (a rodenticide used to kill rodents). On 27 March, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported the symptoms described in affected animals are not \"fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin.\" Although the lab claimed to have no explanation of what happened, it was discovered that a technician had handled the animal the previous day, and a necropsy suggested that the injury occurred on that day. The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) worked in concert with the USDA to identify and eliminate feral swine populations which harbored the ASF virus in Haiti. SCWDS enlisted the use of American and Haitian hog-hunting dogs to reduce the populations.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Studies show an increased risk of cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction in premenopausal women with diabetes when compared to women without diabetes. The authors of the same analysis recommended that other blood sugar lowering agents be considered in people with other risk factors for bladder cancer such as cigarette smoking, family history, or exposure to certain forms of chemotherapy. Thiazolidinediones reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures in women, possibly as a result of biasing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells away from osteoblast differentiation and toward adipocyte formation. Moreover, women diagnosed with gestational diabetes remain at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease despite blood sugar metabolism returning to normal post-pregnancy. **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients. Women, but not men, receiving Actos (pioglitazone) had a higher number of fractures. Increased fracture risk observed in women is now included in the Actos prescribing information under _Precautions._ The full prescribing label includes additional information about fractures that was gathered during the PROACTIVE study (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events). Over an almost-three-year period, women with type 2 diabetes taking Actos had double the number of fractures compared to women on placebo. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself? One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs. Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?However, the study period for the clinical trials using TZD drugs was short—four years or less. **MEN, TOO?The female subjects were in their midfifties and had been diagnosed with diabetes for two years or less. Fractures are now listed on the Avandia prescribing information under _Warnings and Precautions:_ \"Increased incidence of bone fracture in female patients.\" **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients.

Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs.Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. Actos is an equal opportunity Type 2 diabetes drug that causes bladder cancer in men and women. However, women who take Actos for type 2 diabetes not only are at risk for bladder cancer but are also at risk for fractures known as secondary osteoporosis. Type 2 diabetes is manageable with a complementary prescription drug and nutrition. But bladder cancer and bone fractures? At the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, their study aimed to determine the risk of fractures associated with thiazolidinedione therapy and to evaluate the effect on bone density. Interpretation: Long-term thiazolidinedione use doubles the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. In yet another study, there was evidence that both the TZD class of drugs causes bone loss and increase fracture risk, specifically in women. Observational studies using data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort reported that older postmenopausal TZD users experience bone loss at the rate of -0.61% annually compared with non-TZD users. Improvement of bone safety of TZD-based therapy may be achieved by using combination therapy with other anti-diabetic therapies, or preventing bone loss by using available anti-osteoporotic drugs, or development of a new class of selective TZDs, which may have sparing or even beneficial effects on skeleton. Women beware of Actos, bladder cancer, and bone fractures. Insulin resistance is decreased ; Adipocyte differentiation is modified ; VEGF-induced angiogenesis is inhibited ; Leptin levels decrease (leading to an increased appetite) ; Levels of certain interleukins (e.g. TZDs generally decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Although the increase in LDL-C may be more focused on the larger LDL particles, which may be less atherogenic, the clinical significance of this is currently unknown. One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs. Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. In just a matter of a few months, these changes were measured indirectly with bone turnover markers in women. Their markers for building-bone osteoblasts were decreased while markers of bone breakdown were normal. This finding is based on lab mice, but further research in this important area is underway.In a reanalysis of data from a Fosamax trial, it was determined that postmenopausal diabetic women tended to not gain as much bone density as nondiabetics taking Fosamax.Also of note, the diabetics in the placebo group lost bone more rapidly at the hip.Research is needed to guide the design of strategies for improving diabetics' bone health. ; Experiment: The current treatment plan consist of therapy for ketoacidosis was started upon admissions into the hospital.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition. People with COPD are recommended by a number of guidelines to have a pneumococcal vaccination. Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles. Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults. Wearing surgical masks by the sick may also prevent illness. Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the \n\n Vaccination prevents against certain bacterial and viral pneumonias both in children and adults. Influenza vaccines are modestly effective at preventing symptoms of influenza, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly influenza vaccination for every person 6 months and older. Immunizing health care workers decreases the risk of viral pneumonia among their patients. Vaccinations against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae have good evidence to support their use. There is strong evidence for vaccinating children under the age of 2 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine). Vaccinating children against Streptococcus pneumoniae has led to a decreased rate of these infections in adults, because many adults acquire infections from children. A Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine is available for adults, and has been found to decrease the risk of invasive \n\n Screening studies for lung cancer have only been done in high risk populations, such as smokers and workers with occupational exposure to certain substances. In December 2013 the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) changed its long-standing recommendation that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for lung cancer to the following: \"The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults ages 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery\". Prof. Dr. Jyotsna Joshi asserts the importance of preventive adult vaccinations, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination and also throws light on the schedule for dual vaccination. Physicians treating adult patients have poor awareness of preventive vaccinations. Nevertheless, vaccination is an important aspect of management of respiratory disorders and reduces morbidity and mortality. Adult Respiratory Vaccination, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination is very important and physicians need to be aware of these. Vaccination is an important intervention in the preventive strategy, but in the adult population, it is a much neglected subject. This article emphasises the adult respiratory vaccinations, that are given to prevent respiratory diseases or exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. The two main vaccinations in this group consist of pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. The recommendations are largely based on Advisory Committee on Vaccination Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumococcal infections, including pneumonia and invasive disease such as bacteraemia and meningitis, are important sources of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children, older adults (≥65 years of age), and persons with conditions that affect their ability to make antibodies to capsular polysaccharides. Patients with chronic lung disease are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia, and patients with conditions such as heart failure are more likely to have adverse outcomes if pneumonia occurs. Asplenia greatly increases the risk for overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis, and a cerebrospinal fluid leak or a cochlear implant greatly increases the risk for pneumococcal meningitis. Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are approved for use. PPSV is used in selected adults and children ≥2 years of age but not in infants or toddlers <2 years of age since polysaccharide antigens are poorly immunogenic in this age group. Invasive pneumococcal disease is as scary as it sounds. Invasive pneumococcal disease can put your child’s life at risk. If invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) sounds scary, that’s because it is. It’s a group of illnesses caused by bacteria called pneumococcus bacteria. Invasive pneumococcal disease can include meningitis that may lead to brain damage or even death. Invasive pneumococcal disease can spread through a cough. Includes invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae nonserotype b and unknown serotype. In fact, vaccines have helped make widespread epidemics — smallpox, polio, diphtheria, measles, rubella, and mumps — feel like a distant memory. Vaccines help prevent disease while antibiotics are usually only given to children after they become ill. This is especially concerning for invasive pneumococcal disease, since its germs have often developed a resistance to certain antibiotics. Generally, preteens receive HPV vaccine at the same time as whooping cough and meningitis vaccines. CDC encourages clinicians to begin implementing the 2-dose schedule in their practice to protect their preteen patients from HPV cancers. reduced the cause of heart disease among adults.

It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. development in clinical high risk youth: Prediction of schizophrenia versus other psychotic disorders: This study was a follow up study involving participants from the NAPLS-1 study. Researchers checked for three different signs in their patients: psychosis-risk symptoms present at baseline (these plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism), onset of psychosis during the two and a half-year follow-along period of NAPLS-1, and psychotic disorder diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The study showed that people in early adolescence who showed poor social indicators were four times as likely to develop schizophrenia. Clinical assessment of schizophrenia is carried out by a mental health professional based on observed behavior, reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, resulting in different presentations for the same disorder. The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms First-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then.

It is considered to be rarely diagnosed and is a schizophrenia without psychotic symptoms. A parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis – Toxoplasma gondii – may be involved in the cause of around a fifth of schizophrenia cases in the US. University of Pennsylvania researcher Greg Smith calculated that around a fifth of schizophrenia cases may be attributable toT. More recently, studies have linked T. gondii infection to schizophrenia, and some have found that antipsychotic medication may even stop the parasite from replicating. But such research has been met with much criticism. Smith wanted to determine the proportion of schizophrenia cases that could be attributable to T.gondii infection. Smith calculated the PAF fraction throughout an average lifetime to be 21.4%, meaning that a fifth of all schizophrenia cases over a lifetime could be prevented by stopping T. gondiiinfections from occurring. He notes that many countries have a much higher prevalence of T. gondii infections than the US, and such countries also have a higher prevalence of schizophrenia. A new randomized trial from Taiwan shows that a common food preservative could enhance the effect of a schizophrenia drug, even in the case of people normally resistant to treatment. (PET) brain scan of a schizophrenic male patient aged 23 during hallucination. \"The ultimate goal is to develop a strategy in which a simple brain scan could provide the necessary information to help select the best medication -- or treatment approach -- for an individual patient,\" said study co-author Dr. Anil Malhotra, director of psychiatry research at the Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York City. While there's a perception that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, that's not the case. \"We have no way to predict how an individual patient with schizophrenia is going to respond to treatment,\" Malhotra said. \"Essentially, we use a trial-and-error approach to treatment choices.\" Patients may remain psychotic, leading to more costs and devastating consequences such as suicide. In the new study, Malhotra and colleagues at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y., used functional-MRI brain scans to develop a measurement of how well two regions of the brain communicate with each other. The researchers tried out the strategy on a group of 41 patients, aged 15 to 40, experiencing their first \"psychotic break.\" Using information gained from that trial, the researchers tested their technique in 40 patients hospitalized for psychotic illness. Seventy-six percent of the time, the investigators successfully predicted the response of the second group of patients to drug treatments. \"We were close to these goals with the current work and are now looking to launch additional research in this area to hopefully increase this signal to those levels,\" said Malhotra.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. In Fiscal Year 2014, Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the Title X Family Planning grant program. The proposed American Health Care Act, announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood \"ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants\". families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method\" ; Use of contraception, which the World Health Organization has listed as essential medicines, will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the Guttmacher Institute ; An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that \"the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice\". They emphasized that the bill \"promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society\". The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council. The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and \"among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method\". Passage of the legislation was controversial \n\nAbortion in Wisconsin is legal up to the 22nd week of pregnancy. However, the Center for Reproductive Rights in its What if Roe Fell website labels the state as hostile towards abortion rights e.g., 20-week ban, telemedicine ban, TRAP requirements, admitting privileges requirement, transfer agreement requirement, reporting requirement, parental consent required, mandatory counseling, mandatory ultrasound and waiting period requirements. There is a “pro-choice” activist community in the state. One pro choice organization based in Wisconsin is Wisconsin Alliance for Reproductive Health. Wisconsin women participated in the #YouKnowMe movement and the #StoptheBans movement in 2019. There has been some anti-abortion violence, including a bomb attack against a Planned Parenthood clinic in April 2012. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health.

The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported \"the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.\" first ruled ineffective in the United States in 1941, in United States v. 11 1/4 Dozen Packages of Articles Labeled in Part Mrs. Moffat's Shoo-Fly Powders for Drunkenness. The New England Journal of Medicine reported a case study of a patient whose wife secretly gave him a dose of a product called \"tartaro emetico\" which contained trivalent antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and is sold in Central America as an aversive treatment for alcohol abuse. When admitted to the hospital, and later in the intensive care unit, he experienced severe chest pains, cardiac abnormalities, renal and hepatic toxicity, and nearly died. The Journal reports that \"Two years later, he [the patient] reports complete abstinence from alcohol.\" The study concluded that 96.5% of men with bronchogenic carcinoma were heavy to chain smokers, compared to 73.7% of the general population. Statistically, it was rare to find cases of epidermoid or undifferentiated carcinoma in males who haven’t been heavy smokers. Moreover, 96.1% of people with lung cancer smoked for over 20 years, which leads the researchers to hypothesize a 10-year or more lag time between starting smoking and exhibiting the first signs of cancer. Since the overwhelming majority of smokers smoked cigarettes and more cigarette users inhale, this was thought to be a factor in developing lung cancer at a higher rate. Most importantly, the study proved a dose-dependent relationship. to treat, and exacerbation of sleep apnea. The FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging. The FDA has required that testosterone pharmaceutical labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. They have also required the label include concerns about abuse and dependence. Injectable forms of testosterone can cause a lung problem called pulmonary oil microembolism (POME). A legitimate treatment regimen in the first year after a myocardial infarction may include: a statin, an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, paracetamol and an antidepressant. ; In anesthesia (particularly IV anesthesia and general anesthesia) multiple agents are almost always required – including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as midazolam or propofol, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or fentanyl, a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a halogenated ether anesthetic such as sevoflurane or desflurane.

The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR). Around 56 million abortions are performed each year in the world, with about 45% done unsafely. Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. , 37% of the world's women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it. Historically, abortions have been attempted using \n\n 14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. Outpatient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days' gestation as it before 63 days. There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical \n\n to lack of access to modern contraceptives; according to the Guttmacher Institute, providing access to contraceptives would result in about 14.5 million fewer unsafe abortions and 38,000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide. The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and \n\nAbortion in Uganda is illegal unless performed by a licensed medical doctor in a situation where the woman's life is deemed to be at risk. With women lacking access to safe and legal abortions, many of them turn to unsafe abortion practices, such as self-induced abortions. There are many legal and socioeconomic barriers to safe abortion and other family planning services, which often results in women using unsafe abortion methods and being deterred from seeking post-abortion medical care.

Abortion was used as a manner of birth control in Armenia and the number of maternal deaths from abortion complications used to be very high (between 10 and 20% in 2000). In 2014, 21.77% of pregnancies in Armenia ended in abortion, a slight rise from the all-time low recorded in 2010 (21.52%).

Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease typically found in people over the age of 65 years. Worldwide, approximately 24 million people have dementia; 60% of these cases are due to Alzheimer's. The clinical sign of Alzheimer's is progressive cognition deterioration. understand the molecular biology of the aging brain. Annual checkups are used to track the impact of genetic markers, brain images, diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors on cognitive changes in the women. The data has shown a link between a human leukocyte antigen and brain health with the HLA-DRB1*13:02 allele correlating with less brain damage and with cognitive health over time. This observation provides a molecular mechanism to explain the widely published observation that infections by certain pathogens, such as herpes virus, contribute to loss of brain function and increased incidence of Alzheimer Disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, and affects as many as 5.1 million Americans. In Alzheimer’s disease, a protein fragment called beta-amyloid accumulates at abnormally high levels in the brain. In the the most common type of Alzheimer’s disease, late-onset Alzheimer’s, symptoms usually appear after age 65. Elderly people with visual disorders that are left untreated are significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease — the most common form of dementia, according to a University of Michigan Health System study. The study appears online ahead of print in the American Journal of Epidemiology and may draw a new picture of poor vision as predictor of dementia rather than as a symptom after the diagnosis. “Visual problems can have serious consequences and are very common among the elderly, but many of them are not seeking treatment,” says lead author Mary A.M. Rogers, Ph.D, research assistant professor of internal medicine at the U-M Medical School and research director of the Patient Safety Enhancement Program at the U-M Health System and the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center. ”Our results indicate that it is important for elderly individuals with visual problems to seek medical attention so that the causes of the problems can be identified and treated,” Rogers says. These include reading, playing board games, other mentally stimulating activities, social networking, as well as physical activity such as walking and routine exercising. According to a survey conducted by the National Eye Health Education Program, less than 11 percent of respondents understood that there are no early warning signs for eye problems such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. The study was based on the surveys and medical information from 625 people compiled from 1992-2005. Approximately 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease and the number has doubled since 1980. Alzheimer’s disease patients show a relentless decline in memory over the course of the disease, which is accompanied by both brain atrophy and by characteristic deposits in the brain tissue\n\n Functional magnetic resonance imaging looks to the central nervous system to compare time and topography of activity in the brain for lie detection. While a polygraph detects changes in activity in the peripheral nervous system, fMRI has the potential to catch the lie at the 'source'. fMRIs use electromagnets to create pulse sequences in the cells of the brain. The fMRI scanner then detects the different pulses and fields that are used to distinguish tissue structures and the distinction between layers of the brain, matter type, and the ability to see growths.

New strategies may be able to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia among older adults, according to background information in the article. Accurate methods of identifying which people are at high risk for dementia in old age would help physicians determine who could benefit from these interventions. However, previous research has not addressed whether measuring atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict the onset of AD at an earlier stage, before cognitive symptoms appear. Tom den Heijer, M.D., Ph.D., of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues used MRI to assess the brain volumes of 511 dementia-free elderly people who were part of the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based cohort study that began in 1990. They screened the participants for dementia at initial visits in 1995 and 1996 and then in follow-up visits between 1997 and 2003, during which they asked about memory problems and performed extensive neuropsychological testing. The authors also monitored the medical records of all participants. During the follow-up, 35 participants developed dementia and 26 were diagnosed with AD. People with severe amygdalar or hippocampal atrophy had the highest risk of developing dementia or AD over the course of the study, which followed participants for an average period of six years. \"Concerning the extent of atrophy, we found in those destined to develop dementia volume reductions between 17 percent and 5 percent, depending on how long before the diagnosis of dementia the MRI was conducted,\" the authors report. \"In persons with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, volume reductions compared with healthy elderly persons are between 25 percent and 40 percent, suggesting that atrophy rates accelerate in patients with Alzheimer disease.\" \"Our study suggests that structural brain imaging can help identify people at high risk for developing dementia, even before they have any memory complaints or measurable cognitive impairment,\" they write. \"However, we must bear in mind that most people with atrophy did not develop dementia, even after six years. Further prospective population studies are therefore required to find additional biomarkers, including other brain imaging parameters, that alone or in combination with clinical and genetic characteristics can help separate those who are at risk for developing dementia from those who are not.\" \"Reduced Brain Volume May Predict Dementia In Healthy Elderly People.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Prior to her death she had indicated that she would not like to be kept artificially alive if brain dead. The fetus had suffered from oxygen deprivation and was suspected to be non-viable. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently \"induced miscarriage\". Her children are also benefiting from the sensible precautions taken by the rest of us.\" Courts have supported family's arbitrary definitions of futility to include simple biological survival, as in the Baby K case (in which the courts ordered a child born with only a brain stem instead of a complete brain to be kept on a ventilator based on the religious belief that all life must be preserved). China, which has ended their one-child policy, and now has a two child policy, has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy. Many, but not all, \n\nA Baptist seminary leader joined a special panel at Loyola University New Orleans to discuss end-of-life cases that have sparked national debate. The group covered the cases of Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl placed on a ventilator following complications from tonsil and nasal surgery, and Marlise Munoz, a young mother declared brain dead but kept on life support for two months for the sake of her 14-week-old fetus. Popik cited a study by the American Academy of Neurology that indicated, while the protocol for declaring brain death varies widely from state to state and hospital to hospital, an average hospital determines brain death as many as 50 times a year. Brain death is the total and irreversible cessation of the entire brain, including the brain stem, and is determined by a complete examination using a set of diagnostic criteria and not by a single test, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG), White explained. “The science of brain death is very good. Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on Dec. 12, 2013, after three neurologists confirmed she was unable to breathe on her own, had no blood flow to her brain, and showed no sign of electrical activity in the brain. When McMath’s family refused to remove the ventilator, a legal agreement was eventually forced requiring that a death certificate be issued by the Alameda County, Calif., coroner’s office before the patient was moved to an undisclosed facility where life support continues. White said families sometimes have trouble accepting a doctor’s verdict because a patient on life support has a heartbeat, breathes and feels warm to the touch. Wilde added that the issue is compounded in today’s society because death is often not discussed. Lemke agreed, saying families used to care for patients in their final days at home and watched their loved ones struggle for longer periods of time. “We’re isolated and insulated from the reality of death, so when death comes it is all-the-more shocking and we are all-the-more ill-prepared for it,” Lemke said. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical \n\nMaternal somatic support after brain death occurs when a brain dead patient is pregnant and their body is kept alive to deliver a fetus. Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990–96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age. Past cases In the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were \"30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series).\" In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother \"since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature.\" Life support complications Throughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including \"infection, hemodynamic instability, diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilothermia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\" However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Research into preterm births indicates that \"a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. Brain death vs. similar conditions It is important to understand the similarities and differences between brain death and two other conditions: persistent vegetative state and coma. Difference between brain death and persistent vegetative state Patients in a persistent vegetative state \"are alive but also have severely impaired consciousness, although their eyes may open spontaneously. These patients do not acknowledge the examiner; they do not attend or track objects that are presented to them; their movements are non-purposeful; they do not speak.\" The difference between the two states is that brain death means \"death of the brainstem\" which can be clinically diagnosed and vegetative state means \"permanent and total loss of forebrain function\" which needs further investigation. Difference between brain death and coma People in comas have \"presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses.\" However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state.

Federal and state laws Several laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights. United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The global airline industry continues to grow rapidly, but consistent and robust profitability is elusive. Measured by revenue, the industry has doubled over the past decade, from US$369 billion in 2004 to a projected $746 billion in 2014, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Yet profit margins are still low, less than 3 percent \n\n join the Oneworld airline alliance. ; According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the Saudi-led coalition made 3,936 airstrikes in Yemen during 2016. ; In 2016, U.S. airlines cancelled 1.17% of flights, lost 2.70 bags per 1,000 customers and \"bumped\" ticketed passengers from overbooked flights at a rate of 0.62 per 10,000 passengers, the lowest numbers recorded in over a decade, while on-time arrival rates and customer complaints also improved. Flight Centre was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a 80% decline in the company's share price (or about 85% from the August 2018 peak), cancellation of a previously announced dividend, and a suspension in trading of shares from 23 March 2020 to 7 April 2020.

Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. The risk \n\n New vaccines against currently circulating influenza variants are required every year due to the diversity of flu viruses and variable efficacy of vaccines to prevent them. High-risk populations, including the elderly and those with chronic disease, often acquire only limited immunity towards the flu from vaccines. The vaccines have been found to be 30% to 70% effective in preventing hospitalization from the flu or pneumonia. Therefore, the release of COVID-19 vaccines were accompanied with unknown side effects. An analysis of those IFR rates indicates that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom a fatal COVID-19 infection is two orders of magnitude more likely than the annualized risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza. New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Vaccinating children may protect those around them. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high risk groups. The vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with egg allergies. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms. The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons. History Vaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans.

Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. African green monkeys (also called vervets, genus Chlorocebus) in African populations are heavily infected with SIVagm, while the virus is absent in the founder isolate \n\n In spring of 2012, three miners working in an abandoned copper mine in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, south China, developed fatal pneumonia. While no person-to-person transmission was documented, the full range of mammalian hosts susceptible Mòjiāng virus is unknown. In 1998, The Zoonotic Importance of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Transmission From Human to Monkey was noticed. In 2001, scientists noticed that antibodies peculiar to humans were found in macaque monkeys, both wild and domesticated. Of the panel of human viruses studied, measles, influenza A, and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 were found in some of the studied animals. In 2006, scientists noticed HPT of measles, rubella, and parainfluenza in the case of performing monkeys, who are \"a common phenomena in Asia\". In 2018, scientists speculated that HPT was likely to have occurred in the case of human malaria parasites. Also in 2018, scientists speculated that an outbreak of tuberculosis among a closed breeding colony of Aotus monkeys was likely due to continuing intermittent HPT exposure. According to research published by the US National Institutes of Health, the triple reassortant H2N3 virus isolated from diseased pigs in the United States in 2006 is pathogenic for certain mammals without prior adaptation and transmits among swine and ferrets. In contrast to human H2N2 virus, which served as a control and largely caused mild pneumonia similar to seasonal influenza A viruses, the swine H2N3 virus was more pathogenic causing severe pneumonia in nonhuman primates. Both viruses replicated in the entire respiratory tract, but only swine H2N3 could \n\n Infection in humans and horses are different. When the virus infects humans, symptoms manifest as fever, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and back pain. Two established examples are rabies and bubonic plague, both of which can be deadly for humans. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) originated in chimpanzees or gorillas, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by an avian coronavirus, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic came from – well, you can guess. Ebola virus, for example, was passed from apes to humans, presumably by the consumption of ‘bush meat’: wild animals such as fruit bats or monkeys that are hunted for food. Any virus or bacterium that infects our primate relatives could also be dangerous to us. To identify new infectious agents that jump the species barrier, therefore, the German researchers teamed up with behavioural scientists in Ivory Coast, West Africa, to study the great apes. Whenever one of the apes that they are studying becomes ill or dies, the team collects blood, faeces and urine samples to send to Fabian and his group in Berlin. If the ape dies, it is autopsied on-site by one of the veterinarians. Fabian then searches\n\nAnthrax, a disease so far not associated with tropical rain forests, is common in the Ivory Coast's Taï National Park and is posing a serious threat to wildlife there. This is revealed in a study by scientists from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the University of Glasgow, and the Ivorian National Animal Health Institute. In 2004, Leendertz' team at RKI discovered a previously unknown type of the anthrax bacterium in dead chimpanzees in the rainforests of Taï National Park: Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis. Studies conducted since have shown that the same type has also caused mortality in isolated cases in chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants in Cameroon and the Central African Republic. \"To our surprise, almost 40 percent of all animal deaths in Taï National Park we investigated were attributable to anthrax,\" reports Emmanuel Couacy-Hymann from the Ivorian Animal Health Institute. The researchers found the pathogen in several monkey species, duikers, mongoose, and a porcupine. Most seriously affected were the chimpanzees: 31 of the 55 individuals whose carcasses were examined had died from the disease. Human infections with the atypical type of the anthrax bacterium have\n\n\"In order to cause a pandemic, H5N1 viruses will have to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person. The H5 hemagglutinin (HA) is found in influenza viruses that typically infect avian species, so efficient person-to-person spread could happen if the H5N1 virus reassorts, or exchanges genes, with circulating human influenza viruses giving rise to a virus with the H5 HA (to which the population is not immune) in a gene constellation that confers the property of transmissibility. Alternatively, efficient person-to-person spread could occur if the H5N1 virus evolves and adapts to more efficient replication and transmissibility in the human population.\" H5N1 may cause \n\n A well-established example is lactate dehydrogenase virus, which is often found in mouse tumours.

Of particular note is the distinction between symptomatic UTI vs. asymptomatic UTI (or, ASB). These definitions were provided to us from the North Carolina Center for Hospital Quality and Patient Safety, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and from a toolkit used by the Michigan Health and Hospital Association written by Mohamad G. Fakih, MD, MPH, Sanjay Saint, MD, MPH, Sarah Krein, RN, PhD., and Russ Olmsted, MPH, CIC. Finally, we also provide recent material and definitions used by the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) as a reference source. Given the important clinical and economic consequences of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), researchers across the world have attempted various methods to prevent this common, costly, and morbid patient safety problem. In this section, we summarize the evidence supporting the use of several practices to prevent CAUTI. Fortunately, members of our Ann Arbor VA Medical Center/University of Michigan Patient Safety Research group have been involved in the development of most of these guidelines. Do not use the indwelling catheter unless you must! Urinary tract infection represents almost 40% of all healthcare-associated infections, with the vast majority due to the indwelling urinary catheter. Over 900,000 patients develop a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in a U.S. hospital each year. Urinary catheter-related infection leads to substantial morbidity. The incidence of bacteriuria in catheterized patients is about 5% per day. The presentation of catheter-associated infection varies from asymptomatic bacteriuria to overwhelming sepsis and even death. Patients with bloodstream infection may present with fever, confusion, and hypotension. A key first step leading to CAUTI is the colonization of the catheter with organisms. Indeed, urinary catheters readily develop biofilm – a collection of microbial organisms on a surface that is surrounded by an extracellular matrix – on their inner and outer surfaces once they are inserted.

This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place. Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional or by the person themselves (clean intermittent self catheterization). Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique. Patients can be taught to use a self catheterization technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters. Self catheterization requires doing the procedure periodically during the day, the frequency depending on fluid intake \n\nVA nursing homes serve nearly 50,000 Veterans each year, and urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most commonly reported infection. To help reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in nursing homes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Safety Program for Long-term Care: HAIs/CAUTI aimed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), enhance frontline healthcare professional knowledge about infection prevention, and improve the safety culture in nursing homes. The questionnaire included 30 items about infection prevention, with a specific focus on CAUTI prevention. Most VA nursing home infection prevention programs were integrated within their VA acute care infection prevention programs, and they had more infection prevention related resources. Overall, a lower percentage of VA nursing homes reported having policies concerning appropriate catheter use or catheter insertion compared to non-VA nursing homes. For example, only 64% of VA nursing homes had policies specifying the appropriate indications for catheter use compared with 81% of non-VA nursing homes. Mody L, Greene M, Saint S, et al., and Krein S. Comparing Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection Prevention Programs between VA and Non-VA Nursing Homes. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. Nearly seven million hospitalized patients each year acquire infections while being treated for other conditions. The culprit, according to a study published in the American Journal of Infection Control, is nurse burnout and has been linked to higher rates of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). These problems affect nurses both personally and professionally, and it may affect their patients as well. It then compared a hospital’s percentage of burnout nurses to its rates of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs).\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

However, a recent study on high blood pressure took place in a barbershop, and researchers wanted to learn more about patient compliance to medical recommendations and medications. Why Study High Blood Pressure in a Barbershop? Researchers chose to conduct a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop because it was a familiar setting within the participants’ community. They also trained barbers, who were considered as trusted advisors, to measure blood pressure and council participants on hypertension. Participants in the intervention group were screened for high blood pressure by their barber and then referred to meet with a pharmacist who was in the barbershop. The pharmacist provided medication and education for lifestyle modifications. The control group received education from their barber on lifestyle modifications. Researchers concluded that the location of this study and its convenience impacted patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Additionally, the intervention group did not have to go to another location to receive help from the pharmacists, as they were immediately available in the barbershop. While not a physician, the barber was viewed by all participants as a reliable member of the community. Therefore, the experiment suggests that patients must trust the individual delivering healthcare recommendations. The barbershop study demonstrates that to improve care on a larger scale, fewer restrictions should be placed on the type of qualified provider and setting of treatment. PreviousWhat Is Phlebotomy And Why Is It Convenient to Have In Your Primary Care Doctor’s Office? The purpose of the $8.5 million grant awarded to the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute physician is to support a new, randomized, controlled clinical trial aimed at enlisting African-American barbers in the fight against hypertension. The physician, Ronald G. Victor, MD, conducted a previous study that showed offering blood pressure checks during men's haircuts and encouraging patrons with hypertension to follow up with physicians could save hundreds of lives annually. Now, with the grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Dr. Victor will conduct a new trial with 500 African-American male patrons of 20 Los Angeles-area barbershops. The goal of this trial is to test the effectiveness of barbershop hypertension programs and evaluate whether expanding such programs is feasible and cost-effective. However, less than half have their blood pressure under control. Watching motivational videos on how to keep your blood pressure in check could considerably improve your cardiovascular health. Dubbed the silent killer due to its asymptomatic nature, high blood pressure damages blood vessels over time. Luckily, there are several things that a person can do to lower their blood pressure. How does e-counseling affect hypertension? Nolan and his team explain that using the Internet in search of health tips is \"the third most popular online activity,\" with 72 percent of users engaging in it. New research shows that this dairy product, rich in probiotic properties, lowers blood pressure in rodents. The other group only received generic emails with information about blood pressure management. The researchers deem this reduction \"meaningful\" and quote a previous study that found that a 10-point decrease in systolic blood pressure can reduce all-cause mortality risk by 13 percent. there are far more important things 2 bark about. no education sets people back, no jobs, bad \n\nLos Angeles, CA (BlackNews.com) — Visiting a barbershop in California this Saturday could mean more than getting a haircut. It might be a lifesaver. The Black Barbershop Health Outreach Program, a unique, grassroots approach to health screening and education, will be held at more than 80 barbershops in 23 cities statewide on Saturday, May 22 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. In hundreds of nearby barbershops, African American men nationwide will receive free screening for diabetes and hypertension, and learn why early detection of prostate cancer can be a life-saving decision. Led by Dr. Bill J. Releford, D.P.M., founder of The Diabetic Amputation Prevention (DAP) Foundation, along with a squadron of volunteers, the outreach program seeks to empower African American men to better understand cardiovascular diseases through education, testing and prevention. For example, African American men are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than white men, according to the Office of Minority Health, an arm of Health and Human Services, a federal agency. Through black-owned barbershops, which represent a cultural institution of familiarity and trust, the outreach program has adopted a novel means to spread health information. Data collected from the California barbershops will be analyzed and processed at Charles Drew University. The outreach program also enjoys support from health and community partners, such as: L.A. Care Health Plan, St. Mary’s Hospital of Long Beach, Heritage Community Initiatives, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Mu Chi Chapter Inc. of Chi Eta Phi Sorority, Inc., Solano Coalition for Better Health, 100 Black Men of Long Beach, CA and\n\nConducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop instead of a traditional clinical setting offers several advantages. Firstly, the familiarity of the barbershop setting within the participants' community can help foster a sense of comfort and trust. In the study mentioned, barbers were trained to measure blood pressure and provide counseling on hypertension. As trusted advisors within the community, barbers played a crucial role in engaging participants and facilitating discussions on healthcare. This approach allowed for easy access to blood pressure screenings and immediate referrals to healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists who were available in the barbershop. The convenience of having healthcare services provided within the barbershop itself eliminates the need for participants to travel to another location for assistance. Moreover, the study highlighted that the interventions in the barbershop setting were associated with increased patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Participants in the intervention group, who received screenings and pharmacist consultations in the barbershop, were more receptive to lifestyle modification recommendations. Overall, conducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop setting offers advantages such as enhanced patient engagement, improved accessibility, and increased compliance. For example, they suffer higher rates of morbidity due to stroke, perinatal disease, and diabetes mellitus compared to Whites. They also suffer high rates of colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. Distal stressors have been linked to these health disparities among African Americans.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Elevated cortisol levels can compromise the immune system. Negative environmental influences during this critical period of brain development can have lifelong consequences. They investigated associations between childhood adversity and child adjustment in 338 5-year-olds. Children with high cortisol reactivity were rated by teachers as least prosocial when living under adverse conditions, but most prosocial when living under more benign conditions (and in comparison to children scoring low on cortisol reactivity). Regarding characteristics of the category of Phenotypic Factors, Pluess and Belsky (2009) reported that the effect of child care quality on teacher-rated socioemotional adjustment varied as a function of infant temperament in the case of 761 4.5-year-olds participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005). These plasma analytes reflected inflammation, oxidative stress, hormones, and metabolism. It was discovered that individuals who are at a high-risk for psychosis have high levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormone imbalances. Cortisol Level and Risk for Psychosis: Researchers tested the cortisol contents of saliva in 256 individuals. It was discovered that patients that were at a higher risk of psychosis, or already had the diagnosis, had increased cortisol levels. This study suggests the need for future research focusing on the hormone levels of individuals with, or at risk of, psychosis. and it is hypothesized that it might be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Sex Differences Mood disorders, specifically stress-related mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, have been shown to have differing rates of diagnosis based on sex. Underlying these sex differences, studies have shown a dysregulation of stress-responsive neuroendocrine function causing an increase in the likelihood of developing these affective disorders. Neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is \n\n“Low levels of the stress hormone cortisol marks out children at higher risk of developing chronic fatigue syndrome as adults,” reported the BBC today. It said that if children with low levels of cortisol are exposed to trauma such as sexual abuse, they are six times more likely to develop the condition when older. Contrary to the impression that might be gained from parts of the news report, this study did not assess cortisol levels in childhood, but only in adults with or without CFS. The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Archives of General Psychiatry . The researchers wanted to investigate this by looking at levels of the hormone cortisol in people with and without CFS. Cortisol is involved in the body’s stress response. Of these people, 124 were confirmed as healthy, and acted as controls. But during the pruning process of adolescence, if a child is subject to high stress \n\n from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, stimulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release into the blood stream. From here ACTH triggers the release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol, known as the main stress hormone, creates a negative feedback loop back to the hypothalamus to deactivate the stress response. The women were exposed to each condition on different days. Those who had high chronic stress levels and a low cortisol reactivity to the acute stress task consumed significantly more calories from chocolate cake than women with low chronic stress levels after both control and stress conditions. High cortisol levels, in combination with high insulin levels, may be responsible for stress-induced eating, as research shows high cortisol reactivity is associated with hyperphagia, \n\nEarly warning British brain scientists have identified a 'biological signpost' for clinical depression and say it could help identify those are at risk of developing the debilitating mental illness. The findings suggest teenagers could in future be screened for such signals, and those at highest risk could be helped to develop the kind of coping strategies and \"brain fitness\" to help them avoid becoming depressive. \"(And) we now have a very real way of identifying those teenage boys most likely to develop clinical depression.\" For their study, Goodyear's team measured levels of cortisol in saliva from two large separate groups of teenagers. The first group of 660 provided samples on four school mornings within a week and then again 12 months later. A second group of 1198 teenagers gave samples over three school mornings. Childhood Physical health development Research has shown that by the time a child reaches the age of six, if they have experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), such as neglect, their chances of having overall poor physical health increases by two-fold. Exposure to ACEs, which exert effect by increasing an individual exposure to toxic stress during key periods of development, has also been linked to higher risks of chronic diseases, respiratory and heart disease, cancer and suicide. Further, maltreatment and neglect during infancy has been linked to a variety of physical development issues, including poor growth and insufficient brain and neuronal development. The term \"failure to thrive\" refers to an abnormal pattern of weight gain or weight loss, or experiencing insufficient growth patterns in accordance with a child's age and developmental stage. The most common symptoms of non-organic failure to thrive are insufficient weight gain or growth in height, and these common symptoms can affect a child over his/her life course by setting them back in weight class and can hinder their overall growth. And in more extreme cases, non-organic failure to thrive can affect a child over their whole life course by actually damaging his/her cognitive development and his/her immune system due to insufficient calorie intake or lack of medical\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 1 April, two United States officials said that China had deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community. The sources stated that the Chinese central government does not know the extent of the outbreak because lower-level officials reported falsified statistics to avoid losing their positions. The CIA is currently investigating in China to assess the COVID-19 totals. Financial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping. In early January 2020, the local government of Henan Province with its complete disinfection measures, effective and intensive publicity, a strong awareness of epidemic prevention and quarantine among the people, the \n\n on the outbreak on 5 January 2020. On 14 January, the WHO tweeted: \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China.\" On 15 February 2021, WHO investigators in China said they had found evidence that the initial outbreak in Wuhan was more widespread than originally thought. They asked the Chinese government for permission to study hundreds of thousands of blood samples from Wuhan; as of 15 February, this permission had not been granted. China is facing a heightened risk of more MERS cases because of frequent contacts with areas of the Middle East and South Korea that have been hit hard by the potentially lethal viral infection, the nation's top health authority said. Mao Qun'an, spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said on Wednesday that China faces a \"substantially increased risk\" of more imported cases. Mao made his remarks at a news conference as the condition of China's first confirmed MERS patient, who is from South Korea, was reported to be in stable condition at a hospital in Guangdong province. Inspections of disease control and treatment work will be performed at high risk regions like south Guangdong province and the capital of Beijing,\" he said. MERS is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, similar to SARS. There is no vaccine or treatment for the virus, which has a fatality rate of about 40 percent. Also on Wednesday, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine ordered border quarantine staff to refer suspected cases to designated hospitals for further investigation. Chinese who are heading to affected areas should avoid visiting local hospitals and having contact with bats and single-hump camels. A Chinese woman living in South Korea has tested positive for MERS, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Wednesday. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert in Guangdong, said a massive outbreak of MERS in China is unlikely given a lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus. Some patients died of other diseases due to a lack of proper treatment when \n\nKuwait's health ministry said yesterday that an investigation so far hasn't turned up any evidence to suggest that a South Korean business traveler who was diagnosed with MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) after returning to his home country was exposed in Kuwait, the Korea Times reported today. At a media briefing, Mustafa Redha, MD, health ministry undersecretary, said 10 people who had close contact with the South Korean man in Kuwait have tested negative for the virus and the country has taken all steps needed to protect its citizens and visitors from the virus. A 44-year-old man from Riyadh and a 64-year-old man from Hofuf were both diagnosed as having MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and are hospitalized for their infections. Both cases are described as primary and linked to camel contact. The new activity appears to have raised MERS case totals to 2,251 globally since 2012, including 798 deaths.

ALL is typically treated initially with chemotherapy aimed at bringing about remission. This is then followed by further chemotherapy typically over a number of years. Treatment can also include radiation therapy if spread to the brain has occurred. As researchers have learned more about what makes cancer cells different from normal cells, they have developed mAbs to exploit these differences. Newer forms of mAbs are less likely to cause immune reactions. One part attaches to a cancer cell, while the other attaches to an immune cell, bringing the two together and leading to an immune response. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. Cancer cells sometimes take advantage of these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. Researchers have also found promising early results against a number of other cancer types. Only a handful of these treatments have been approved for use so far, but many others are now being studied in clinical trials. In melanoma, this combined approach has been shown to work better than using either treatment alone, but the combination also comes with an increased risk of serious side effects. As researchers have learned over the years, the immune system is very complex. It has also become clear that cancer cells have different ways of eluding the immune system, which makes creating effective vaccines difficult. But what exactly is CAR T-cell therapy? We spoke with Sattva Neelapu, M.D., to learn more. Doctors extract T cells (a type of white blood cell) from the patient’s blood and then add an artificial receptor (called a “chimeric antigen receptor”) to their surface. CAR T-cell therapy can cause some unusual side effects. The most common side effect of CAR T-cell therapy is called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. It’s also known as a “cytokine storm.” About 70-90% of patients experience it, but it’s very short-term and only lasts about five to seven days. It usually starts around the second or third day after the infusion. There’s a very effective remedy for CRS now called tocilizumab, which reverses this side effect fairly quickly. The medicine was originally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but has since been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat CRS. The other side effect is known as “CRES,” which stands for “CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome.” It typically starts around day five after the infusion. Patients eventually recover all of their neurological functions. Which types of cancer can CAR T-cell therapy treat currently? We have different FDA-approved cell therapy products for each of these cancers, thanks to clinical trials. Indolent B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In the United States it is the most common cause of cancer and death from cancer among children. ALL is notable for being the first disseminated cancer to be cured. Survival rates remain lower for babies (50%) and adults (35%). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a personalized cellular therapy treatment for leukemia developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The first-of-its-kind therapy treats cancer by altering a patient's own cells to fight cancer. If you have questions or think you might be a candidate, please discuss with your physician. Over the past several years, cancer researchers have discovered the impact that the immune system can have on treating and preventing cancer. In particular, researchers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center have identified the effect of T cells, which are responsible for the identification and destruction of abnormal substances, like cancer. This treatment allows for the body’s immune system to be super charged with large quantities of CAR T cells which will seek out and attack cancer cells. Who can benefit from this new treatment? If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with ALL, speak with the treating oncologist about all options for treatment. Will this work for my type of cancer? It differs from traditional cancer treatments in several ways. Firstly, CAR-T therapy is a personalized approach that is customized for each individual patient. Secondly, unlike traditional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, CAR-T therapy does not directly kill cancer cells. Instead, it enhances the patient's own immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. It has demonstrated significant success even in cases where other treatments have failed. However, it's important to note that CAR-T therapy also has some unique challenges and potential side effects. It offers a different approach compared to traditional cancer treatments by utilizing genetically modified T-cells to specifically target and destroy cancer cells. While it has shown great promise, it also comes with unique challenges and potential side effects that need to be carefully managed. The gene-modified effector cells are then transplanted back into the person. Typically this process is done in conjunction with a conditioning regimen such as cyclophosphamide, which has been shown to potentiate the effects of infused T-cells. This effect has been attributed to making an \n\nPHILADELPHIA — When doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig’s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans. The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free. Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example. The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission. Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure. It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. Here, in the context of cancer treatment, we are mainly concerned with that second type, the T-cell. In brief, it’s a cutting-edge therapy that genetically programs your own T-cells to be better at recognizing and attacking cancer within. Tinkering with your body’s immune system to try to fight cancer is not entirely new. Designed to act as a bridge between a cancer cell and a T-cell to promote cancer cell death. One of them, sipuleucel-T, sounds very much like a CAR T-cell therapy in that it uses your immune cells which are first collected from the bloodstream individually and then processed in the laboratory; they are activated and made to be more responsive to the tumor cells, then infused back into the bloodstream as the therapy. Ipilimumab is just one example of a medicine that works in this way. T-cells are taken out of your body, genetically programmed to better recognize and kill tumor cells, and then re-introduced as the living therapy. These newer treatments generally arise out of the unfortunate fact that, for patients with late-stage disease, traditional cancer treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, oftentimes offer limited efficacy.

It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This outbreak has since caused a health issue in the city of Wuhan, China which evolved into a global pandemic. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Epidemiologists have also warned of the virus's contagiousness. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The outbreak went unnoticed until 26 December 2019, when Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, noticed a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown origin, several of whom had connections to the Huanan Seafood Market.

The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence. Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, masking, improving ventilation and air filtration, and quarantining those who have been exposed or are symptomatic. Treatments include monoclonal antibodies, novel antiviral drugs, and symptom control. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and tracing contacts of the infected. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented pollution decrease. The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. Etymology The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the \"coronavirus pandemic\", despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus outbreak\" and the \"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\" with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\".

For the patients of osteoarthritis who suffer from knee joint pain but do not want to go for knee replacement surgery, there is an alternative knee treatment known as Viscosupplementation. Poor lubrication due to low hyaluronic acid (HA) levels is one of such causes for osteoarthritis knee pain. Viscosupplomementation is a treatment which involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into the joints to supplement the viscous properties of synovial (lubricating) fluid. Viscosupplementation can also be achieved by taking oral supplements. However, injecting hyaluronic acid into the affected joint is the most prevalent treatment technique. See this viscosupplementation injection video which displays the technique of injection with viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of right elbow joint. Is Viscosupplementation Effective for Knee Joint Pain? However, not all patients of osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation. Only those patients who have mild to moderate osteoarthritis have shown significant improvement in their pain condition. Those having advanced destructive osteoarthritis with chronic knee pain do not seem to have any beneficial effect from viscosupplement injections. When the patients of osteoarthritis with mild to moderate knee joint pain do not get any relief from the following traditional treatments, they are recommended by the doctors to take viscosupplementation treatment. Joint aspiration and intra-articular LA/steroid injection. Once taken, the viscosupplementation injection is effective for 6-8 months. What is the Cost for Viscosupplementation Injection? What are the Side Effects of Viscosupplementation? The side effects of viscosupplement injections are generally mild. The most common side effects are local reactions at the knee joint such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. Viscosupplementation treatment is, till date, available for treating knee joint pains only. Watch the video on viscosupplementation treatments in India for more information on the subject. Intra-articular use of PSGAGs has been shown to improve lameness, signs of arthritis, joint effusion, and synovial fluid quality. IA use of PSGAGs may have an increased risk of Staphylococcus aureus infections within the joint when compared to intra-articular injections of other substances, although this can be prevented by concurrently injecting aminoglycoside antibiotics. Viscosupplementation is a medical procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee or other joints in patients whose pain has failed to respond to conservative approaches. Brand names of viscosupplementation solutions include Hylagan, Orthovisc, Supartz, and Synvisc – all of which we use at Unique Pain Medicine. INJECTIONS CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO KNEE SURGERY, WHILE OTHERS, RELY ON THESE INJECTIONS FOR RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN CAUSED BY AN INJURY OR OSTEOARTHRITIS. After proper sterilization, a needle is placed into the joint under live ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance. A pre-filled syringe of viscosupplementation is then injected into the joint to help loosen the knee and reduce friction thereby decreasing pain, minimizing inflammation, and improving motion. This artificial lubrication will ideally “save” your knee from further deterioration, and help you to avoid surgery. Adds lubrication to the joint which restores movement and minimizes pain. Hip osteoarthritis (OA) and degeneration. What can go wrong with the knee joint? What are knee injections for pain? Knee injections treat knee pain, arthritis, osteoarthritis, swelling, and inflammation. Hyaluronan injections — also known as viscosupplementation — target only knee pain from osteoarthritis. If you are not getting relief from pain medications and other treatments, viscosupplementation knee injection may relieve your knee pain. This therapy increases the effectiveness of synovial fluid present in the knee joint. Usually, viscosupplementation knee injections are recommended to those patients who are not responding to exercise, physical therapy, or other medications. Viscosupplementation injections also provide improved knee joint mobility and joint range of motion. What is stem cell therapy for knee pain? Viscosupplementation injections are used as a treatment for knee joint pain relief, particularly in patients with osteoarthritis who do not wish to undergo knee replacement surgery. The purpose of these injections is to supplement the lubricating properties of the synovial fluid in the joints, which helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. The injection involves the introduction of gel-like substances, called hyaluronates, into the affected joint. By increasing synovial fluid levels of HA, viscosupplementation injections have been effective in reducing pain by decreasing levels of inflammatory substances called prostaglandins. It is important to note that not all patients with osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation injections. Significant improvement in pain has been observed in patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis. However, patients with advanced destructive osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain may not experience the same level of benefits. Please consult with a healthcare professional to determine whether viscosupplementation injections are a suitable option for your specific condition. Euflexxa is an injectable medication used to treat knee pain in people with osteoarthritis (\"wear-and-tear arthritis\"). This fluid thins and become less able to lubricate and protect the knee joint as the inflammatory stress of osteoarthritis takes its toll. The two-step process of drainage and joint lubrication is known as arthrocentesis plus viscosupplementation. After drainage, the Euflexxa injection is delivered into the joint space in the mid-kneecap region. Despite the potential benefits of treatment, viscosupplementation success rates can vary dramatically. What most doctors will agree is that viscosupplementation is not a quick fix. It is really only considered when conservative options have failed or as a means to delay more invasive procedures, such as knee surgery or knee replacement. It is also often used in place of traditional corticosteroid knee injections. Furthermore, repeated corticosteroid shots can actually accelerate cartilage damage. Given the high variability of hyaluronan success rates, some doctors will\n\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and can be a major source of disability. There are no guidelines for the administration of corticosteroids, and they can be associated with increased risk of tendon rupture and infection. Viscosupplementation has gained popularity in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Traditional nonoperative treatment includes activity modification, weight loss, exercise, assistive devices, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs), analgesics, and corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is effective, but not indicated for early stages of the disease in all patients. In recent years, intraarticular viscosupplementation with hyaluronate-derived products has gained popularity as a modality for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. The content of synovial fluid (lubricating fluid of joint), in the presence of osteoarthritis, has a decreased concentration and molecular weight of hyaluronic acid. Injections decrease inflammation and swelling, which decreases pain and increases joint mobility.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Vaginal-lining cells were \n\n study, said it \"addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies.\" Commentary published by the National Health Service (NHS) called the study \"an important proof of concept\" and said it showed that tissue engineering had \"a great deal of potential.\" Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. After about eight years, all four patients reported normal function and pleasure levels during sexual intercourse according to the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire, a validated self-report tool. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible. Martin Birchall, who works on tissue engineering, but was not involved in \n\n Vaginal aplasia is a rare medical condition in which the vagina does not form properly before birth. Sufferers of the condition may have a partially formed vagina, or none at all. First a space is surgically created where the vagina would typically exist. Then tissue from another part of the body is harvested, molded into the shape of a vagina, and grafted into the vagina cavity. Typically, the implanted tissue does not function normally as a muscle, which can lead to low enjoyment of sexual intercourse. Numerous tissues and organs have been induced to regenerate. Other organs and body parts that have been procured to regenerate include: penis, fats, vagina, brain tissue, thymus, and a scaled down human heart. One goal of scientists is to induce full regeneration in more human organs. There are various techniques that can induce regeneration. By 2016, regeneration of tissue had been induced and operationalized by science. There are four main techniques: regeneration by instrument; regeneration by materials; regeneration by drugs and regeneration by in vitro 3D printing. History of human tissue In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue naturally regenerates over time; by default, new available cells replace expended cells. This emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically and via observation. There are many more historical and nuanced understandings about regeneration processes. The aim for these techniques is to use these techniques in the near future for the purpose of regenerating any tissue type in the human body. Regeneration techniques By 2016, regeneration had been operationalised and induced by four main techniques: regeneration by instrument; regeneration by materials; regeneration by 3d printing; and regeneration by drugs. Whilst by 2016, regeneration by 3d printing had been generally operationalised by in vitro (inside the lab) in order to be built and prepare tissue for transplantation. In 1976, a 3 by 3cm scar on a non-diabetic was regenerated by insulin injections and the researchers, highlighting\n\n Between the years 2005 and 2008, four women with vaginal hypoplasia due to Müllerian agenesis were given regenerated vaginas. Vaginal transplantation is procedure whereby donated or laboratory-grown vagina tissue is used to create a 'neovagina'. It is a type of genitoplasty. Congenital disorders such as adrenal hyperplasia can affect the structure and function of the vagina and sometimes the vagina is absent; these can be reconstructed or formed, using a vaginoplasty. Other candidates for the surgery include babies born with a microphallus, people with Müllerian agenesis resulting in vaginal hypoplasia, trans women, and women who have had a vaginectomy after malignancy or trauma. A woman can use an autologous in vitro cultured tissue taken from her vaginal vestibule as transplanted tissue to form the lining of the reconstructed vagina.

Please review the Heart Failure Manual, Heart Transplant Manual , glossary and list of frequently asked questions. What Are the Risks Associated With Heart Transplants? More than 2,000 heart transplants are performed each year in the U.S. Each year thousands more would benefit from a heart transplant if more donated hearts were available. People who have advanced (end stage) heart failure, but are otherwise healthy, may be considered for a heart transplant. Can you adhere to the lifestyle changes, including complex drug treatments and frequent exams, required after a transplant? If you answered 'no' to any of the above questions, a heart transplant may not be for you. Also, if you have additional medical problems, such as other severe diseases, active infections, or severe obesity, you most likely will not be considered a candidate for transplant. In order to get a heart transplant, you must first be placed on a transplant list. But, before you can be placed on the transplant list, you must go through a careful screening process. A team of heart doctors, nurses, social workers, and bioethicists review your medical history, diagnostic test results, social history, and psychological test results to see if you are able to survive the procedure and then comply with the continuous care needed to live a long, healthy life. Donors for heart transplants are individuals who may have recently died or become brain dead, which means that although their body is being kept alive by machines, the brain has no sign of life. Many times, these donors died as a result of a car accident, severe head injury, or a gunshot wound. Donor organs are located through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computerized national waiting list. This waiting list assures equal access and fair distribution of organs when they become available. When a heart becomes available for transplantation, it is given to the best possible match, based on blood type, body size, UNOS status (based on the recipient's medical condition), and the length of time the recipient has been waiting. The race and gender of the donor have no bearing on the match. All donors are screened for Hepatitis B and C and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Unfortunately, not enough hearts are available for transplant. At any given time, almost 3,500 to 4,000 people are waiting for a heart or heart-lung transplant. A person may wait months for a transplant and more than 25% do\n\nWhen Petra Brosch’s heart stopped beating during a routine run on Elwood beach, it was the beginning of a journey that would see The Alfred’s specialists drawing on the latest in cutting-edge medicine to save her life.

Before she leaves, she encounters a patient reading a comic strip by Michael Kent. It was made possible by advanced life support technology, a dedicated and diverse surgical, respirology, intensive care and perfusion team, as well as the grit and gumption of the patient, Melissa Benoit, and her close-knit family. \"This was bold and very challenging, but Melissa was dying before our eyes,\" recalls Dr. Shaf Keshavjee, Surgeon-in-Chief, Sprott Department of Surgery at UHN, one of three thoracic surgeons who operated together on Melissa to remove both her lungs. \"Melissa gave us the courage to go ahead.\" For the past three years, Melissa, who has cystic fibrosis, had been prescribed antibiotics to fight off increasingly frequent chest infections. A recent bout of influenza just before her hospital admission had left Melissa gasping for air, with coughing fits so harsh that she fractured her ribs. As Dr. Niall Ferguson, Head of Critical Care Medicine at UHN and Mount Sinai Hospital, describes it, the influenza \"tipped her over the edge into respiratory failure. Her only hope of recovery was a lung transplant.\" Melissa's oxygen levels dipped so low, conventional ventilation was no longer enough. Despite this, Melissa's condition worsened. The bacteria in her lungs developed resistance to most antibiotics, and spread throughout her body. She slid into septic shock, triggering inflammation, leaky blood vessels and reduced blood flow. Melissa was now on maximum doses of three medications to maintain her blood pressure, along with the most advanced respiratory support, and on last-line powerful antibiotics, the last option for patients resistant to other available antibiotics. The team was still waiting for donor lungs but, by this time, Melissa was too sick to have a lung transplant. Removing both her lungs\n\nThis section of the Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN) website provides basic information to those waiting for an organ and tissue transplant and those that have received the gift of life.

Using electronic information and technology to support healthcare professionals to improve safety, quality and efficiency TGLN continues to grow the awareness and importance of organ and tissue donation and transplantation in the drive to save and enhance lives. There are hundreds of diseases that affect organs and tissues to the point that a transplant is required, but not everybody that suffers from disease requires one. Organs that can be transplanted are the liver, small bowel, kidney, pancreas, heart, and lung. This kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis. Transplanted livers can come from a deceased or living donor. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment options fail. Post surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Lung transplant surgery can replace one or both diseased lungs. Lungs can come from either a deceased or living donor. A transplant may be recommended if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases, or primary pulmonary hypertension, among others. As with other transplants, you must take medication to prevent your body from rejecting the new heart.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1,523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture. A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K (a vitamin necessary for bone health) and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional. Other therapies, such as estrogens (e.g., estradiol, conjugated estrogens), selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., raloxifene, bazedoxifene), and bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronic acid, risedronic acid), can also be used to improve or maintain bone density. Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to bone fragility, and consequent increase in fracture risk. Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis.

IGF-1, which contributes to muscle growth, also contributes to bone growth, and IGF-1 is modulated by protein intake. Large prospective cohort studies have shown a slight increase in risk of bone fracture when the quintile of highest protein consumption \n\nIndividuals around the country have experienced unexplained bone problems as a side effect of the osteoporosis drug Bondronat. Studies have shown that bisphosphonate medications like Bondronat may increase the risk of atypical femur fractures and a disfiguring jaw injury known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Bondronat Bone Fracture Update 5/24/12: In a study published this week by the Archives of Internal Medicine, Swiss researchers reached conclusions similar to those reached earlier this month by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) – that taking osteoporosis drugs from the bisphosphonate class can increase the risk of atypical bone fractures. Taken cumulatively, the results of the study seem to suggest that the risk of fractures increased over time while the benefits of the drugs decreased. Osteoporosis is a chronic debilitating disease that affects approximately 45 million people nationwide, typically affecting post-menopausal women by decreasing the density and strength of bones. If left untreated, osteoporosis can lead to severe fractures of the spine, hip and thigh. As the population of our nation continues to age, so too will the number of people suffering from the effects of osteoporosis continue to increase. Drugs from the bisphosphonate class are designed to bind tightly to tissue, thereby preventing calcium from being removed and sustaining bone density. However, he added, \"The fracture risk goes right back up once you stop it. Previous studies have found that women on tamoxifen have increased bone mineral density. And patients taking tamoxifen, compared to another class of breast cancer drugs, aromatase inhibitors, have a reduced risk of fracture. Current use of tamoxifen reduced osetoporosis-related fracture risk overall by 32 percent and reduced hip fractures by 53 percent. Breast cancer patients are known to be at increased risk for osteoporosis and all types of fractures because of the effects of chemotherapy and other drugs used to treat the disease. It is often used to treat patients with early stage breast cancer and those whose cancer has spread. They work by lowering the amount of estrogen in the body but have been associated with decreased bone density, upping fracture risk. \"We have known from large breast cancer trials comparing tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors that the fracture rates were higher in [those who got] aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen,\" she said. \"But we had not known whether the fracture rate on tamoxifen was lower than in women not being given tamoxifen and given nothing. Russell said the study results may cause some doctors to rethink when they prescribe tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On April 5 US President Barack Obama said he would veto any bill that prevented the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases. The EPA sought to repeal a regulation which required oil and gas companies to restrict emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The EPA granted a loophole allowing a small set of trucking companies to skirt emissions rules and produce glider trucks that emit 40 to 55 times the air pollutants of other new trucks. The EPA rejected a ban on the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos; a federal court then ordered the EPA to ban chlorpyrifos, because the EPA's own extensive research showed it \n\nFluorescent lamps have been suggested to affect human health in various ways.

Melanoma has been shown to not be affected by CFLs through normal use. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed.

The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000.\" The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been \n\n evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern.\" Scientists are looking into a link between women, diet sodas, and cardiovascular disease that is both problematic and shocking. The artificial sweeteners in diet sodas are causing people to gain weight. There is still a lot to be learned about how artificial sweeteners affect the human body. There have been some recent studies concerning women who drink diet drinks and how they affect their hearts as well as their weight. This could mean there is a possible link between the chemistry of diet soda in a woman’s metabolism and this is problematic as cardiovascular disease has come to the forefront concerning artificial sweeteners and it is shocking the power those chemicals truly contain. A Fellow in cardiovascular disease at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, as well as, head researcher for the study, Dr. Vyas, says that diet drinks can be linked to metabolic syndrome. Saccharin, Sucralose, and other artificial sweeteners are also linked to cancer. Aspartame can also be linked to lymphoma and leukemia. However, researchers cannot say with any amount of certainty that diet soda is directly linked to cardiovascular disease, only that there is an association between diet sodas and cardiovascular issues. This should prompt scientists to conduct more research. Women who drink diet sodas heavily could be more likely to experience blood clots and cardiovascular problems\n\nLinked Comment: Tsimihodimos et al. He was found to be profoundly hypokalaemic with a serum potassium level of 1.4 mmol ⁄ l. He had been drinking 4l of Coca-Cola per day over the past 3 years, and drank up to 10l to slake his thirst when he went for kangaroo-shooting at night. He was advised to curtail his cola drinking, and his potassium level normalised, his weakness resolved, and he made a full recovery (1). Over the course of 2 years, he had persistent hypokalaemia in the 2.7–3.3 mmol ⁄ l range and complained of ongoing generalised weakness and 2–3 loose stools per day. I asked him how much he drank, and he said that he sipped it continuously, 4l per day. He was not willing to stop drinking cola, but he did agree to reduce his intake to 2l per day. Sugar sweetened soft drinks have been shown to cause obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental decay and metabolic syndrome. They appear also to increase the risk for osteoporosis, gout, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, hypovitaminosis C, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The only therapeutic use of soft drinks is described in a few case reports of the successful use of Coca-Cola to dissolve phytobezoars. In their review of cola-induced hypokalaemia, Tsimihodimos et al. make a compelling argument that potassium depletion should be added to the long list of soft drink-related health problems. In the cases they describe, chronic consumption of 3–10l of sugar-sweetened cola per day led to severe hypokalaemia, hypokalaemic myopathy, and in some cases, hypokalaemic paralysis. One patient developed hypokalaemic nephropathy and subsequent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The results showed that less-educated single Black mothers were less likely to conceive during times of high unemployment. This raised the average health of Black babies. What was concluded from this investigation was that skill depreciation plays an important role in fertility decisions and that there are clear differences between Black and White mothers. Secondly, this paper expressed the importance of taking time off work in order to commit to prenatal care as the results show the behavioural change of pregnant women in times of unemployment. The study suggests that by increasing insulin, soft drinks could also increase the risk of cancer developing. Interestingly those who drank fruit juice, which is also high in sugar, didn’t have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. “The sugar load and resultant weight gain increases the risk of heart disease,” Jamieson says. “The effects on insulin levels, cholesterol, blood pressure and inflammation are also culprits.” As a guide, a can of regular soft drink contains about 41g of sugar. Women who consume three or more cola-based drinks a day have almost 4 per cent lower bone density than those who drink non-cola based drinks, thereby increasing their risk of osteoporosis, according to Tufts University in the US. The phosphoric acid in cola can leech calcium from bones, while “caffeine is known to be associated with the risk of lower bone mineral density”, Tucker added.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

FDA approved on 2 October 2018. • Lefamulin: pleuromutilin antibiotic. Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. In the US, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat \n\n growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\" A few antibiotics have received marketing authorization in the last seven years. The cephalosporin ceftaroline and the lipoglycopeptides oritavancin and telavancin for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. FDA approved on 19 December 2014. FDA approved on 25 February 2015. • Ceftaroline/avibactam (CPT-avibactam; ceftaroline/NXL104): Anti-MRSA cephalosporin/ β-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor). FDA approved on 29 August 2017. FDA approved on 19 June 2017. FDA approved 25 June \n\nFew deliberations have greater bearing on human health than when the Food and Drug Administration weighs the risks and benefits of drugs designed to treat life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. FDA physicians who specialize in treating cancer (oncologists), chemists, statisticians, microbiologists, pharmacologists, immunologists, and other experts work in concert to evaluate cancer drug data, weigh the risks and benefits, and reach a decision to approve or not approve. If the scale is tipped on the side of benefits, the drug is approved and allowed on the U.S. market. Patients, doctors, caregivers, and family members must also weigh the risks and benefits of drugs to decide which treatments to use. Cancer drugs are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. Under the acts, the FDA may approve a new drug for marketing in the United States if it is supported by substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness demonstrated in adequate and well-controlled studies. The drug's manufacturer or marketer must show this evidence by submitting an application to the FDA that includes results from studies of the drug's use in people (clinical trials). FDA oncologists and other agency experts review cancer drug applications and evaluate the study results. When seeking outside advice regarding drug approval or drug labeling. the FDA calls upon the expertise of a group of leading cancer specialists, clinical practitioners, and patient representatives who make up the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC). At an ODAC meeting, the pharmaceutical company presents findings from clinical trials on safety and effectiveness of the drug, and FDA staff present their assessments after reviewing the drug application, which includes extensive documentation about the drug's chemistry. its proposed use for one or more specific purposes, and data from clinical trials. The ODAC carefully considers the presentations and votes on questions posed by the FDA intended to guide the agency in its decision to approve or not approve the drug for marketing or for a new claim. the commercial sponsor may show that the drug works better than an inactive substance (placebo). but generally does not have to show that it works as well or better than other drugs on the market to treat the same illness. It is the third drug licensed specifically for use in treating the human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS. ddC is the first drug approved under the principles and procedures of FDA's proposed accelerated drug review policy, endorsed by the White House Council on Competitiveness and announced by the Vice President on April 9. The proposal also provides for prompt removal of the drug from the market if further review determines the therapy to be ineffective. In controlled clinical studies, 10 to 12 percent of patients discontinued treatment because of these complications. \"In this way, we can approve drugs that are both safe and effective as quickly as possible.\" The law also directs the FDA to focus its post market surveillance on higher risk devices, and allows the agency to implement a reporting system that concentrates on a representative sample of user facilities—such as hospitals and nursing homes—that experience deaths and serious illnesses or injuries linked with the use of devices. Finally, the law expands an ongoing pilot program under which the FDA accredits outside—so-called \"third party\"—experts to conduct the initial review of all low-to-intermediate risk class I and II devices. Who is a Candidate for Herceptin? What Have Clinical Trials with Tykerb Shown? In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President Barack Obama had been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms. On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order to implement the recommendations proposed in a report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&D of new antibiotics. Among the proposals: Scientists have started using advanced computational approaches with supercomputers for the development of new antibiotic derivatives to deal with antimicrobial resistance. by BICR and overall survival (OS).

Those with severe/progressive symptoms or those who do not experience symptom relief from medication have traditionally been considered for surgical intervention, with transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP as the standard of care. However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. A 2020 Cochrane review of studies involving men over 40 with enlarged prostates and lower urinary tract symptoms found that prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) may work similarly to common surgical options (transurethral resection of the prostate) to relieve symptoms and improve men's quality of life in the short term (up to a year). In the longer term (13–24 months), this review is very uncertain about the positive and negative effects of PAE in comparison with transurethral resection surgery. androgen deprivation therapy, and it should be used if a very quick reduction in testosterone levels is needed. Treatment is typically with a catheter either through the urethra or lower abdomen. Other treatments may include medication to decrease the size of the prostate, urethral dilation, a urethral stent, or surgery. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland. Complications can include urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and chronic kidney problems. The underlying mechanism involves the prostate pressing on the urethra thereby making it difficult to pass urine out of the bladder. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, a number of procedures, and surgery. In those with more significant symptoms, medications may include alpha blockers such as terazosin or 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride. Surgical removal of part of the prostate may be carried out in those who do not improve with other measures. Although prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated in males with BPH, the condition does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. This is supported by evidence suggesting that castrated boys\n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland.

Invasive therapies The two invasive surgical procedures done for BPH: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): In general prior to emergence of laser technologies, TURP had been considered the gold standard of prostate interventions for people who require a procedure. This involves removing (part of) the prostate by inserting a resectoscope (cystoscope) through the urethra. However, after this endoscopic surgery the ejaculations are dry in about 65% of patients, unless a novel, ejaculation preserving, altered technique of TURP is applied. Simple prostatectomy can also be offered to men who have large prostates (>50 grams). This can be done by open technique, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. There are two types of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the standard monopolar and the newer bipolar procedure. A 2019 Cochrane review of 59 studies that included 8924 men with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review found that bipolar and monopolar TURP probably results in comparable improvements urinary symptoms, as well as a similar erectile function, the incidence of urinary incontinence and the need for retreatment. Efforts to find newer surgical methods have resulted in newer approaches and different types of energies being used to treat the enlarged gland. However some of the newer methods for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, have not been around long enough to fully establish their safety or side-effects. Transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TVP), laser TURP, visual laser ablation (VLAP), ethanol injection, and others are studied as alternatives. Minimally invasive therapies Minimally invasive therapies can offer faster recovery compared with traditional prostate surgery. Prostate laser surgery Prostate laser surgery is used to relieve moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. The surgeon inserts a scope through the penis tip into the urethra. Different types of prostate laser surgery include: Visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP) technique involving the Nd:YAG laser with contact on the prostatic tissue. A laser is used to melt away (vaporize) excess prostate tissue and enlarge the urinary channel. It is used to vaporize the tissue to the prostatic capsule.

It was last used in 1944. In September 2020, Monash University Professor of Diabetes Paul Zimmet claimed that the switch to daylight saving time caused an increase in heart attacks, road accidents, workplace accidents, and cognitive dysfunction, and could amplify the health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews responded that daylight saving would be part of the forthcoming summer season. Daylight saving was widely believed to be introduced as a consumer spending initiative by local councils and tourism boards throughout New South Wales. Previous studies by a research group at the University of Geneva demonstrated a role for glucocorticoids in shifting the biological clock, and characterized this effect in the liver. For example, at some point in the time zone transition, your brain might be in the time zone of Sydney, Australia; your heart in Hawaii; and your liver still in Los Angeles. It is important to note that approximately 16 percent of the U.S. and European workforces undertake some form of shift work. However, while what we eat is important, a growing body of research suggests when we eat matters too. While you have likely heard of the circadian rhythm, the master \"clock\" in the brain that governs our sleep-wake cycle, we actually have a variety of circadian clocks that govern the daily cycle of activity for every organ. These rhythms exist because every organ needs downtime for repair and regeneration. Even our gut microbiome operates on a daily rhythm. Circadian clocks optimize our health by aligning our biological functions with regular and predictable environmental patterns. Disrupting our circadian clocks — such as by skipping breakfast or eating at midnight — can result in health issues such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and more. About 20 to 30 percent of American adults skip breakfast. Some do it to save time, many do it in an effort to lose weight. However, studies show that people who eat breakfast daily are less likely to be obese, malnourished, suffer from impaired blood sugar metabolism, or be diagnosed with diabetes. They are also less likely to have the heart disease risk factors of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Even the American Heart Association recently endorsed biologically appropriate meal timing to reduce the risk of heart disease. Just eating breakfast isn't the only important thing however. The timing in relation to the size of our meals is also important. This is partially because insulin, a hormone that helps with blood sugar control, appears to be most efficient in the morning. In addition, we burn more calories and digest food more efficiently in the morning than later in the day when most of us eat our largest meal.

However, a new study on how the time of day affects autoimmune symptoms could offer new ways of treating this complex and increasingly common group of diseases. According to new research, there may be ties to the body’s internal clocks that have a huge impact on severity of both symptoms and the disease itself. Our immune system bases its activity partially on our internal clocks, so it is no surprise that autoimmune diseases do so as well. Could Molecular Clocks Contribute to Autoimmune Disease? This is not the first study to find that internal clocks are linked to both risk and severity of autoimmune disease. In fact, there is a new field called chronoimmunology dedicated to the study of how immune systems affect and are affected by timing and clocks. Previous studies have found that young adults who work odd shifts, for example, have a higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease later in life. A study of the life habits of 276 subjects over a 6-year period and found that about 20% of those with long (9+ hours) of sleeping time developed type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance as compared to 7% in those that slept an average amount of time.

A new global guideline on chronic urticaria (CU) recommends Xolair® (omalizumab), indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), for patients who are not responding to antihistamines,. Xolair is the only licensed treatment option for CSU, a type of CU, for patients unresponsive to antihistamines. The guideline recommends Xolair as the only treatment qualified with very good efficacy and very good safety in CSU. Marcus Maurer, MD, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy and Director of Research at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany said: \"I highly welcome the new guideline, as it brings greater public awareness of the disease and treatment. \"This guideline is encouraging news for CSU patients who have difficult to control symptoms,\" said Shreeram Aradhye MD, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \"The recommendation reinforces the important role of Xolair to provide effective symptom control in CSU when antihistamines prove inadequate. Xolair is the only biologic shown to be effective in CSU.\" Patients treated with Xolair for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements in quality of life by 78% (vs placebo 44%, p<0.0001) as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Also, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma. Xolair is a targeted therapy that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE). In allergic diseases and asthma, the binding of IgE by Xolair reduces\n\nXolair is the First Biologic Medicine Approved for CIU, a Burdensome Skin Condition that Can Cause Hives and Severe Itch and May Last Many Years. Nearly 50 Percent of Patients Have Inadequate Response to H1-antihistamines, Previously the Only Approved Therapy for CIU3. Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xolair(R) (omalizumab) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a form of chronic hives. Until now, H(1) -antihistamines have been the only approved therapy for CIU, with about 50 percent of patients having an inadequate response(3) . Xolair is the first biologic medicine and first medicine approved by the FDA for CIU since non-sedating H(1) -antihistamines. Xolair is approved for people 12 years and older with CIU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Xolair is not used to treat other forms of urticaria (hives) and is not for use in children less than 12 years of age. It is jointly developed by Genentech and Novartis Pharma AG and is co-promoted in the U.S. with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The efficacy and safety profile of Xolair for the treatment of CIU was evaluated in two clinical studies called ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II(5) . Xolair or placebo was given every four weeks for 24 weeks (ASTERIA I) and 12 weeks (ASTERIA II). In addition, patients continued to receive H(1) -antihistamine medicines they had been taking for CIU before starting treatment with Xolair(5) . The efficacy of Xolair in patients 12 years and older who remained symptomatic despite taking H(1) -antihistamines was assessed using a scale known as the average (mean) weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS) at Week 12. In ASTERIA I, Xolair 150 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 47 percent (-6.7) and Xolair 300 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 66 percent (-9.4) at Week 12, compared to a 25 percent (-3.6) score improvement for patients who received placebo(5) . Also, a larger proportion of patients (36 percent) treated with Xolair 300 mg reported no itch and no hives at Week 12, compared to patients treated with Xolair 150 mg (15 percent), and patients in the\n\n Itching, rash, pruritus. A drug already used to treat moderate-to-severe allergic asthma appears to offer relief to people with chronic hives who haven't been helped by standard medications, new research suggests. The prescription drug -- omalizumab (Xolair) -- is already available to treat hives, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year for that use. \"And until now antihistamines have been the only approved drug for chronic hives. So then we would turn to the heavy artillery, like [the immunosuppressant drug] cyclosporine, which also has very severe side effects, and can't be taken by people with high blood pressure or heart disease.\" \"But with this drug we are seeing great improvement in patients who previously had no options. The current study is the latest in a series of ongoing studies, which are being funded by drug manufacturer Genentech Inc. and Novartis Pharma AG in Basel Switzerland. The team found that by the 12th week, people given Xolair showed a marked reduction in their overall number of hives, hive intensity and itching severity, compared with patients who got the dummy treatment. Symptom relief was maintained through the six-month mark, and the authors determined that those treated with the highest (300 mg) dosage of Xolair saw the biggest improvement.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20 mg/kg a day compared to placebo. Female cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), thought to be the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis; and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, \"It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine.\" Acetone has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects in animal models of epilepsy, in the absence of toxicity, when administered in millimolar concentrations. It has been hypothesized that the high-fat low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet used clinically to control drug-resistant epilepsy in children works by elevating acetone in the brain. Some of these adults and parents, as well as medical researchers and physicians, are finding new hope in the use of cannabidiol, or CBD, for reducing the frequency and severity of seizures. It also has significant pain relief, anti-inflammatory, and anti-anxiety properties, which offer a wide range of possible medicinal applications. CBD is usually administered orally in oil form to control seizures and can be given as drops under the tongue or mixed with food. Medical cannabis, a type of marijuana that contains both THC and CBD, has been used successfully to control seizures. Several states have approved the use of medical marijuana for epilepsy, but research is showing that CBD may be more effective than THC at reducing seizure activity. Some types of medical marijuana are low-THC and high-CBD, meaning that they have less of the intoxicating component that causes a “high” and more potentially beneficial CBD. More research is needed to understand exactly how CBD affects the brain, but researchers believe that CBD may control seizures by calming the brain’s abnormal electrical activity and chemical processes. Animal studies have shown that CBD has an anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effect, which means that it shows promise as a preventative treatment for epilepsy in humans. Although research into the possible applications of CBD for epilepsy treatment is encouraging and ongoing, some parents of children who have epilepsy are not waiting for further research results. Many parents with children who have severe, uncontrolled epilepsy are giving their children CBD now — and some are reporting life-changing results. Scientific researchers have conducted several controlled studies on CBD, meaning that study participants were divided into two or more groups for comparison. One group received a placebo (or a harmless substance that has no therapeutic effect), and the other group received the medication. An open-label study of an oral CBD solution found that of the median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 35.6 percent during the 12-week study. ; Stiripentol with clonazepam has mitigated seizures in some cases. ; Intravenous levetiracetam has shown to interrupt seizures in a few cases ; Combination of the above three have shown significant therapeutic response ; Rufinamide has shown potential efficacy ; Acetazolamide has shown potential efficacy MMPSI is generally resistant to treatment with seizure medications. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved a drug called Epidiolex which contains cannabidiol (CBD). On the website of the producer, a biopharmaceutical company GW Pharmaceuticals dealing with the discovery, development, and commercialization of new drugs, Epidiolex is the first (available by medical prescription) pharmaceutical formulation containing a high content of purified cannabidiol (CBD) of plant origin that does not cause intoxicating. “The approval of Epidiolex is a milestone in the use of a cannabidiol for the treatment of neurological disorders. This is the first and so far the only CBD drug that can be used to treat two types of epilepsy in children. Patients deserve it and soon will have access to a CBD-containing drug that has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials, meets all the pharmaceutical product quality criteria and will be available as a prescription from a doctor “ – Justin Gover. “In my medical practice, I had many patients who suffered from drug-resistant epilepsy. In such patients, the treatment regimens used so far most often did not bring the expected results, which is why these patients often asked about the possibility of using CBD “ – said Dr. Orrin Devinsky of the Epileptic Treatment Center at NYU Langone Health, and also one of the main clinical trial managers of Epidiolex. This drug supplements a specific pharmacological gap dedicated to a specific population of pediatric patients and is now the first that\n\n TEA responds well to low doses of medicine used to treat epilepsy, (such as carbamazepine, lamotrigine or sodium valproate) resulting in a cessation of seizure activity in 45 of 47 patients. that mild stimulation of the endocannabinoid system (CB1 and CB2) in infancy and adolescence, appears to normalize many reproductive processes and prevent infertility in CF males. As NAE related Cannabis has an ancient tradition of usage as a medicine in obstetrics and gynecology, its extracts, may represent an efficacious and safe alternative for treatment of a wide range of conditions in women including dysmenorrhea, dysuria, hyperemesis gravidarum, and \n\n In 2015, GW Pharmaceutical initiated Phase 3 clinical trials of cannabidiol oral solution for treatment of two rare disease in children – Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. With the recent approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome, providers and patients have an additional therapeutic option to consider. Cannabis has been used for over 4,000 years with varied success to treat ailments including chronic pain, eating disorders, rheumatism, and convulsions. In the 19th century, neurologists noted the potential effectiveness of cannabis for treating seizure disorders.34 Research since has continued to evaluate cannabis as a treatment option for epilepsy. Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials found significant improvement of seizure control when patients were treated with CBD in addition to their standard epilepsy treatment. Children and adults with DS and refractory seizures receiving CBD (20 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks exhibited a 52% reduction in seizure frequency compared to a modest 5% reduction with placebo (P = .01).38 In fact, 5% of these patients in the treatment group were seizure-free (P = .08).38 Similarly, in another study, addition of CBD (20 mg/kg) in patients with LGS and other refractory seizures resulted in a 43.9% median reduction of drop seizures in comparison with a 21.8% reduction with placebo addition.39 A third trial evaluating CBD in patients on standard epilepsy treatment showed 41.9% and 37.2% reduction in drop seizure frequencies over a 14-week treatment period with doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg twice a day, respectively, compared with 17.2% in the placebo group. In these studies, adverse effects noted included decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and abnormal liver-function tests.38-40 Drug interactions that may require monitoring and dose adjustment included valproic acid and clobazam.38-40 These results highlight the potential of cannabidiol as an adjunctive treatment for DS, LGS, and other refractory seizures.

The outbreak was declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and a pandemic on March 11. As a result, travel restrictions, social distancing measures, and many other precautions have been taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 while many vaccines are undergoing phased distribution in most countries.

Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in \n\n The virus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. It was first detected in December 2019, which is why scientists called it COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This outbreak has since caused a health issue in the city of Wuhan, China which evolved into a global pandemic. The World Health Organization officially declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 2020, scientists believe that COVID-19, a zoonotic disease, is linked to the wet markets in China. Specialists have declared that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown. The generally accepted notion among \n\n On December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak.

Since 2005, he has repeatedly referred to physician and abortion doctor George Tiller as \"Tiller the baby killer\" on his Fox News prime time show, claiming that there must be \"a special place in hell\" for him. In May 2009, Tiller was murdered by anti-abortion radical Christian terrorist Scott Roeder. O'Reilly ardently condemns the practice of partial birth abortion. He has criticized the practice being done without explanations being made and has criticized human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for not condemning the practice: \"Once again, this isn't about a women's [sic] right to choose or the New York Times plea for reproductive rights. This is about late term abortions for just about any reason.\" In 2018, he said regarding the term pro-life, which is used to describe those who are against abortions as, \"I’m also calling bullshit on the idea that opposing abortion makes you pro-life...If you just want to keep working class women from making their own decisions, you might be pro-birth but you’re not pro-life.\" In 2016, Ojeda described himself as \"pro-life, with exceptions\". “I’ve always said that I’m pro-life,” he told WCHS during the campaign, “but I also, being someone who almost lost my wife and child during child birth, I think it’s also important in certain circumstances that the mother have the ability to choose her life.”\n\n Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing.

In the only election debate he attended, where he joined Democrat James Thompson, and the campaign manager for Libertarian candidate Chris Rockhold, he repeated the claim that Planned Parenthood had been profiting by selling parts of aborted fetuses. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states.Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts.The law stipulates that abortion clinics can be reimbursed only for costs when they provide fetal tissue for research. For some, the use of cells from Mrs. X's fetus will continue to be an abomination, no matter how long ago the abortion was and no matter that it would have happened anyway. In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives.

The Trump administration is seeking alternatives to aborted fetuses for vaccine and virus researchers, but National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins recently backed such research. WASHINGTON — Scientists and politicians are clashing over the value of using “humanized mice” implanted with tissue harvested from aborted babies’ organs in ongoing federally funded research. By contrast, a leading stem-cell researcher last week told a congressional hearing considering axing about $100 million in federal grants to scientists performing research with fetal remains that using tissue from aborted babies is “antiquated” and unnecessary. Prentice described the case of Allison Carr, a multiple sclerosis patient whose doctors told her she would be completely disabled and on a feeding tube within five years. The cell lines she is referring to — MRC-5 and WI-38 — propagated from lung tissue of mature aborted fetuses, are used in the current manufacture of a number of routine vaccines,\n\nThe recommendation to stop funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood by the House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel holds significance from both a political and ethical standpoint. This recommendation aligns with the stance of Republicans who have long sought to block funding for Planned Parenthood due to their provision of abortions, along with birth control and preventive health services. The investigation was prompted by undercover videos released in 2015, where anti-abortion activists posed as biotechnology executives and interviewed senior physicians from Planned Parenthood. Therefore, the recommendation to cease funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood raises important questions regarding the future of medical research and the potential impact on the development of new treatments.

This new protocol revises the planned analyses of the primary and several secondary endpoints, reducing the target patient population to 1440 patients, down from 1560. The FDA approved enzalutamide in 2012 as a treatment for men with late-stage CRPC previously treated with docetaxel. In 2014, the agency approved the drug for first-line therapy based on results from the phase III PREVAIL trial, in which enzalutamide improved OS by 29% and radiographic progression-free survival by 81% compared with placebo. The FDA expanded enzalutamide’s label again in 2016 based on findings from the phase II TERRAIN trial, in which enzalutamide reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 40% versus bicalutamide, and improved median rPFS by 6.1 months in patients with metastatic CRPC.

The trial was evaluating MM-121 in combination with docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug, in patients with heregulin positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The SHERLOC study enrolled 109 patients with NSCLC. Objective response rate (ORR), time to progression and overall survival were key secondary endpoints. The patients need to have progressed after one or two lines of prior systemic therapies for metastatic or locally advanced disease and have received previous CDK inhibitor-based therapy. Key secondary endpoints are objective response rate, time to progression and overall survival. The data were presented today at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. NLG2101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of indoximod 1200 mg orally, twice daily in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly in patients with metastatic ER/PR positive or negative, HER2 negative breast cancer. The trial, which reached its goal of 154 patients enrolled across multiple sites in the United States and Europe, is designed to evaluate the combination of indoximod and chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study's primary endpoint is progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of overall survival, response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria, safety, and immune response correlative assays. Preliminary evaluable safety data from 128 patients, when considered in a blinded fashion pooling control and treatments arms of the study, suggests that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Additionally, no unexpected safety signals were reported with the combination of indoximod with docetaxel or paclitaxel, suggesting that there is no additional or unique toxicity with the addition of indoximod to chemotherapy. Objective responses were achieved in an earlier Phase 1 trial combining indoximod and docetaxel in patients with metastatic solid tumors, including breast tumors. \"I believe this is an exciting chemoimmunotherapy combination regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\" said Shou-Ching Tang, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Leader, Breast Cancer Multidisciplinary Team at Augusta University. The data, presented during the poster session \"Treatment: Immunotherapy,\" correspond to the abstract (P2-11-09) entitled, \"A phase 2 randomized trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod in combination with taxane based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: preliminary data.\" Indoximod is an orally available small molecule that has shown the potential to interfere with multiple targets within the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway.

A Phase I clinical trial was conducted in Japanese patients in September 2010, followed by a Phase II trial in 133 patients, starting in October 2010. A Phase III trial completed in 2019, and unfortunately showed no benefit from the addition of olaratumab to doxorubicin.

It is also easy to use an MP3 player or iPod to play songs for practice or for looping those parts to target technique issues or replicate drum parts. ; Electronic drums do not require complex and expensive microphones or their large stand arrangements for recording, unlike acoustic drums. Because of this, an electronic drum is good for education, practice, composition applications. In popular use, beat can refer to a variety of related concepts, including pulse, tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove. There are three evidence-based benefits of group drumming that apply to treating veterans. Drumming is a complex composite intervention with the potential to modulate specific neuroendocrine and neuroimmune parameters in a direction opposite to that expected with the classic stress response. \"I once worked with a young person with Parkinson's disease who had trouble initiating movement. Drumming is a great workout for your brain and actually can make you smarter because when you drum you access your entire brain. Drumming can have positive effects on your health and may help with many conditions from stress, fatigue, and anxiety, to hypertension, asthma, chronic pain, arthritis, mental illness, addiction, and even cancer. •Barry Bittman, MD, CEO, Mind-Body Wellness Center \"Group drumming from a HealthRHYTHMS perspective is transcendent ... it empowers people to more effectively express themselves, while enabling them to move beyond their perceived limitations and put back into their lives what is missing.\" Jeffrey Ritterman, MD, Kaiser Permanente – \"Many of our patients are socially isolated and the drumming sessions help them feel connected with each other. I would recommend the HealthRHYTHMS protocol to health care providers working with patients in a variety of settings. Group drumming sessions using the HealthRHYTHMS protocol can help this process tremendously.\" Can Drumming Protect the Aging Brain? Here's how drumming can help solve the problem.

You actually learn how to control its movement through the stability of your core muscles. In Pilates, the quality of movement is valued over quantity of repetitions. Some exercises are so precise and controlled doing only a few are all that is needed. Modification to the exercises is key here. Strengthening postural muscles is a key component in Pilates exercises. Most of us know good posture when we see it, and we are inspired by how free and strong it makes a person look, but there are so many reasons to work on your posture that go beyond appearance. Sports performance is greatly improved because Pilates builds balanced muscle development, core strength, and flexibility through efficient and purposeful movement. Many conventional workouts practiced by athletes build strength and mass in specific muscle groups but ignore others. The result is muscular imbalance – a primary cause of injury and deteriorating athletic performance. In Pilates, no one muscle group is overly trained. You will learn how to move efficiently–Pilates exercises train several muscle groups at once in smooth, continuous movements. Many of the exercises are performed in reclining or sitting positions, yet are weight bearing to reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis. Pilates is so safe, it is used in physical therapy facilities to rehabilitate injuries. It is also an extremely flexible exercise system. Modifications to the exercises allow for a range of difficulty from beginners, those post-rehab, all the way to advanced practitioners. At each of these levels, the workout is modified to suit you now, and intensity increases as your body conditioning improve.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to Emil Adolf von Behring, of Germany.

As of 2009, 8 Prizes have been awarded for contributions in the field of signal transduction by \n\nThe Energy Transition prize was awarded to James A. Dumesic, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,for developing catalytic processes for converting biomass fuels and chemical products. ; The Advanced Environmental Solutions prize was awarded to Paul Chirik, of Princeton University, for his research in the field of catalysis. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Given almost any substance, it is possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to that substance; they can then serve to detect or purify that substance. This has become an important tool in biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. The idea of \"magic bullets\" was first proposed by Paul Ehrlich, who, at the beginning of the 20th century, postulated that, if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. He and Élie Metchnikoff received the 1908 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this work, which led to an effective syphilis treatment by 1910. While working at the Institute of Experimental Therapy, Ehrlich formed an idea that it could be possible to kill specific microbes that cause diseases without harming the body itself. He named the hypothetical agent as Zauberkugel, the magic bullet. He envisioned that just like a bullet fired from a gun to hit a specific target, there could be a way to specifically target invading microbes. His continued research to discover the magic bullet resulted in further knowledge of the functions of the body's immune system, and in the development of Salvarsan, the first effective drug for syphilis, in 1909. His works were the foundation of immunology, and for his contributions he shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Élie Metchnikoff. He invented the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 2018. These enzymes today are a fundamental tool for many different types of biotechnology, including DNA sequencing and gene cloning. (Photo credit: Anne-Katrin Purkiss, Wellcome Images B0007461). This they did by combining a gene for frog ribosomal RNA with a bacterial plasmid which was then put into a strain of E-coli for expression. Based on this technique Boyer helped found Genentech, the first biotechnology company dedicated to commercialising recombinant DNA. This he did in 1976 in collaboration with Robert Swanson. This they did by combining a gene for frog ribosomal RNA with a bacterial plasmid which was then put into a strain of E-coli for expression. The work laid the foundation for the birth of Genentech, the first company dedicated to the commercialisation of recombinant DNA.

Haroche was born 1944 in Casablanca, Morocco, and in 1971 gained a PhD from Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris. He shares half of the prize for developing a new field called cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) – whereby the properties of an atom are controlled by placing it in an optical or microwave cavity. In a series of ground-breaking experiments, Haroche used CQED to realize Schrödinger's famous cat experiment in which a system is in a superposition of two very different quantum states until a measurement is made on the system. ; 2011 Christopher Isham (Imperial College London) For his major contributions to the search for a consistent quantum theory of gravity and to the foundations of quantum mechanics. ; 2012 Graham Garland Ross (University of Oxford) For his theoretical work in developing both the Standard Model of fundamental particles and forces and theories beyond the Standard Model that have led to many new insights into the origins and nature of the universe. ; 2014 Tim Palmer (University of Oxford) For \n\n development of probabilistic weather and climate prediction systems. ; 2015 John Barrow (University of Cambridge) For his combination of mathematical and physical reasoning to increase our understanding of the evolution of the universe, and his use of cosmology to increase our understanding of fundamental physics. ; 2016 Sandu Popescu (University of Bristol) For his fundamental and influential research into nonlocality and his contribution to the foundations of quantum physics. ; 2017 Michael Duff (Imperial College London and Oxford University) For sustained groundbreaking contributions to theoretical physics including the discovery of Weyl anomalies, for having pioneered Kaluza-Klein supergravity, and for recognising that superstrings in 10 dimensions are merely a special \n\n1990 Davisson-Germer Prize in Atomic or Surface Physics ; 1990 William F.

Post Secondary institutions historically viewed disability from the lens of the medical model, whether it is curable or incurable by medicine. Refitting institutional design to this view is a result \n\n The reactions to Brown's removal of the press release from its website included criticism by Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School. \"The fact that Brown University deleted its initial promotional reference to Dr. Littman’s work from the university’s website—then replaced it with a note explaining how Dr Littman’s work might harm members of the transgender community—presents a cautionary tale.

From Medscape.com How Medical Schools Can Meet Mental Health Needs of Students - Medscape - Oct 03, 2018. Medical students have higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout compared with the general population, as well as greater concerns about the stigma of mental illness, write Jordan F. Karp, MD, and Arthur S.

As a legislator, she advocated for a variety of issues protecting free speech, including the Campus Anti-Harassment Act and Campus Free Expression Act. Her work protecting campus free speech earned her the Legislator of the Month award from the American Legislative Exchange Council, which wrote, \"100% of college students deal with free speech issues on campus. Enshrining and educating on first amendment principles will guarantee a college is protected against those who would promote chaos instead of debate.\" Overturning the Obama administration's \"zero tolerance\" policies regarding sexual assault on campus, Coleman advanced the Student Right to Active Counsel, which requires institutions of higher education to allow accused parties to have legal representation at disciplinary proceedings. She also successfully advocated for a \"Know Before You Go\" bill, which requires colleges to inform prospective students about the debt they will accrue relative to their post-graduation financial prospects. The equivalent of 2 full-time psychiatric physicians serve as consultants to providers at both CAPS and Student Health Services (SHS). When time permits, psychiatrists also provide specialty mental-health consultation, education and collaboration regarding students to Student Affairs staff, including Residential and Academic Deans. CAPS psychiatrists do not initiate nor continue prescriptions for psycho-stimulant medications. Psychiatrists may provide individual services to individuals who are undergraduate, graduate and professional school students at UCSD, who have paid their current student services fees. Given the ratio of one psychiatrist for approximately 18,000 students, we ask students and families to utilize these services responsibly, for the well-being of individual students and the community at large. For instance, students who transition to UCSD and require ongoing psychiatric medication management need to plan ahead. Please discuss options with your current, treating psychiatrist and devise a plan that insures you do not run out of your medication and thereby risk relapse. The demand for these documents has reduced the availability of appointment for students who are seeking counseling services. CAPS Services Documentation Forms may be provided, at the discretion of your psychologist, at follow-up counseling appointments only. An additional reason for this policy is that documentation is of limited accuracy when it is based on only a\n\nProviding academic accommodations for students with mental illness in postsecondary education is significant for several reasons. First and foremost, it ensures equal access to education for all students, regardless of their mental health condition. By providing reasonable accommodations, postsecondary institutions can create an inclusive environment that supports the success and well-being of students with mental illness. Accommodations such as extended time for exams, modified attendance policies, or flexibility in assignment deadlines can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by students with mental illness. These accommodations acknowledge that individuals with mental health conditions may experience periods of heightened symptoms or difficulty managing their daily lives, and provide the necessary support to help them navigate their academic journey. Moreover, academic accommodations can contribute to the overall mental well-being of students with mental illness. Importantly, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness is not just a matter of fairness, but also a legal obligation. The American Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and its 2008 amendments mandate that students with psychiatric disabilities be provided with reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. By complying with these legal requirements, postsecondary institutions can prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities for students with mental illness. In summary, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness in postsecondary education is significant because it ensures equal access to education, supports mental well-being, improves academic performance, and fulfills legal obligations.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

All women of childbearing age are offered pregnancy testing, as some of them do not know they are carrying a child until many months into pregnancy. The clinic invests significant effort into counseling pregnant women, and providing prenatal care and vitamins. ; A predictive model using blinded ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) at 36 weeks, maternal age, height, BMI and weight gain correctly identifies women at increased risk of emergency C-section: in this study 48% of screen-positive women delivered by C-section. This method is safe for the fetus since it only requires a peripheral blood sample from the mother and has been used to map maternal immune development throughout normal pregnancies as well as studying the relationship between immune activation and pregnancy complications or abnormal development of the fetus. The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus. The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks' and 22 weeks' gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, \n\n The first form of any kind of parental testing was blood typing, or matching blood types between the child and alleged parent, which became available in the 1920s, after scientists recognized that blood types, which had been discovered in the early 1900s, were genetically inherited. Under this form of testing, the blood types of the child and parents are compared, and it can be determined whether there is any possibility of a parental link. This often led to inconclusive results, as 30% of the entire population can be excluded from being the possible parent \n\nPrenatal care, also known as antenatal care, is a type of preventive healthcare. It is provided in the form of medical checkups, consisting of recommendations on managing a healthy lifestyle and the provision of medical information such as maternal physiological changes in pregnancy, biological changes, and prenatal nutrition including prenatal vitamins, which prevents potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy and promotes the mother and child's health alike.The availability of routine prenatal care, including prenatal screening and diagnosis, has played a part in reducing the frequency of maternal death, miscarriages, birth defects, low birth weight, neonatal infections and other preventable health problems.

It has demonstrated its effectiveness for plaque psoriasis in phase III, randomized, controlled trials in comparison to placebo and to etanercept. Approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of psoriasis was rejected by the FDA due to safety concerns. It has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis in phase III studies. It is being studied for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and other immunological diseases, as well as for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Biotechnology complained that they were \"shocked\" and \"disappointed\" at the $2,055 a month wholesale price. A 2014 study showed that tofacitinib treatment was able to convert white fat tissues into more metabolically active brown fat, suggesting it may have potential applications in the treatment of obesity. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib \"to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate. The FDA approved only the five-mg, twice-daily dose on the grounds that a higher dose was not considered to have an adequate risk-to-benefit ratio. Tofacitinib, sold under the brand Xeljanz among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. An important side effect of Jakinibs is serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. It is in the janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor class, discovered and developed by the National Institutes of Health and Pfizer. The potential significance of JAK3 inhibition was first discovered in the laboratory of John O'Shea, an immunologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The drug was coded as CP-690,550 during development. Its original recommended INN (rINN) was tasocitinib, but that was overruled during the INN approval process as being not optimally differentiable from other existing INNs, so the name \"tofacitinib\" was proposed and became the INN. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. An outbreak of cholera subsequently ensued with 517 confirmed cases in the Beira area between 24 and 31 March. The number of confirmed cases exceeded 1,500 by 3 April. By 10 April, 4,072 confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities. The crowded and poor neighborhoods of the city were at greatest risk for continued spread of \n\n dehydration, and vomiting Dehydration poses the biggest health risk to pregnant women in countries that there are high rates of cholera. In cases of cholera gravis involving severe dehydration, up to 60% of patients can die; however, less than 1% of cases treated with rehydration therapy are fatal. Worldwide, diarrhoeal disease, caused by cholera and many other pathogens, is the second-leading cause of death for children under the age of 5 and at least 120,000 deaths are estimated to be caused by cholera each year. In 2002, the WHO deemed that the case fatality ratio for cholera was about 3.95%. V. cholerae has an endemic or epidemic occurrence. In countries where the disease has been for the past three years and the cases confirmed are local (within the confines of the country) transmission is considered to be \"endemic.\" Additionally, countries that have an occurrence of an epidemic can also be endemic. The longest standing V. chloerae epidemic was recorded in Yemen. The epidemic in Yemen took over 2,500 lives and impacted over 1 million people of Yemen More outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Americas, and Haiti. created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunisation, a proper dealing with measles cases, national campaigns, introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles. The outbreak began in the capital, Luanda, and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces. The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable. Médecins Sans Frontières reported at least 200 presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. An increase in the incidence of malaria was noted, attributed to malarial mosquitoes breeding in the stagnant water. Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700 cases of diarrhoea by 26 March. The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks \n\nCholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice. Cholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000 deaths a year. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology.

It may also be used to decrease the risk of HIV transmission by an HIV-positive male, in which case the washed sperm is injected into a female using an artificial insemination technique. Sperm washing is a standard procedure in infertility treatment. Once the fastest sperm have been isolated, before using them for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, it is important to confirm the absence of HIV virus in the sample. there is no virus, this sample is suitable for use in assisted reproduction treatments. Laboratory testing of substances to see if they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s. Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 Comstock Act, spermicides—the most popular of which was Lysol—were marketed only as \"feminine hygiene\" products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness. Medical estimates during the \n\n Sperm washing takes place in a laboratory following sperm donation. In normal semen samples, centrifugation causes no more DNA damage to spermatozoa than a direct swim-up technique. The presence of anti-sperm antibodies in infertile men was first reported in 1954 by Rumke and Wilson. It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility. Anti sperm antigen has been described as three immunoglobulin isotopes (IgG, IgA, IgM) each of which targets different part of the spermatozoa. If more than 10% of the sperm are bound to anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), then infertility is suspected. The blood-testis barrier separates the immune system and the developing spermatozoa. Infertility after anti-sperm antibody binding can be caused by autoagglutination, sperm cytotoxicity, blockage of sperm-ovum interaction, and inadequate motility. There is evidence suggesting a significant association between vitamin D serum concentrations and the quality of sperm in men, characterized by the sperm's motility and progress motility. Because the quality of men's sperm is influenced by genetics, results should be interpreted cautiously. There is little evidence that supplementation with antioxidants, such as pentoxifylline will increase male fertility. Male infertility refers to a sexually mature male's inability to impregnate a fertile female. In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Causes Factors relating to male infertility include: Immune infertility Antisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. Genetics Chromosomal anomalies and genetic mutations account for nearly 10–15% of all male infertility cases. Klinefelter syndrome One of the most commonly known causes of infertility is Klinefelter syndrome, affecting 1 out of 500–1000 newborn males Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal defect that occurs during gamete formation due to a non-disjunction error during cell division. Y chromosome deletions Y chromosomal infertility is a direct cause of male infertility due to its effects on sperm production, occurring in 1 out of every 2000 males.

In short, critical gaps exist in the literature, with a paucity of prospective, controlled studies on late-life outcomes and neurodegeneration after mTBI and related basic science research. The existing research, although suggestive, is not rigorous or robust enough to allow for a clear understanding of the relationships, risks, and potential effective interventions for mTBI, chronic symptoms, and neurodegeneration. To date, no controlled prospective longitudinal study has examined the late-life cognitive, behavioral, systemic, and functional effects of TBI of any severity. Given the absence of prospective studies, the association between TBI and early neurodegeneration is merely theoretical, and the actual \n\n factors and rate/extent of physiologic and clinical decline over time are unknown. It is also unclear whether a single TBI may be enough to begin a degenerative cascade in select individuals or whether a critical number (dose threshold) of TBIs is needed to “prime” the central nervous system for degeneration. The potential link between mTBI and the development of early dementia is a significant concern for not only at-risk SMs, Veterans, and their families, but also for DoD and VA resource planning, given the \n\nA new study has revealed a startlingly high number of former football players had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) at the time of their deaths, including 110 of 111 NFL players tested. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with head trauma. Simply put, it causes damage to brain cells that results in cell death and worsens over time. But as it develops, CTE can lead to worsening dementia and death. It was first identified in boxers in the 1920s as “punch-drunk” dementia and then “dementia pugilistica,” and its underlying pathology was described in 1973. Because of this, CTE may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s and FTD, though research has not yet confirmed this. Since 1973, CTE has been diagnosed in boxers, wrestlers, military veterans, and baseball, football, ice hockey, rugby, and soccer players. A 2015 report on the brain health risks of youth sports co-sponsored by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) also found that children who played contact sports were at risk of developing CTE later in life. But efforts are underway to develop diagnostic tools for living patients. The ADDF is funding Sam Gandy, MD, PhD, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai for one such project. Dr. Gandy is using 18F-AV-1451, a PET imaging agent being developed by Avid Pharmaceuticals, to try to image tau tangles and threads in the brains of people who have sustained multiple head injuries. It could also be used to assess CTE risk in younger players by detecting the presence of tau in the brain after a head injury. The Center focuses on research related to the long-term effects of brain trauma and degenerative brain diseases, specializing in the diagnosis and analysis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). According to researchers at Boston University, CTE is a brain disease involving progressive neurological deterioration common in athletes, military personnel, and others who have a history of brain trauma. Symptoms from CTE do not typically appear in a subject until many years after the initial injuries, and a conclusive diagnosis of the disease can only be achieved through autopsy. Although CTE remains mysterious and controversial, researchers have observed a link between the disease and the protein called tau, which slowly forms clumps in the brain that kill brain cells. This often results in subjects experiencing depression, anxiety, memory loss, headaches, and sleep disturbances.

Researchers have also used the autopsy data to determine that there is a \n\nI thought it made sense to publish most of the press release that Boston University put out this week about the extensive study it did on the brains of many deceased athletes and soldiers. The research found that they were suffering from the progressive degenerative brain disease that’s been linked to repeated head trauma. This landmark research was done by investigators at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) and the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, in collaboration with the Sports Legacy Institute (SLI). The study described 68 cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among deceased athletes and military veterans whose brain and spinal cords were donated to the VA CSTE Brain Bank. Dr. Ann McKee, professor at Boston University School of Medicine, director of the Neuropathology Service for VA New England Healthcare System and co-director of the CSTE, led the study, which is the first to characterize the pathology of the disease into four stages of severity. CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated brain trauma, including concussions and multiple subconcussive exposures such as those in contact sports and military combat, the press release explained. “In early stages, CTE is characterized by the presence of abnormal deposits of a protein called tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles and neuropil threads throughout the brain,” according to the release. “These tau lesions eventually lead to brain cell death. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem. The report provides specific pathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE and divides CTE into four stages of disease (Stages I-IV), according to the press release.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Forty-eight subjects were randomly assigned to a control group and a treatment group; those in the treatment group were put on a 25% calorie reduction over a 6-month period. It was found that the treatment group had lower insulin resistance, lower levels of LDL cholesterol, lower body temperature and blood-insulin levels as well as less oxidative damage to their DNA. As of October 2009 the study had 132 participants and was still accepting new \n\nIn this study, Talalay and his team explored and confirmed the anticarcinogenic properties of broccoli and sulforaphane. Inflammation has also been connected to depression, and a 2016 study found broccoli sprouts effective to “prevent or minimize the relapse by inflammation.” This same study found that the extracts of broccoli sprouts were so effective, they acted as a prophylactic that could “prevent the onset of LPS-induced depression-like behaviors” in the juvenile and adolescent mice they were testing, all the way into adulthood. More research is being done on the phytochemicals of cruciferous vegetables and depression. A 2000 study on female fibromyalgia patients reported that the combination of ascorbigen (derived from Vitamin C) and broccoli powder “reduces pain sensitivity and improves quality of life” for patients suffering from this challenging condition. “[T]he results show that a relatively short dietary treatment with broccoli sprouts can strongly protect the heart against oxidative stress and cell death caused by ischemia-reperfusion.” R Which is promising, indeed! One particularly interesting study was carried out on young male smokers, in which 250g/day of broccoli was consumed, for a ten-day period. In 2015 broccoli sprout extract was again found highly effective in reducing of oxidative stress, in this case being observed to assist with healthy liver function. As anti-inflammatories go, sulforaphane is right up there with that king of all spices, curcumin (turmeric) giving our cruciferous vegetables the upper hand in the list of healing foods. “[T]he consumption of broccoli sprouts modulated the excretion of biomarkers linked to inflammation and vascular reactions,” according to a 2015 study.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It released a manual of HIV-specific laws and prosecutions in the 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. territories, federal government, and military in 2010. 3053, The Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act or the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act. The REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act calls for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. The bill died in the Subcommittee on Health, and also in 2013/2014 when \n\n of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights released a report on the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure in Canada with four recommendations for the House of Commons and the Canadian Government. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and \"HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual’s partner is on PrEP or (4) \n\nThe HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (the HOPE Act) is a law that modifies rules regarding organ donation between HIV-positive individuals.

The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act revised the Organ Transplant Amendments Act of 1988, a law that prevented patients from receiving organs from HIV positive people. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act shortened organ transplant wait times, including the wait times for people without HIV as more HIV positive patients receive organs.

The bill replaces this requirement with authorization for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are: (1) infected with such virus before receiving such an organ; and (2) participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations regarding organs infected with HIV developed under this Act or, if participation in such research is no longer warranted, receiving a transplant under such standards and regulations. This allows for four different scenarios in which HIV positive people will not have to disclose their status because of the nature of the sexual encounter; current laws only allow for one specific scenario with multiple requirements. HIV researchers have criticized the recommendations for not going far enough to counteract the adverse effects that the current law imposes on women. Although people living with HIV are generally aware of non-disclosure laws, many do not fully understand the law or understand when they do or do not have to disclose their status. In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or \"negligent\" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the U.S., have enacted laws expressly to criminalize HIV transmission or exposure, charging those accused with criminal transmission of HIV. People have been accused of and charged for HIV non-disclosure even if no harm was intended and if HIV was not actually transmitted.

Studies are being conducted about the use of transdermal nicotine patches to treat anxiety, depression, and inattentiveness in subjects with ADHD and to treat late-life depression. Two small studies have shown that transdermal nicotine patches improve some symptoms of ulcerative colitis. However, this is not the case with Crohn's disease, a similar health condition, where smoking and nicotine intake in general worsen the disease's effects. A meta-analysis found that fewer than 20% of people treated with nicotine replacement therapy remain abstinent from smoking at one year. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as \"Cold Turkey\", or with home remedies. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence.

Types of NRT include the adhesive patch, chewing gum, lozenges, nose spray, and inhaler. Common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning and continued addiction. Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings caused by nicotine addiction. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates. Using nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking should be considered for people who are severely dependent on nicotine. People who are severely dependent include those who smoke: more than one pack per day, within five minutes of awakening, while ill, when they wake up in the middle of the night, to ease withdrawal signs and symptoms.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The North Georgia White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan describe themselves as \"a patriotic, White Christian revival movement dedicated to preserving the maintenance of White Pride and the rights of the White Race\". A 2002 study identified white pride as a motivation for racial hate crimes on a US college campus, while in a different study on internet racism, the slogan was identified as being part of an emerging transnationalist trend in white supremacist movements. The slogan was also documented to have been used in hate speech incidents at New York University, Vassar College, Temple University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Tennessee, and it was a slogan used in posters put \n\n by a white supremacist organization at dozens of US colleges. Similarly, a fitness room in River Falls, Wisconsin was renamed to avoid the racist connotations of it being referred to as the \"White Pride Fitness Room\". The slogan was chanted along with \"White Power\" by up to 100 neo-Nazis rallying in Manchester, United Kingdom in March 2015 and was the theme of a March 2016 event in Swansea and a March 2017 event in Edinburgh, all of which were organized by the National Front. In an exposé from The Week, James Poulos warned that \"Europe is on track to rediscover what looks to us like a highly unsettling form of white pride.\" They didn't have nothing to do, they didn't have nothing for the kids to do, they didn't have nothing for the young girls to do. They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\" In reference to Mexican people, he said: \"They come over here against our Constitution and cross our borders, but they're here, and they're people ... Don't tell me they don't work, and don't tell \n\n pay $485,000 to resolve allegations. In an interview with a conservative website, Saucedo Mercer, a Mexican immigrant who became a U.S. citizen, talked in depth about her views on immigration. She stated the issue was important because people from places other than Mexico were among those coming across the border illegally. And don't tell me they don't have better family structures than most of us white people.\" A year later Bundy called the reaction to his statements a \"misunderstanding,\" saying he was not racist and that he should not have used the term \"Negro.\" He added: \"I've never had a black person or a brown person ever say anything bad about me.\" He then proceeded to make further statements about race, comparing \"welfare and housing\" to slavery. He expressed support for Blacks who have \"raised themselves up to a point where they are equal with the rest of us.\" As an alternative to government jobs and programs, he touted private-sector work. \"We need producers.\" \"On April 2nd, 2019 Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge filed a lawsuit against Bourbon and Boots and owner Rodney Ford under the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Rutledge says her office has received 55 complaints against Bourbon and Boots and the Better Business Bureau has received 293. The psychiatrist explained why she agreed.

Everything that I have ever done\n\n In July 2015, Wolverhampton-born historian and anti-racism campaigner Patrick Vernon OBE called for the design of the flag to be replaced, saying that \"the Black Country factories and foundries made chains, shackles and manacles during slavery that were used in colonial Africa to enslave black people. And of course the chain industry oppressed the white working classes too, so I feel the use of the chain logo is inappropriate in today's world where we know the effects of this history\". Vernon later \n\n In his 1964 speech \"The Ballot or the Bullet\", Malcolm X used the term \"cracker\" in reference to white people in a pejorative context. In one passage, he remarked, \"It's time for you and me to stop sitting in this country, letting some cracker senators, Northern crackers and Southern crackers, sit there in Washington, D.C., and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and I are supposed to have civil rights. There's no white man going to tell me anything about my rights.\" On November 29, 1993, in a speech given at Kean College in New Jersey, Nation \n\n the telephone that a \"creepy ass cracker is following me\" minutes before the altercation between the two men occurred. Zimmerman's attorney then asked her if \"creepy ass cracker\" was an offensive term, to which she responded \"no\". The testimony and response brought about both media and public debate about the use of the word \"cracker\". A CNN report referenced the regional nature of the term, noting both that \"some in Florida use the term in a non-derogatory, colloquial sense\" and that it is sometimes regarded as a \"sharp racial insult that resonates with white southerners even if white northerners don't get it\".\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2017, Scientific Reports published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. LeVay's research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. However, none of the four variants could reliably predict sexual orientation. In August 2019, a genome-wide association study \n\nEvidence supporting the hypothesis that homosexuality has a biological basis comes from various studies. The research suggests that homosexuality is a deep-seated predisposition with a biological origin, similar to heterosexuality. The studies conducted by Kinsey and colleagues, for example, indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be attributed to a single social or psychological cause. One line of evidence supporting the biological basis of homosexuality involves morphological studies of the hypothalamus. Additionally, LeVay discovered that a specific cluster of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is larger in heterosexual men compared to women, as well as heterosexual men compared to homosexual men. Genetic studies also point towards a biological basis for homosexuality. Data from multiple studies show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins and 13 percent of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Inheritance patterns of male homosexuality often implicate a gene on the X chromosome, particularly from the maternal side. It is worth mentioning that psychoanalytic explanations and attempts to prove an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been substantiated by scientific evidence. The current consensus is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, although it may result in secondary reactive disturbances at times. Overall, the evidence from studies on brain morphology and genetics supports the hypothesis that homosexuality has a biological basis. - LeVay, S. \"A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men.\" \"A gene(s) for homosexuality?.\" They hypothesized that \"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\". Their results suggested that \"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\". Research indicated that gay people have lower body weight than straight people. It had been suggested that the overactive TSHR hormone lowered body weight in gay people, though this remains unproven. performed another genome-wide association study on sexual orientation of men and women with data from 26,890 people who had at least one same-sex partner and 450,939 controls. This was popularly dubbed the \"gay gene\" in the media, causing significant controversy. This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X \n\n al. Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Pooled data from multiple studies have shown that approximately 57% of identical twins and 13% of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Most studies suggest that the inheritance pattern of male homosexuality comes from the maternal side, implicating a gene on the X chromosome. However, it is important to note that suggesting a simple genetic connection oversimplifies the complex nature of sexual orientation. It is worth mentioning that attempts to establish an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been successful, and psychoanalytic explanations of homosexuality have not been substantiated. Overall, the current widely held view is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, but rather a result of various factors including genetic and possibly early life differences in the genetic patterning of the nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus. - LeVay S. A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men. Evidence for a biological influence in male homosexuality. The studies of Kinsey and colleagues indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be traced to a single social or psychologic root.The most widely held current view is that homosexuality is not a mental or a personality disorder, though it may at times lead to secondary reactive disturbances.Attempts to demonstrate an endocrine basis for homosexuality have also failed.The authors favor the hypothesis that differences or variations in genetic patterning of the nervous system (possibly of the hypothalamus) set the sexual predilection during early life. If confirmed, these findings, which have been disputed by Byne and others, would support the view that homosexuality has a biologic basis. Pooled data from 5 studies in men show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins (and 13 percent of brothers) of homosexual men are also homosexual. In most studies, the inheritance pattern of male homosexuality comes from the maternal side, implicating a gene on the X chromosome (LeVay and Hamer) but to suggest there is a simple genetic connection is oversimplified. Attempts to demonstrate an endocrine basis for homosexuality have also failed. The most widely held current view is that homosexuality is not a mental or a personality disorder, though it may at times lead to secondary reactive disturbances.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

There is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical \n\n Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. According to the CDC, due to data collection \n\n the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion. There are more second trimester abortions in developing countries such as China, India and Vietnam than in developed countries. risk of death from abortion approaches roughly half the risk of death from childbirth the farther along a woman is in pregnancy; from one in a million before 9 weeks gestation to nearly one in ten thousand at 21 weeks or more (as measured from the last menstrual period). The studies supporting this did not control for factors not related to abortion or miscarriage, and hence the causes of this correlation have not been \n\n 43.8 million having been performed in 2008. The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly \n\n per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women. The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\". Abortion rate – number of abortions annually per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age (some sources use a range of 15–49) ; Abortion percentage – number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages) There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion: In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable. The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6 million having been performed in 2003\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Levels of interleukin1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein1 were all associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease. A cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in COVID-19, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19. Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. Here, we investigated the effects of EMFs with long-term evolution (LTE, 1.762 GHz) and 5G (28 GHz) bandwidth on skin pigmentation in vitro. Murine and Human melanoma cells (B16F10 and MNT-1) were exposed to either LTE or 5G for 4 h per day, which is considered the upper bound of average smartphone use time. It was shown that neither LTE nor 5G exposure induced significant effects on cell viability or pigmentation. Collectively, these results imply that exposure to LTE and 5G EMFs may not affect melanin synthesis or skin pigmentation under normal smartphone use condition. In the afternoon of 30 December, upon seeing the words \"SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa\", Ai immediately reported to the hospital's public health department and infection department. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in \n\nEvidence for a connection between coronavirus disease-19 and exposure to radiofrequency radiation from wireless communications including 5G. Label=\"BACKGROUND AND AIM\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak. Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019. The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 December, and at least 266 by 31 December. On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC \n\nThere are two main types of electromagnetic radiation: non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation includes radio frequency, microwaves, and light. On the other hand, ionizing radiation includes ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These higher frequency EMFs can lead to DNA and cellular damage with prolonged exposure. While non-ionizing radiation is generally considered safe, the use of certain devices that emit non-ionizing radiation, such as cell phones and microwaves, has raised concerns about potential health effects. However, extensive research has not demonstrated any consistent evidence linking these devices to harmful effects on human cells. Overall, while it is important to be mindful of prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation, the effects of non-ionizing radiation on human cells are generally minimal and non-harmful. It is always recommended to follow guidelines and safety measures to minimize any potential risks associated with electromagnetic radiation. Cytokine storms can be caused by a number of infectious and non-infectious etiologies, especially viral respiratory infections such as H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2, Influenza B, Parainfluenza virus, and Ebola. Cytokine storm syndromes include familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Epstein-Barr virus–associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic or non-systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis–associated macrophage activation syndrome, NLRC4 macrophage activation syndrome, cytokine release syndrome and sepsis. History The first reference to the term cytokine storm in the published medical literature appears to be by James Ferrara in 1993 during a discussion of graft vs. host disease; a condition in which the role of excessive and self-perpetuating cytokine release had already been under discussion for many years.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed ; transcranial direct current stimulation ; resection In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. Although such treatment can be costly, multiple studies have demonstrated that ATL in patients who have failed at least two anticonvulsant drug trials (thereby meeting the criteria for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) has lower mortality, lower morbidity and lower long-term cost in comparison with continued medical therapy without surgical intervention. The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. Therefore, ATL is considered the standard of care for patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. (1993) found increased electrophysiological abnormalities in sexually abused children. (1993) used the \"Limbic System Checklist-33\" to measure ictal temporal lobe epilepsy-like symptoms in 253 adults. In all the patients, visual inspection identified unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and the patients underwent craniotomy and lesionectomy. According to the results, eight patients were categorized in class I and two cases were classifies as class II, and all the patients survived. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy in children, which is difficult to control by medication (1). Neuroplasticity decreases by age; therefore, faster recovery is expected during infancy and early childhood. Nonetheless, intractable seizure is a risk factor for refractory epilepsy. The exact boundaries for removal can vary slightly in practice and between neurosurgeons. It is a treatment option for temporal lobe epilepsy for those in whom anticonvulsant medications do not control epileptic seizures, and who have frequent seizures, and who additionally qualify based on a WADA test to localize the dominant hemisphere for language faculties. What are the different types of clinical seizures? Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery? What are the types of epilepsy surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means. The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria. There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus callosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator. In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications. Epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients. Even with the presence of widespread unilateral epileptogenicity or anatomic/functional imaging abnormalities, complete hemispherectomy can often be avoided, particularly when there is little hemiparesis. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928 for glioblastoma multiforme. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri-insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery.

This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. 2004, 10 of the 13 co-authors of the Wakefield study withdrew the original interpretation. The United States Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 2004 report found that, \"the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), National Health Service (NHS), World Health Organization (WHO), European Medicines Agency (EMEA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and many other national and international medical organizations have issued statements of a similar nature, finding no link between autism and thimerosal based on the evidence currently available from a variety of studies. Rimland contended that the vaccination triggered autism by placing a burden on the immune systems of children between birth and age 2. When the California Department of Health Services, along with studies from England and Finland, reported that the vaccine \"plays little or no role in the disease,\" Rimland stated that it was \"much too early to dismiss the [vaccine] hypothesis\". He remained undeterred when a study by Robert L. Davis, published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, found no association between MMR and inflammatory bowel disease, discussed in the Wakefield report, \"nor any evidence that the vaccine triggered acute onset of symptoms.\" Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. After two doses, 97% of people are protected against measles, 88% against mumps, and at least 97% against rubella. Worldwide over 500 million doses were administered between 1999 and 2004, and 575 million doses have been administered since the vaccine's introduction worldwide. Rates of disease have been seen to increase in populations that go unvaccinated. Side effects of immunization are generally mild and go away without any specific treatment. Because it contains live viruses, the MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be given while breastfeeding. Being recently immunized does not increase the risk of passing measles, mumps, or rubella on to others. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and autistic spectrum disorders. The MMR vaccine is a mixture of live weakened viruses of the three diseases. The MMRV vaccine, which also covers chickenpox, may be used instead. Medical use Cochrane concluded that the \"Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR and MMRV vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles mumps rubella and varicella.\" After two doses, 97% of people are protected against measles, 88% against mumps, and at least 97% against rubella.

This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. A vaccine that is generally \n\nThere have been claims suggesting a potential relationship between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism in children with bowel symptoms. These claims were initially proposed by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues, who hypothesized that the measles virus from the vaccine could lodge in the gut of susceptible children, damaging the bowel and causing autism. However, it is important to note that the claim made by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues has been extensively discredited. Numerous studies and scientific research have been conducted to investigate this claim, and no credible evidence has been found to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, it is crucial to understand that this study did not establish a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. It merely aimed to characterize these bowel findings in children with autism. Overall, the vast majority of scientific evidence and reputable medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), strongly support the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine has been administered to millions of children worldwide and has proven to be an essential tool in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. It is widely accepted in the medical community that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable. Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700 cases of diarrhoea by 26 March. The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks \n\n created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunisation, a proper dealing with measles cases, national campaigns, introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles. The outbreak began in the capital, Luanda, and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces.

In the badly hit Port City of Beira, anti-cholera vaccines have been provided for close to a million people. Mozambique’s National Director of Medical Care says vaccination campaign has succeeded in covering 84% of the target. The deputy representative for UNICEF in Mozambique, Michel Le Pechoux said there are still more than thirty-five hundred confirmed cases. Delft Institute for Water Education, and their peers from Uganda and Tanzania, have found traces of 25 DNA virus families in underground water in the slums of Kampala and Arusha. The findings, which were presented at the assembly of the European Geo-Sciences Union in Vienna on Monday, showed most groundwater in the two slums contains traces of Harpis virus, Pox virus and Papilloma virus. It aims to increase the ability for the government to monitor health risks and the immunization process, as well as better the relationship between the Haitian government and international organizations within the health sector. Currently the results of this project are: 45.3% of children aged 12 to 23 months in project intervention areas are fully vaccinated, 45% of suspected cases of cholera are given notifications within 10 days, 72% and 77% of suspected cases of diphtheria and measles, respectively, were investigated and reported within 48 hours. humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe. A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10 April. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be at least $2.2 billion (2019 USD), with US$1 billion alone in infrastructure damages, making Idai the costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean basin. In 2014, Angola launched a national campaign of vaccination against measles, extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all 18 provinces in the country.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This allows even conflicting nations to come together through science to find solutions to global issues. Global organizations, researchers, public health officials, countries, government officials, and clinicians have previously worked together to create effective measures of infection control and subsequent treatment. They continue to do so through sharing of resources, research data, ideas, and by putting into effect laws and regulations that can further advance scientific research. Without the collaborative efforts of such entities, the world would not have the vaccines and treatments we now possess for diseases that were once considered deadly such as tuberculosis, tetanus, polio, influenza, etc. Historically, science diplomacy has proved successful in diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika and continues to be relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic today. Quarantine measures were highly impacted by commercial interests, however. As such, quarantines were effective, but their unsystematic nature made them unduly oppressive.
