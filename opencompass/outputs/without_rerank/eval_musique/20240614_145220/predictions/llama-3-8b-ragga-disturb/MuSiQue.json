The lake's name derives from the Mapuche words rëngi, \"cane\", and hue, \"place\". These rivers drain most of northern Los Ríos Region as well as parts of Araucanía Region and Neuquén Province in Argentina. A second large river, Bueno River is responsible for the draining of the southern parts of the region including Ranco Lake, Chile's 4th largest lake. Valdivia River is provided by the Seven Lakes chain plus Lácar Lake and Bueno River from Ranco, Maihue and Puyehue Lake. La Unión was founded in 1821 during the government of Bernardo O'Higgins, to secure sovereignty over the Central Valley south of Valdivia. It is a major centre for milk production; COLUN is the main milk and dairy product producer in the zone. The commune is covered in forest to the west of the city and the east is dominated by agricultural landscapes spanning Los Llanos. The city served until 2001 as a dormitory town for the coal mines of Catamutún. Lovely lake-resort towns and villages dot the lakesides, chiefly Pucón, Villarrica, Frutillar and Puerto Varas. Puerto Montt is the tourist hub of the region; two of them, were considered among the best destinations in South America in 2012 by the specialized tourism site TripAdvisor.

Through her different genres of work including children's stories, poems, and short stories, Mary Wilkins Freeman sought to demonstrate her values as a feminist. During the time which she was writing, she did this in nonconventional ways; for example, she diverged from making her female characters weak and in need of help which was a common trope in literature. Through characters such as Louisa in her short story: “A New England Nun,” Freeman challenges contemporary ideas concerning female roles, values, and relationships in society. Also, Freeman's short story “The Revolt of 'Mother'\" illustrated the struggles of rural women \n\n the role they played within their families. Although she produced a dozen volumes of short stories and as many novels, Freeman is remembered chiefly for the first two collections of stories, A Humble Romance and Other Stories (1887) and A New England Nun and Other Stories (1891), and the novel Pembroke (1894) (Britannica Encyclopedia). Freeman began writing stories and verse for children while still a teenager to help support her family and was quickly successful. Her best known work was written in the 1880s and 1890s while she lived in Randolph. She is best known for two collections of stories, A Humble Romance and Other Stories (1887) and A New England Nun and Other Stories (1891). She was the author of several books which proved \n\n first adult fiction. The subscription lists to her work contain many aristocrats which suggests the family had been well connected but had fallen on hard times. Her first major work was a novel entitled The Happy Unfortunate; Or The female page. She became popular for her writing, especially her ghost stories, aided by Charles Dickens, who published her work in his magazine Household Words. Her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She usually emphasized the role of women, with complex narratives and realistic female characters. Gaskell said she was influenced by the writings of Jane Austen. Her treatment of class continues to interest social historians as well as fiction lovers. Her work is of interest to social historians as well as readers of literature. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Brontë's life; the rest she left out, deciding that certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. She gained recognition early in life from prominent literary figures including Thomas Wentworth Higginson and John Greenleaf Whittier. At age 19 she sent a Civil War story titled \"A Sacrifice Consumed\" to Harper's Magazine. Another of her poems, \"To the Cleveland Union Savers,\" published in The Anti-Slavery Bugle of Feb. 23, 1861, champions Sara Lucy Bagby, the last person in the United States to be returned to slavery under the Fugitive Slave Law.

In 1982, while she was at All Saints Convent, she founded Helen House, a hospice for children, inspired by two-year-old Helen Worswick. Sister Frances met Helen following surgery to remove a brain tumour, leaving Helen severely disabled. The friendship which developed between Frances and Helen and her parents proved the inspiration for the world's first children's hospice. More information on the work of Helen House today can be found at the Helen House website. A full account of the history of Helen House can be found in A House Called Helen, written by Helen's mother, Jacqueline Worswick. The concept has now been replicated on all continents. Recognising that young people with progressive life-shortening conditions were living much longer than they might once have done, Sister Frances went on to found Douglas House, a \"respice\" for people between the ages of 16 and 35 with life-shortening conditions. Named after a young man who had stayed many times in Helen House until he died aged 26, the house was opened by the Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2004. It is built in the same grounds as Helen House. Sister Frances's involvement with Helen and Douglas House came to and end in 2013 due to unproven allegations of abuse for which she was never charged and which were not associated with the hospices. Sister Frances is author of a book entitled Just My Reflection ... helping families to do things their way when their child dies first published in 1997.

In 2009 in the United Arab Emirates, the government regulatory and operational authorities for healthcare in Abu Dhabi mandated a wide-scale reform of the emirate’s postgraduate residency programs to the competency-based framework of the newly formed Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-International (ACGME-I). This article briefly describes the rationale for competency-based medical education and provides an overview of the transition from traditional, time-based residency training to competency-based postgraduate medical education for the Pediatrics residency programs in Abu Dhabi. With the 21st century globalization of medicine, these Western-developed frameworks have significantly influenced postgraduate medical training in the East. More recently, several countries, including Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, have restructured their residency training programs around the core competencies of the US-based Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education- International (ACGME-I). By aligning the requisite competencies desired in health professional trainees with each country’s health care priorities, competency-based training directly integrates graduate medical education (GME) with the health and healthcare needs of populations [2,3]. Outcomes-based learning was first introduced as an instructional strategy by behavioral psychologists as early as the 1950′s , but it was not uniformly adopted until decades later when several influential reports called for a transition to competency-based training and regulatory bodies such as the ACGME and the RCPSC mandated CBME as a requirement for accreditation [5,6]. in Burma, affirmative action of sorts was introduced by the government of U Nu in the 1950s, primarily due to the disproportionate control the Anglo-Burmans had in government departments and the running of the country. Many Anglo-Burmese began to lose their jobs, to be replaced with pure Burmans as the bureaucracy of the country became increasingly Burmanized. Additional measures relating to the Burmese language were introduced so that to take the matriculation exam to enter Rangoon University, prospective students were required to be fluent in written Burmese (which many Anglo-Burmans had not been taught), even though all books and most teaching were still carried out in English. The equal right to education for men and women is guaranteed by Myanmar’s Constitution. In 2008, Myanmar's new Constitution prioritized education after years of under prioritization of education in the previous military rule. Between 2008 and 2013, because of the government's encouragement of education policies, Myanmar saw a rise in the number of girls attaining education. Currently, there are more women than men in Myanmar's education system. The literacy rate for adult women is 86% compared to just over 90% for men. Despite the progress, there are continued traditional cultural barriers that prevent women from capitalizing on their education attainment. There are extreme disparities between urban and rural educational performance. The Shan State region of Myanmar has the lowest female literacy rates at 59.4%.Additionally while a growing proportion of women are pursuing higher education this number does not match the future employment fate of women, where men make the larger proportion of those in the workforce. Moreover, women still do not occupy senior levels of economic decision making, despite their high education.

Parliament went into dissolution on 24 March 2016, allowing the official period of campaigning to get underway. Five parties had MSPs in the previous parliament: Scottish National Party (SNP) led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish \n\n Many areas of Scots law are legislated for by the Scottish Parliament, in matters devolved from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. However, certain powers are reserved to Westminster including defence, international relations, fiscal and economic policy, drugs law, and broadcasting. The Scottish Parliament also has been granted limited tax raising powers. Although technically the Parliament of the United Kingdom retains full power to legislate for Scotland, under the Sewel convention it will not legislate on devolved matters without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament. In 1997 a referendum was held, and the people of Scotland voted for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. The United Kingdom Parliament retains responsibility for Scotland's defence, international relations and certain other areas. A Scottish independence referendum was held in September 2014, at which time independence was rejected. The Boundary Commission also recommended changes to the electoral regions used to elect \"list\" members of the Scottish Parliament, which were also implemented in 2011. Energy policy in Scotland is a matter that has been specifically reserved to the UK parliament under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998 that created the devolved Scottish Parliament. In 2004, the Enterprise Committee of the Scottish Parliament called for the development of a 'fully fledged' Scottish energy policy. The SNP Government that took power in May 2007 specifically included the word 'energy' in a portfolio title when the junior ministerial position of Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism was created to replace the position of 'Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning'. Blair also came into power with a policy of devolution. A pre-legislative referendum was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions: whether to create a devolved Parliament for Scotland and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. In the 2007 Scottish general election, the Scottish National Party gained enough seats to form a minority government with its leader Alex Salmond as First Minister. Devolution also returned to Northern Ireland, leaving England as the only constituent country of the United Kingdom without a devolved administration. received unique treatment was Northern Ireland. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court's judgement, designated itself under Schedule4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament.

Parliament went into dissolution on 24 March 2016, allowing the official period of campaigning to get underway. Five parties had MSPs in the previous parliament: Scottish National Party (SNP) led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish \n\n Many areas of Scots law are legislated for by the Scottish Parliament, in matters devolved from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. However, certain powers are reserved to Westminster including defence, international relations, fiscal and economic policy, drugs law, and broadcasting. The Scottish Parliament also has been granted limited tax raising powers. Although technically the Parliament of the United Kingdom retains full power to legislate for Scotland, under the Sewel convention it will not legislate on devolved matters without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament. In 1997 a referendum was held, and the people of Scotland voted for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. The United Kingdom Parliament retains responsibility for Scotland's defence, international relations and certain other areas. A Scottish independence referendum was held in September 2014, at which time independence was rejected. The Boundary Commission also recommended changes to the electoral regions used to elect \"list\" members of the Scottish Parliament, which were also implemented in 2011. Energy policy in Scotland is a matter that has been specifically reserved to the UK parliament under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998 that created the devolved Scottish Parliament. In 2004, the Enterprise Committee of the Scottish Parliament called for the development of a 'fully fledged' Scottish energy policy. The SNP Government that took power in May 2007 specifically included the word 'energy' in a portfolio title when the junior ministerial position of Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism was created to replace the position of 'Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning'. Blair also came into power with a policy of devolution. A pre-legislative referendum was held in Scotland in 1997 with two questions: whether to create a devolved Parliament for Scotland and whether it should have limited tax-varying powers. This produced a narrow 'yes' vote. Both measures were put into effect and the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly began operating in 1999. In the 2007 Scottish general election, the Scottish National Party gained enough seats to form a minority government with its leader Alex Salmond as First Minister. Devolution also returned to Northern Ireland, leaving England as the only constituent country of the United Kingdom without a devolved administration. received unique treatment was Northern Ireland. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court's judgement, designated itself under Schedule4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent.\n\n"

In 1976, West Ham loaned him to the Hartford Bicentennials of the North American Soccer League. He amassed 372 appearances and 41 goals for West Ham in all competitions, until his departure in 1987. By 1990, West Ham were required to convert Upton Park into an all-seater stadium for the 1994-95 season in order to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report. Holding on to Hartson and Ferdinand gave Harry Redknapp's men an even more enhanced chance of achieving that goal next time round. He played three games before returning to West Ham. This was part of a deal which saw Christian Dailly move to West Ham for £1.7 million. As winners of the 1999 Intertoto Cup, West Ham gained entry to the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, the first time the club had qualified for the UEFA Cup in their history.

After passing around and through the turbine blades, water is discharged into the tailrace located on the east side of the powerhouse where it flows into the Columbia River. More recently (2010) the penstocks from Coon Pond to the Mill Lake Station were replaced with black polypropylene, buried underground. From its source at the outlet of Holmes Lake in the Monashee Mountains of British Columbia, the Kettle River flows south to Midway, British Columbia. Along the way it is joined by many tributaries, most notably the West Kettle River. Below Midway, the river loops south, crossing the Canada–US border into the United States, through Ferry County, Washington, before flowing north back into Canada, passing by Grand Forks, British Columbia, where the Granby River joins. After flowing east for about 10 mi, the river turns south again, just south of Christina Lake, entering the United States again. It then flows south, forming part of the Ferry-Stevens County line, before joining the Columbia River near Kettle Falls, Washington. The Columbia River at this point is a large reservoir impounded behind Grand Coulee Dam, called Lake Roosevelt. The Kettle enters the lake at the Columbia's river mile 706. The Kettle River is undammed, making it one of the extremely few rivers with constant flow in the Pacific Northwest. The Kettle River Range encompasses an area of 2700 mi2 and is a subrange of the Monashee Mountains, which in turn form part of the Columbia Mountains. The range runs north to south, bordered on the east by the Kettle River and the Columbia River, and on the west by the Kettle River, the Curlew Valley and the San Poil River. The mountainous region begins immediately north of the Canada–US border, at Grand Forks, British Columbia, extending 110 miles (177 km) south to the bend of the Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt, formed by Grand Coulee Dam, where it terminates. The Okanogan Highlands are adjacent to the range on the west, and the Selkirk Mountains are adjacent on the east. Supporters of wind energy advocate for wind turbine construction on BC's north coast and Peace River regions, which have been shown to receive constant winds throughout the year. The Kettle River once supported salmon and other anadromous fish. The construction of Grand Coulee Dam, along with Chief Joseph Dam, blocked fish migration up the Columbia and its upper tributaries, including the Kettle River.

Until 2012, it had one coal fueled generating unit with low nitrogen oxide (NOx) burners, providing a peak output of 230 MW fuelled by low-sulfur lignite coal from the Ravenscrag Formation in Southern Saskatchewan. In late 2012, the facility powered down and underwent renovations, due to the Ontario government's initiative to \n\n  The powerhouse is located at Chelan Falls. After passing around and through the turbine blades, water is discharged into the tailrace located on the east side of the powerhouse where it flows into the Columbia River. More recently (2010) the penstocks from Coon Pond to the Mill Lake Station were replaced with black polypropylene, buried underground. From its source at the outlet of Holmes Lake in the Monashee Mountains of British Columbia, the Kettle River flows south to Midway, British Columbia. Along the way it is joined by many tributaries, most notably the West Kettle River. Below Midway, the river loops south, crossing the Canada–US border into the United States, through Ferry County, Washington, before flowing north back into Canada, passing by Grand Forks, British Columbia, where the Granby River joins. After flowing east for about 10 mi, the river turns south again, just south of Christina Lake, entering the United States again. It then flows south, forming part of the Ferry-Stevens County line, before joining the Columbia River near Kettle Falls, Washington. The Columbia River at this point is a large reservoir impounded behind Grand Coulee Dam, called Lake Roosevelt. The Kettle enters the lake at the Columbia's river mile 706. The Kettle River is undammed, making it one of the extremely few rivers with constant flow in the Pacific Northwest. The Kettle River Range encompasses an area of 2700 mi2 and is a subrange of the Monashee Mountains, which in turn form part of the Columbia Mountains. The range runs north to south, bordered on the east by the Kettle River and the Columbia River, and on the west by the Kettle River, the Curlew Valley and the San Poil River. The mountainous region begins immediately north of the Canada–US border, at Grand Forks, British Columbia, extending 110 miles (177 km) south to the bend of the Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt, formed by Grand Coulee Dam, where it terminates. The Okanogan Highlands are adjacent to the range on the west, and the Selkirk Mountains are adjacent on the east. Supporters of wind energy advocate for wind turbine construction on BC's north coast and Peace River regions, which have been shown to receive constant winds throughout the year. The Kettle River once supported salmon and other anadromous fish. The construction of Grand Coulee Dam, along with Chief Joseph Dam, blocked fish migration up the Columbia and its upper tributaries, including the Kettle River. In addition, Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, Lake Roosevelt, flooded traditional fishery sites, including Kettle Falls near the mouth of the Kettle River.\n\n"

It is operated by Basin Electric Power Cooperative and owned jointly by several of its member cooperatives. It is the first generating station to be converted by OPG to be fueled by biomass, and is North America's largest purely biomass-fueled power plant. The conversion came at a cost of C$200 million, and the plant was re-opened on 10 September 2014. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. At 5,428 MW, it is the tenth largest in the world, and the second-largest in Canada, after the Robert-Bourassa generating station in northwestern Quebec. Rather than a single large dam, the plant's reservoir is contained by 88 dykes, totalling 64 km in length. Now called the Smallwood Reservoir, it has a capacity of 33 cubic kilometres in a catchment area of about 72,000 square kilometres, an area larger than the Republic of Ireland. It drops over 305 metres to the site of the plant's 11 turbines. Starting in the 1950s, coal made up a large part of Ontario’s power mix. Coal was inexpensive, and Ontario lacked sufficient alternatives such as hydroelectric power or natural gas. By the late 1990s, however, links between adverse health effects and air pollution were firmly established, and much of this could be traced to Ontario’s coal-powered plants. In 2003, Ontario began to replace its coal-fired plants with nuclear energy, completing the switchover in 2014. Ontario’s first electrical power supply came from a hydroelectric generating station on the Ottawa River in 1892. Hydro expanded rapidly across the province in the early 20th century. So, in the 1950s, Ontario added six coal-fired power stations to meet rising demand.

D. McClatchy. Based on the Stephen King 1992 novel Dolores Claiborne, the opera was commissioned by the San Francisco Opera and premiered in San Francisco on September 18, 2013. Dolores Claiborne is being interrogated about the recent death of Vera Donovan, a wealthy widow who employed Dolores as a maid for forty years. A series of flashbacks reveal that when she began working for Vera Donovan, Dolores was the victim of an abusive husband who, as she eventually learns, was also molesting their daughter. Vera and Dolores gradually develop a relationship during her first ten years of service. Dolores Claiborne is a 1995 American psychological thriller drama film directed by Taylor Hackford and starring Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Christopher Plummer, and David Strathairn. The screenplay for Dolores Claiborne was adapted by Tony Gilroy, and the film was shot in Nova Scotia in 1994. Dolores Claiborne was well-received by critics, with the performances of Bates and Leigh being especially praised, and grossed over $46 million on a $13 million budget. Kathy Bates stated in a retrospective interview that her performance as the titular Dolores was her favorite performance she had ever given. The novel was adapted into a 1995 film directed by Taylor Hackford. It starred Kathy Bates as Dolores, with Jennifer Jason Leigh as her daughter Selena, and Judy Parfitt as Vera Donovan. Dolores Claiborne, the operatic adaptation of the novel composed by Tobias Picker to a libretto by J. D.

She is joined by Selena, her now adult daughter, who tells the police Dolores could not have murdered Vera as the two had become very close after 40 years together.

Early in the first act, Vera’s admonition to her maids about properly hanging the sheets to dry, set to angular jitters, opens up into sumptuous ardor, then closes again into anxiety, with an ease of transition that recalls Janacek. However, after the casting of Kiernan Shipka and Emma Roberts was announced in April 2014, and the casting of Lucy Boynton, Lauren Holly, and James Remar was announced in February 2015, the film then became a reality. Principal photography for the film began in February 2015 in Kemptville, Ontario, Canada, and the film's soundtrack was scored by Perkins' brother, Elvis Perkins, a singer-songwriter.

Aleksandr Bushkov was born in the ancient city of Minusinsk, which is located Krasnoyarsk Krai, Siberia, Russia, on April 5, 1956. His ancestors had Baltic origins and originated in Lithuania. He struggled to learn in a conventional classroom setting, and he has stated in interviews that he was a poor student, often acting up. Bushkov would never receive an undergraduate degree and was largely self-taught, through his voracious appetite for reading.

Prior to the death in a helicopter crash of the former governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai, Alexander Lebed in 2002, Bushkov had held office as an advisor and aide to the governor. After 2002, information about Bushkov has become increasingly scarce.

Kids, Mick and Mack, reading a storybook about Ronald McDonald showing off his magical bag at a picnic in the meadow. Suddenly, the Hamburglar appears and steals Ronald's Magic Bag. Mick and Mack then search outside Ronald's clubhouse for four of the puzzle cards. After collecting four of the puzzle cards, Mick and Mack are told by Ronald that the Hamburglar was sighted near Birdie's treehouse. Upon arriving at Birdie's treehouse, Mick and Mack search her house for five of her puzzle cards. After finding her puzzle cards, Mick and Mack are told that the Hamburglar is sighted near the cliffs. Following the directions \n\n Mickey Mouse wanders into a jungle and comes across several animals, including elephants, monkeys, and lions. A monkey and parrot begin playing a tune on Mickey's accordion, and it turns into a concert for the jungle animals. Mickey dances with a lion, a bear and a pair of monkeys to the tune of Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube. Then two ostriches dance as Mickey plays \"Auld Lang Syne\" on a makeshift saxophone. Mickey continues with \"Aloha 'Oe\", \"Turkey in the Straw\" and \"Yankee Doodle\", and the animals applaud. In Moving Potions, Mickey is shrunk to a tiny size and placed on a chess-like game board. Once all potions have been collected, the player returns to normal size and receives their item from Donald Duck (dressed as a wizard). Mickey must dust off portraits hanging on the castle walls in matching pairs. Up to two players can play the game at once, and both characters can walk, jump, duck and pick up blocks to throw at enemies as they travel through the seven large worlds of magical McDonaldland. In a similar format as Super Mario Bros. 3 or StarTropics, the game has seven different worlds. Each one starts out with a visit to a McDonaldland character. McDonald's franchise imagery found in this game includes the various characters from restaurants and television commercials, and McDonald's cards and Golden Arches — all of which are variously available for plot advancement and as power-ups. Kids include a spin device that turns the player upside down and reverses gravity, the ability to warp throughout the current level via a zipper, and a boat that can be both ridden and carried. The game reinforces the reading skills of older children to allow for confidence and language skills. Although deemed too difficult for young users by an Adult Juror, being able to record voice narration is good reading practice. One example of such a game is \"The Adventures of Amaru,\" which aims to promote word coding-decoding skills and vocabulary growth through teaching trials.

He is armed with a feather duster and a sliding ladder. Players must match up all the pictures before time and light runs out to receive an item from Daisy Duck as a princess. Playing the Pipes is another memory game. Mickey must listen, remember, and repeat what he heard. He can do this by jumping on the top of the pipes \n\n Progressing through the storyline the player unlocks more characters and attractions. Premium characters and attractions are unlocked using Gems, which are earned by leveling up characters, completing character collections, or viewing daily announcements. The game also features chests, occasionally hidden in the Kingdom, but also can be bought for Gems, which award different prizes depending on the type of chest, such as attractions, Tokens, decorations, or concessions. Also in the game is Merlin's Shop, in which the player can obtain Tokens and attractions through Elixirs, which are obtained by exchanging them for decorations and concessions in Merlin's cauldron. The game also includes floats based on each franchise, which grant Magic, Tokens or Gems through parades. Playing during Events can unlock limited-time characters and attractions. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a leading philanthropic group dedicated to health and health care, has recognized the potential of video games in this field and has included video game development in their projects.

Over the succeeding decades, Tucker became one of the few child performers to mature into adulthood without losing her audience, and during the course of her career, she notched a streak of top-10 and top-40 hits. She has had several successful albums, several Country Music Association award nominations, and hit songs such as 1973's \"What's Your Mama's Name?\" and \"Blood Red and Goin' Down\", 1975's \"Lizzie and the Rainman\", 1988's \"Strong Enough to Bend\", and 1992's \"Two Sparrows in a Hurricane\".

Gentry also brought \"Mississippi Delta\" to Capitol on the same demo tape and it was this recording, rather than \"Ode to Billie Joe\", that initially got her signed. In retrospect, the track is more obviously commercial and reflects what was on the charts in 1967. Gentry most likely recorded the song at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California. She recorded a 12-song demo that would become the basis of her debut album. Gentry was officially signed to Capitol Records on June 23, 1967.

It was written by Vassal Benford and Ronald Spearman for her eponymous debut studio album (1993), while production was helmed by the former. While there was no accompanying music video for \"I Belong to You\", the song garnered Braxton a nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards. In the mid-1970s, recorded for the Playboy Records label. Borchers released two albums for Playboy: Bobby Borchers in 1977 and Denim and Rhinestones a year later. He also charted nine times within the Top 40 of the Hot Country Songs charts, including the number seven \"Cheap Perfume and Candlelight\" in 1977. Borchers later moved to Epic Records, where he released three singles: \"Sweet Fantasy,\" \"Wishing I Had Listened to Your Song\" and \"I Just Wanna Feel the Magic.\" Tanya Denise Tucker (born October 10, 1958) is an American country music singer and songwriter who had her first hit, \"Delta Dawn\", in 1972 at the age of 13. Over the succeeding decades, Tucker became one of the few child performers to mature into adulthood without losing her audience, and during the course of her career, she notched a streak of top-10 and top-40 hits. She has had several successful albums, several Country Music Association award nominations, and hit songs such as 1973's \"What's Your Mama's Name?\" and \"Blood Red and Goin' Down\", 1975's \"Lizzie and the Rainman\", 1988's \"Strong Enough to Bend\", and 1992's \"Two Sparrows in a Hurricane\". While Tucker was initially apprehensive about it, the track actually came about pretty easily. Tucker explained, \"So I went into the restroom to think—I do my best thinking there—went back out, and [Brandi] was in the panel room. And then we walked in there to the vocal booth, and the band came in, and we recorded it.\" She said that Carlile didn't want her to, saying that this album was about Tanya the singer, not Tanya the performer. Carlile told her, \"This song sticks. Gentry's sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling the Washington Post that she only sang on the recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\" that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it. Gentry also brought \"Mississippi Delta\" to Capitol on the same demo tape and it was this recording, rather than \"Ode to Billie Joe\", that initially got her signed. In retrospect, the track is more obviously commercial and reflects what was on the charts in 1967. Gentry most likely recorded the song at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California. She recorded a 12-song demo that would become the basis of her debut album. Gentry was officially signed to Capitol Records on June 23, 1967.

From these measurements, Kepler was able to formulate Kepler's laws, the first modern description of planetary motion: Kepler published the first two laws in 1609 and the third law in 1619. They \n\n During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system. His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler. It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. These reactions use the star's hydrogen very slowly, allowing it to burn for billions of years. In 1609, Johannes Kepler, using his teacher's (Tycho Brahe) accurate measurements, noticed the inconsistency of a heliocentric model where the sun is exactly in the centre. The three laws of planetary motion are: where a is the radius of the orbit, T is the period, G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Sun. Until the work of Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), a German astronomer, the prevailing belief was that the sun and planets orbited the earth. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus had proposed that all the planets orbited in circles around the sun, but his theory did not give very satisfactory predictions and was largely ignored. When Kepler studied his boss Tycho Brahe's observations of Mars's position in the sky on many nights, Kepler realized that Mars's orbit could not be a circle. After years of analysis, Kepler discovered that Mars's orbit was likely to be an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the ellipse's focal points. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun [approximately] at one focus, in his first law of planetary motion. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old.

It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets. Improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries. These reactions use the star's hydrogen very slowly, allowing it to burn for billions of years. In 1609, Johannes Kepler, using his teacher's (Tycho Brahe) accurate measurements, noticed the inconsistency of a heliocentric model where the sun is exactly in the centre. The three laws of planetary motion are: where a is the radius of the orbit, T is the period, G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the Sun. Until the work of Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), a German astronomer, the prevailing belief was that the sun and planets orbited the earth. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus had proposed that all the planets orbited in circles around the sun, but his theory did not give very satisfactory predictions and was largely ignored. When Kepler studied his boss Tycho Brahe's observations of Mars's position in the sky on many nights, Kepler realized that Mars's orbit could not be a circle. After years of analysis, Kepler discovered that Mars's orbit was likely to be an ellipse, with the Sun at one of the ellipse's focal points. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler discovered that the orbits along which the planets travel around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun [approximately] at one focus, in his first law of planetary motion. The other focus of either ellipse has no known physical significance. At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe. Theoretical \n\n due to the brightness of the Sun ).

The Party of Bible-abiding Christians (Partei Bibeltreuer Christen, PBC) was a conservative evangelical minor right-wing political party in Germany. It was founded in 1989 during a convent of the Federation of Pentecostal Churches (Germany) to serve as political arm of the christian right in germany.

The party's success, however, was very limited on the federal and state levels of government because it never reached the \"5% hurdle\" of votes cast necessary to get into the parliaments in Germany's system of proportional representation.

The party was a member of the European Christian Political Movement (EPCM). The coalition was formed in August 2020, and was initially composed of two alliances Democratic Front, Popular Movement and Socialist People's Party, which is not part of any alliances. The main goal of the coalition is to overthrow the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of President Milo Đukanović, which has been in power since its founding in 1991. All coalition member parties employed a more significant cultural and socially conservative discourse, due to 2020 Montenegrin political crisis and the open conflict between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the DPS-led Montenegrin government, following the adoption of the disputed law on the status of religious communities in Montenegro, supporting 2019-2020 clerical protests in Montenegro and Serbian Orthodox Church rights in Montenegro. More recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline-grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities. This opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short-lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.

Fire from the soldiers at Meicheng (then romanized \"Min-tsing\" from its role as the seat of Minqing County) turned back an expedition by Karl Gützlaff and Edwin Stevens to explore and evangelize in Fujian's tea country in 1835. A similar situation exists in China, where Wu, spoken in southern Jiangsu, northern, and the general area of Shanghai Zhejiang by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than French; Yue Chinese, a Chinese regional variety spoken in Guangdong, Hong Kong and nearby areas in China with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of Malaysia), outnumbers Italian in number of speakers.

Fire from the soldiers at Meicheng (then romanized \"Min-tsing\" from its role as the seat of Minqing County) turned back an expedition by Karl Gützlaff and Edwin Stevens to explore and evangelize in Fujian's tea country in 1835. A similar situation exists in China, where Wu, spoken in southern Jiangsu, northern, and the general area of Shanghai Zhejiang by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than French; Yue Chinese, a Chinese regional variety spoken in Guangdong, Hong Kong and nearby areas in China with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of Malaysia), outnumbers Italian in number of speakers. Dialects of the Min dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in Fujian and in nearby Taiwan, but also in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia and Singapore. When Wang Xi then sent the generals Pan Shikui (潘師逵) and Wu Xingzhen (吳行真) to attack Jian, Wang Yanzheng sought aid from Min's northern neighbor Wuyue. Wang Yanzheng then turned around and sought aid from \n\n  Jerry Norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. For instance, Wuzhou is about 120 mi upstream from Guangzhou, but the Yue variety spoken there is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of Taishan, 60 mi southwest of Guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers. In parts of Fujian the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible. Until the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects are spoken. The vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America up to the mid-20th century spoke the Taishan dialect, from a small coastal area southwest of Guangzhou. ; Huizhou, previously included in Wu. ; Pinghua, previously included in Yue. Local varieties of Chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely on the basis of the different evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials: The classification of Li Rong, which is used in the Language Atlas of China (1987), distinguishes three further groups: Some varieties remain unclassified, including Danzhou dialect (spoken in Danzhou, on Hainan Island), Waxianghua (spoken in western Hunan) and Shaozhou Tuhua (spoken in northern Guangdong).\n\n"

These were the top 12 teams from the previous 1966–67 season and the two newly promoted teams Luzern and Bellinzona. Basel, as reigning champions, played a mediocre season. Therefore they finished the season in fifth position. They were seven points behind the trio Zürich, Grasshopper Club and Lugano who all ended the season with 38 points. Basel won 13 of the league 26 games, drawing five, losing eight times, and they scored 49 goals conceding 33. The trio Roberto Frigerio, Helmut Hauser and Dieter Rüefli were the team's top goal scorers in the domestic league, each netted nine times. This was played on 27 June in the Stade Olympique de la Pontaise in Lausanne. After just one test match, Hägler played his domestic league debut for the club in the away game on 16 November 1947 as Basel played a 3–3 draw against Zürich. He scored his first goal for his club on 27 December 1947 during the home game at the Landhof against Locarno in the Swiss Cup. It was Basel's fifth goal as Basel won 5–3. Five of these games were in the Nationalliga A, two in the Swiss Cup and five were friendly games. Stäuble scored his first domestic league goal for his club on 22 February 1948 in the home game against Servette as Basel won 3–2 and it was the winning goal of the match. In Basel's 1948–49 season Stäuble played 23 league games and three in the Cup and scored ten goals in total.\n\n"

Following high school, Smith enrolled in Indiana University where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Public Financial Management prior to working as a financial planner at Galecki Financial Management. Smith left financial services and co-founded 3BG Supply Co. Smith is married to Michaela Smith. His son James took over the farming for his parents until 1874. He moved to another farm east of Lake City at that time, but Peter continued to own this property until his death in 1899. It is not known who built this Italianate style brick house in 1877, or lived here until 1890. Peter and Sarah had relocated to Glidden, Iowa before 1875, where she died. He married a Lake City widow named Mary Orr, and they returned to Lake City in 1881. They eventually built a house on Main Street. He lived here until 1921, when he sold it to the Hatfield's. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\n\n ships longer than most but after his death, the wooden ships that had been the pride of Windsor were being sold at low prices in Italy and Scandinavia as they could afford to run them. \"Windsor,the town that had been noted for the size,number and seaworthiness of vessels built there,had gone by its prime.The days of shipbuilding in Windsor has passed forever\". Bennett Smith's sons Thomas and Charles took over his business after Smith's death in Windsor at the age of 87. Today a detailed mural of the Black Watch is painted on the old Hants Journal building on Gerrish Street in Windsor, N.S.as a proud reminder of the community's shipbuilding heritage.

The album's launch was supported by three sold-out concerts at the Corona Theatre in Montreal on April 15, 16, and 17.

Like the band's previous release, Wooden Arms, the album contains a few unusual instruments, including a glass marimba on one track, but in general features less of the experimental sound, opting instead for \"an eloquent, perhaps deceptive, simplicity\" and more mature production. Writing for The Globe and Mail, music critic Brad Wheeler noted the band's stylistic changes, calling Adventures in Your Own Backyard \"a dreamy bath of chamber-pop and fancy cabaret, less clacky without the kitchen-utensil or bike-wheel percussion of Wooden Arms and slightly more grounded than Close to Paradise\".

The location was chosen for several reasons: the band wanted to return to the city after several years of touring, they felt that they would produce their best work by avoiding the time constraint and stress of recording in a professional studio, and it also allowed Watson to care for his two young children in between recording sessions. However, the album's title refers to more than just the physical location of where it was recorded; \n\n native province of Quebec. In addition, the album's lyrics were intended to provoke the listener into taking a second look at the world around them, which Watson explains by saying, \"'Fundamentally, I’d like to write songs that people can carry with them in their daily life and bring them some sort of adventure. I hope my music can allow people to catch little details, like when they’re walking down the street, and bring a little bit of creativity and magic to the everyday world.'\" Jian Ghomeshi of the CBC Radio One show Q called it a \"really beautiful record\" and predicted that it would garner the band a lot of attention.

On May 1, 2019, McElhinney started for the Carolina Hurricanes in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup playoffs versus the New York Islanders in Round 2 making him the oldest goaltender to make his first career playoff start at 35 years and 343 days of age. On September 25, 2021, McElhinney announced his retirement via Instagram.\n\n"

Secure in his victory, Henry encountered young William Clito, Duke Robert's son, at Falaise. To show he was compassionate, he placed the boy, then about three years old, under the protection of Count Helias. By the time William Clito was seven or eight, he had become the focal point \n\n resistance to Henry I's rule of Normandy and support was growing for William to be Henry's rival for Normandy and perhaps even England. Helias was absent from the castle at the time, but before the Viscount arrived, the boy was taken out of Normandy to join Helias. His death left William I as the only Count of Nevers and William II as his heir apparent. He set out in February 1101 with 15,000 men, but his army failed to take the heavily garrisoned Konya and was virtually wiped out during the disastrous Battle of Heraclea Cybistra. He is believed to have been buried in Chartreuse, where Bernard of Clairvaux attempted and failed to resurrect him. Thomas was the nephew of Thomas of Bayeux, archbishop of York, and the son of the elder Thomas' brother Samson, Bishop of Worcester. Roger II's grandson, William II (also known as William the Good) reigned from 1166 to 1189.

Secure in his victory, Henry encountered young William Clito, Duke Robert's son, at Falaise. To show he was compassionate, he placed the boy, then about three years old, under the protection of Count Helias. By the time William Clito was seven or eight, he had become the focal point \n\n resistance to Henry I's rule of Normandy and support was growing for William to be Henry's rival for Normandy and perhaps even England. Helias was absent from the castle at the time, but before the Viscount arrived, the boy was taken out of Normandy to join Helias. His death left William I as the only Count of Nevers and William II as his heir apparent. He set out in February 1101 with 15,000 men, but his army failed to take the heavily garrisoned Konya and was virtually wiped out during the disastrous Battle of Heraclea Cybistra. He is believed to have been buried in Chartreuse, where Bernard of Clairvaux attempted and failed to resurrect him.

Despite rain in the early part of his performance, deadmau5 performed to what the Rolling Stone described as an \"enraptured\" audience in a mood akin to \"a glowing Woodstock\".

He was totally cool, totally calm, accepted it all and had a good time doing it. It was beautiful. \", Cantrell said: \"Yeah. He's heard this song. It was shot at a concert. Tyler Joseph sits in a bathroom singing the song, he then shaves off all of his hair, puts on a ski mask, and heads out to the stage where Josh Dun is seen playing drums. Joseph surfs the crowd to the platform and performs the rest of the song on stage with Dun. As the song ends, Joseph is seen by himself on the stage and the crowd is gone. Joseph then sings the final lyrics to the song, in which he falls backwards off the stage and the screen turns to black, ending the video. En pointe. He was gone again before any of us could move.\" The Osheaga Music and Arts Festival (Festival musique et arts Osheaga) is a multi-day indie music festival in Montreal, Quebec, that is held every summer at Parc Jean-Drapeau on Île Sainte-Hélène. The 2006 festival attracted a crowd of around 25,000 people. The 2012 festival reached its 40,000 attendance capacity each day. The festival, organized by Charles Khabouth's INK Entertainment, features two neighboring stages and performances by about thirty or so different artists. The event is named after \"The Veldt\", a song by the deadmau5 and a veld, \"an Afrikaans word for an open grassland... not unlike the vast field in Downsview Park.\" The festival was attended by a crowd numbering around 20,000 concertgoers. Despite rain in the early part of his performance, deadmau5 performed to what the Rolling Stone described as an \"enraptured\" audience in a mood akin to \"a glowing Woodstock\". As the rain eventually stopped, the DJ would perform a 90-minute set which included songs such as the festival's namesake \"The Veldt\", \"Aural Psynapse\" and \"Strobe\".\n\n"

Generals Pinedo and Izquierdo were ordered to lead the troops to control the demonstration, but they disobeyed and joined the demonstration as leaders instead. The quick reaction was possible because of the active intervention of Encarnación Ezcurra, wife of Rosas.

Was your family prosperous, enabling you go on through education? Not very prosperous. When my father came back from the war, the money that his father had left for him to go university had gone, so he had to work his way through dental school.

Serna's relations with Viceroy De la Pezuela further deteriorated. (De la Pezuela was an absolutist and De la Serna a liberal.) De la Serna finally asked to be relieved so that he could retire to Spain. Permission was received in May 1819, and in September he resigned the command of the army to General José Canterac.

It is specifically indicated for infections caused by certain bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterobacter cloacae. It's important to note that the FDA did not approve Plazomicin for treating bloodstream infections due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness in this specific indication. For example, it has demonstrated synergy with daptomycin or ceftobiprole against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA). In clinical trials comparing Plazomicin to meropenem (another antibiotic), it was found to be noninferior, meaning it was equally effective in treating the specified infections. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance regarding medications and their appropriate use.\n\n"

They value the overall ecosystem approach rather than species-specific approaches, consistent with regional and international laws, policies, guidelines and strategies. One way to deal with this problem is to establish wildlife sanctuaries and isolate humans from animals to ensure the safety of both parties. First, huge reserves, \n\n In fact, there are just two large enough wildlife sanctuaries to self-regulate, Kruger National Park and Kgalagadi Park in South Africa. Although the Dinokeng game reserve has successfully managed the total number of lions through selective contraception, the reserve must address the existence of too many young men. In \n\nA strong relationship exists between an indigenous people or local community, and a specific site (territory, ecosystem, species habitat). ; The people's or community's management decisions and efforts lead to the conservation of habitats, species, genetic diversity, ecological functions/ benefits and associated cultural values, even when the conscious objective of management is not conservation (i.e., it may be livelihoods, security, safeguarding \n\n Tourism is an increasingly important industry in Botswana, accounting for almost 12% of GDP. One of the world's unique ecosystems, the Okavango Delta, is located in Botswana. The country offers excellent game viewing and birding both in the Delta and in the Chobe National Park—home to one of the largest herds of free-ranging elephants in the world. A number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife and wetlands, are major tourist attractions. The main safari destinations for tourism are Moremi Game Reserve in the Okavango Delta, and Chobe National Park. Botswana is also participating in community-based natural resource management projects by trying to involve villagers in tourism. One example is the village of Khwai and its Khwai Development Trust.\n\n"

After being elected, the national socialists undertook a series of rapid steps to abolish democracy. Their trade policy in Germany consisted of an autarkic policy regime that aimed to cancel all imports, such as foodstuffs, that could be replaced with domestic substitutes or raw materials for the consumer-oriented industries. Both the persecuted and non-persecuted German groups suffered from these autarkic and trade-restraining policies. Schiller's success in the Grand Coalition helped to give the SPD an electoral victory in 1969 and a chance to form a new coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei—FDP) under Willy Brandt. The SPD-FDP coalition expanded the West German social security system, substantially increasing the size and cost of the social budget. Securing materials for armaments production and the control of food markets were two areas where the German government was involved from the start of the conflict. Private corporations were created under the supervision of the government to oversee specified industries and manage the supply and distribution of foodstuffs. There were around 200 of these corporations by the end of the war, representing an unprecedented level of cooperation between government and the private sector. The insatiable demands on manpower led to yet more government intervention and triggered a massive redistribution of the workforce from \"peacetime\" industries to war industries and \n\nTo improve the livelihoods of smallholder tree-crop commodity farmers who have a low likelihood of earning a living income in the short to medium term, there are several potential interventions that can be considered. This could involve providing farmers with access to resources such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural training to increase their crop yields and productivity. By late 1982, Schmidt's coalition government collapsed as the FDP withdrew to join a coalition led by Helmut Kohl, the leader of the CDU/CSU. The government proceeded to implement new policies to reduce the government role in the economy and within a year won a popular vote in support of the new course. Within its broad policy, the new government had several main objectives: to reduce the federal deficit by cutting expenditures as well as taxes, to reduce government restrictions and regulations, and to \n\n many German companies stayed outside the cartels because they did not welcome the restrictions that membership imposed. The government played a powerful role in the industrialization of the German Empire founded by Otto von Bismarck in 1871 during a period known as the Second Industrial Revolution. Even where the national government did not act, the highly autonomous regional and local governments supported their own industries. The beginning of \n\nTo support farmers in areas of food insecurity and ultimately increase food harvest and reduce food prices, there are several measures that can be taken. Reference:\n- \"For the individual...\"\n\n minister for economics, Karl Schiller, argued strongly for legislation that would give the federal government and his ministry greater authority to guide economic policy. In 1967 the Bundestag passed the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth, known as the Magna Carta of medium-term economic management. That law, which remains in effect although never again applied as energetically as in Schiller's time, provided for coordination of federal, Land, and local budget plans in order to give fiscal policy a stronger impact. The law also set a number of optimistic targets for the four basic standards by which West German economic success \n\n Chancellor Hans Luther had resigned on 13 May 1926 following a controversy over the use of the Reichsflagge and refused to remain in office as caretaker. Deputy-Chancellor Otto Gessler thus stepped in for him and was asked by president Paul von Hindenburg to form a new government.

Their trade policy in Germany consisted of an autarkic policy regime that aimed to cancel all imports, such as foodstuffs, that could be replaced with domestic substitutes or raw materials for the consumer-oriented industries. Both the persecuted and non-persecuted German groups suffered from these autarkic and trade-restraining policies. Schiller's success in the Grand Coalition helped to give the SPD an electoral victory in 1969 and a chance to form a new coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei—FDP) under Willy Brandt. The SPD-FDP coalition expanded the West German social security system, substantially increasing the size and cost of the social budget. Securing materials for armaments production and the control of food markets were two areas where the German government was involved from the start of the conflict. Private corporations were created under the supervision of the government to oversee specified industries and manage the supply and distribution of foodstuffs. There were around 200 of these corporations by the end of the war, representing an unprecedented level of cooperation between government and the private sector. The insatiable demands on manpower led to yet more government intervention and triggered a massive redistribution of the workforce from \"peacetime\" industries to war industries and \n\nTo improve the livelihoods of smallholder tree-crop commodity farmers who have a low likelihood of earning a living income in the short to medium term, there are several potential interventions that can be considered. This could involve providing farmers with access to resources such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural training to increase their crop yields and productivity. By late 1982, Schmidt's coalition government collapsed as the FDP withdrew to join a coalition led by Helmut Kohl, the leader of the CDU/CSU. The government proceeded to implement new policies to reduce the government role in the economy and within a year won a popular vote in support of the new course. Within its broad policy, the new government had several main objectives: to reduce the federal deficit by cutting expenditures as well as taxes, to reduce government restrictions and regulations, and to \n\n many German companies stayed outside the cartels because they did not welcome the restrictions that membership imposed.

In 1967 the Bundestag passed the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth, known as the Magna Carta of medium-term economic management.

Entering the Town of Wish, Lyra finds out that her hometown is completely isolate as everyone has left. She enters her \n\n for her brother Tristis; Finn, a young, timid Capilli sorcerer whose village is beset by a curse cast by Umbra; Norah, Aurora's stepsister, who was pulled through the mirror to Lemuria; Robert, a Populi trader skilled in archery; and Rubella's also jester brother Tristis. They are later joined by Óengus, a Kategida who was exiled when he pledged himself to Umbra in exchange for her sparing his clan's lives, and Genovefa, a young Piscean sorceress and one of the remaining survivors of her village. Other characters include Igniculus, a firefly who becomes Aurora's companion; the Queen of Light, the former ruler of Lemuria; the Duke, Aurora's father, and main antagonist Umbra, Queen of the Night, along with her daughters Nox and Crepusculum.

At first, she is ready to attack Lyra and Will but later confesses that the wickedness of the ghosts was the only nourishment given to her and the other harpies by the Authority. The Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia bargain with her that instead of wickedness, the ghosts will tell the harpies true stories from their lives and in exchange will be taken by the harpies to the window Will has opened into the world of the mulefa where the ghosts may peacefully dissolve into particles in the air. The harpies agree to this as, along with the nourishment such stories would provide, they would also keep their honour as they would be performing a useful and respected task.

It was widely distributed and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to concurrently spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Great Britain and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army. In January 1776, only two years after coming to America from England, Thomas Paine published his pamphlet Common Sense calling for independence for the colonies. Common Sense was immensely popular in disseminating these ideas, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the \"custom of nations\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain.

He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the \"consent of the governed\".

In 1972, Rutgers University Press published a compilation of 112 of Caldwell's \"Simeon Stylites\" as In the Record: the Simeon Stylites Columns of William A. Caldwell (1972). Charles Simeon was a friend.

Abdel-Karim Karmah was born in 1572 in Hama, Syria, son of a priest. In his twenties he went to Jerusalem where he entered in the monastery of Saint Michel, a cloister associated with Mar Saba Monastery. After two years of prayer, he was asked by his bishop Simeon to return to Hama where he was ordained deacon and later priest. On 12 February 1612 Karmah was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Aleppo by Patriarch Athanasius II Dabbas, and he took the name of the saint of that day, ‘’Meletios’’. One of his aims as metropolitan was to increase the literacy and the education of his flock and his presbyter, which needed liturgical and religious books in Arabic.\n\n"

The film received the Saturn Awards for Best Direction and Best Science Fiction Film (where it tied with Dark City). It was also nominated for seven Razzie Awards including: Worst Actor (Bruce Willis), Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actress (Liv Tyler), Worst Screen Couple (Tyler and Ben Affleck) and Worst Original Song. Only one Razzie was awarded: Bruce Willis received the Worst Actor award for Armageddon, in addition to his appearances in Mercury Rising and The Siege, both released in the same year as this film. directed by actress Cheryl Hines and based on a screenplay by late writer Adrienne Shelly, who was murdered a year prior to filming, Ryan portrayed a high-powered female attorney who learns that her husband, played by Timothy Hutton, is about to leave their troubled marriage, and decides to hold him captive by duct-taping him to a toilet. The Razzies, which had previously steered clear of politics, received criticism from some quarters for nominating the performances of George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice. (The former two won their awards while Britney Spears won the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress over Rice; her role in Fahrenheit 9/11 is just fifteen seconds long. ) Leading the pack was a tie between the late summer film Catwoman and Fahrenheit 9/11, each of which won four Razzies, even though the latter was not nominated for Worst Picture. Catwoman received the greatest number of nominations (seven), followed by Alexander with six nominations. Nominations were revealed on January 15, 2014, and the winners were announced on March 1, 2014. Kat Halstead of Common Sense Media was a little more sympathetic saying that despite several uses of mild language, \"..many of the situations in the movie are serious [but] there are some warm and funny moments to lighten the tone\".

The Razzies, which had previously steered clear of politics, received criticism from some quarters for nominating the performances of George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice.

Eliza Leslie, who wrote the 1851 edition of Direction for Cookery, used 10 eggs, beat them as lightly as possible, mixed them with a pound of flour, then added the juice of two lemons or three large oranges. This changed the flavor and texture of the cake. Bumpy Cake was created by Sanders Confectionery, of Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1900s and was originally known as \"The Sanders Devil's Food Buttercream Cake\" when it was first introduced. It is made of chocolate devil's food cake that is topped with rich buttercream bumps, and then draped in a chocolate ganache. Now more than a century old, this is a classic confection. In recipes adapted for the home kitchen it can be made by piping the buttercream frosting in thick half-inch \n\n The cake has a reputation as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. Fruitcake was also the traditional wedding cake in the US until the middle of the 20th century. In the 2000s and 2010s, there was more diversity in flavors, but most of them were white or chocolate cake. It is still a special cake, best made several days in advance of an important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas. By the time the cake arrived overseas, the spirits, raisins and cake had fermented into a \n\n 1975 when \"the AP newspaper published an interview with a baker that worked making them for a small fee of $2,000.

It is unique in that unlike most pastries and desserts, no eggs, butter or milk are used to make the cake batter. Wacky cake may have been created as the result of rationing during World War II, when milk and eggs were scarce. Active ingredients in wacky cake include flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, vegetable oil, white vinegar, salt and vanilla extract. The cake may be topped with icing or confectioner's sugar, or even served plain. The cake is a popular delicacy at bake sales in numerous rural regions of the United States. Modern pastry chefs and cake designers use various ingredients and tools to create a cake that usually reflects the personalities of the couple. Marzipan, fondant, gum paste, buttercream, and chocolate are among the popular ingredients used. Cakes are usually priced on a per-person, or per-slice, basis. Prices can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per-person or slice, depending on the pastry chef who is hired to make the cake. In the United States, reality television shows such as Cake Boss and Amazing Wedding Cakes have become popular and are trending in today's popular culture. Chocolate may be used as an ingredient, which along with the banana is an enjoyable flavor combination for some people. An icing or glaze may be used in the cake's preparation, which can include alcoholic beverages such as bourbon in it.\n\nQuestion: Who was mayor of New York when the first cake mix came out?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Eliza Leslie, who wrote the 1851 edition of Direction for Cookery, used 10 eggs, beat them as lightly as possible, mixed them with a pound of flour, then added the juice of two lemons or three large oranges. This changed the flavor and texture of the cake. Bumpy Cake was created by Sanders Confectionery, of Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1900s and was originally known as \"The Sanders Devil's Food Buttercream Cake\" when it was first introduced. It is made of chocolate devil's food cake that is topped with rich buttercream bumps, and then draped in a chocolate ganache. Now more than a century old, this is a classic confection. In recipes adapted for the home kitchen it can be made by piping the buttercream frosting in thick half-inch \n\n The cake has a reputation as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. Fruitcake was also the traditional wedding cake in the US until the middle of the 20th century. In the 2000s and 2010s, there was more diversity in flavors, but most of them were white or chocolate cake. It is still a special cake, best made several days in advance of an important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas. By the time the cake arrived overseas, the spirits, raisins and cake had fermented into a \n\n 1975 when \"the AP newspaper published an interview with a baker that worked making them for a small fee of $2,000. Nowadays, the construction is generally made of corrugated cardboard, often covered with whipped cream or frosting to make them look real.

It is unique in that unlike most pastries and desserts, no eggs, butter or milk are used to make the cake batter. Wacky cake may have been created as the result of rationing during World War II, when milk and eggs were scarce. Active ingredients in wacky cake include flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, vegetable oil, white vinegar, salt and vanilla extract. The cake may be topped with icing or confectioner's sugar, or even served plain. The cake is a popular delicacy at bake sales in numerous rural regions of the United States. Modern pastry chefs and cake designers use various ingredients and tools to create a cake that usually reflects the personalities of the couple. Marzipan, fondant, gum paste, buttercream, and chocolate are among the popular ingredients used. Cakes are usually priced on a per-person, or per-slice, basis. Prices can range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per-person or slice, depending on the pastry chef who is hired to make the cake. In the United States, reality television shows such as Cake Boss and Amazing Wedding Cakes have become popular and are trending in today's popular culture. Chocolate may be used as an ingredient, which along with the banana is an enjoyable flavor combination for some people. An icing or glaze may be used in the cake's preparation, which can include alcoholic beverages such as bourbon in it.\n\n"

George remains at the former mouth of Cooks River. This part of the river course was altered to accommodate the expanding Sydney Airport. Cooks River now connects with Botany Bay at Kyeemagh. The walkway and cycleway beside much of the \"river\" is part of the path connecting Sydney Olympic Park with Botany Bay. and Copmanhurst, the city of Grafton, and the towns of Ulmarra, and Maclean. The Nepean River rises to the south in the Woronora Plateau, and wraps around the western edge of the city. The south and southwest of Sydney is drained by the Georges River, flowing north from its source near Appin, towards Liverpool and then turning east towards Botany Bay. The other major tributary of Botany Bay is the Cooks River, running through the inner-south western suburbs of Canterbury and Tempe. The Georges River estuary separates the main part of Sydney's urban area from the Sutherland Shire. The Lennox River is the proposed name for a waterway located in Sydney's South-Western Suburbs. The existing waterway is the tidal reach of Prospect Creek, a tributary of the Georges River. The proposed river would be 6.5 kilometres (4 mi) long, starting at the confluence of Orphan School Creek and Prospect Creek at Fairfield and flowing to the Georges River emptying into Dhurawal Bay at Garrison Point. The Lennox River would be named in honour of Scottish-Australian stonemason David Lennox who designed and oversaw the construction of the Lansdowne Bridge which crosses this waterway. Rydalmere ferry wharf is on Parramatta River and is served by Sydney Ferries's Parramatta River services from Parramatta to Circular Quay. There are five bus routes operated by State Transit's Ryde Bus Depot that service the area: Victoria Road (A40) is a major route connecting Parramatta with Anzac Bridge and passes through Rydalmere. It intersects with Victoria Road at a flyover interchange on the eastern edge of Rydalmere and crosses the Parramatta River over Silverwater Bridge. The proposed 'Lennox River' name is chosen in honour of Scottish-Australian stonemason David Lennox who was a colonial bridge designer, builder, and master stonemason and a figure of significance having worked on a number of bridge and infrastructure works including the 1833 Mitchell's Pass Crossing Bridge in Glenbrook (Blue Mountains), 1836 Liverpool Weir, 1839 Church Street Bridge in Parramatta and other projects in both Greater Western Sydney and also to the state of New South Wales. Lennox's finest structure however was the Lansdowne Bridge (which crosses this waterway), he designed and oversaw its construction between 1834 and 1836 and as a testament to his engineering and craftsmanship the Hume Highway from Sydney to Melbourne still passes over the bridge today. The bridge also has the largest span of any masonry bridge in Australia and is considered one of the finest \n\n The Parramatta River is an intermediate tide-dominated, drowned valley estuary located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. With an average depth of 5.1 m, the Parramatta River is the main tributary of Sydney Harbour, a branch of Port Jackson.

George remains at the former mouth of Cooks River. This part of the river course was altered to accommodate the expanding Sydney Airport. Cooks River now connects with Botany Bay at Kyeemagh. The walkway and cycleway beside much of the \"river\" is part of the path connecting Sydney Olympic Park with Botany Bay. and Copmanhurst, the city of Grafton, and the towns of Ulmarra, and Maclean. The Nepean River rises to the south in the Woronora Plateau, and wraps around the western edge of the city. The south and southwest of Sydney is drained by the Georges River, flowing north from its source near Appin, towards Liverpool and then turning east towards Botany Bay. The other major tributary of Botany Bay is the Cooks River, running through the inner-south western suburbs of Canterbury and Tempe. The Georges River estuary separates the main part of Sydney's urban area from the Sutherland Shire. The Lennox River is the proposed name for a waterway located in Sydney's South-Western Suburbs. The existing waterway is the tidal reach of Prospect Creek, a tributary of the Georges River. The proposed river would be 6.5 kilometres (4 mi) long, starting at the confluence of Orphan School Creek and Prospect Creek at Fairfield and flowing to the Georges River emptying into Dhurawal Bay at Garrison Point. The Lennox River would be named in honour of Scottish-Australian stonemason David Lennox who designed and oversaw the construction of the Lansdowne Bridge which crosses this waterway. Rydalmere ferry wharf is on Parramatta River and is served by Sydney Ferries's Parramatta River services from Parramatta to Circular Quay. There are five bus routes operated by State Transit's Ryde Bus Depot that service the area: Victoria Road (A40) is a major route connecting Parramatta with Anzac Bridge and passes through Rydalmere. It intersects with Victoria Road at a flyover interchange on the eastern edge of Rydalmere and crosses the Parramatta River over Silverwater Bridge. The proposed 'Lennox River' name is chosen in honour of Scottish-Australian stonemason David Lennox who was a colonial bridge designer, builder, and master stonemason and a figure of significance having worked on a number of bridge and infrastructure works including the 1833 Mitchell's Pass Crossing Bridge in Glenbrook (Blue Mountains), 1836 Liverpool Weir, 1839 Church Street Bridge in Parramatta and other projects in both Greater Western Sydney and also to the state of New South Wales. Lennox's finest structure however was the Lansdowne Bridge (which crosses this waterway), he designed and oversaw its construction between 1834 and 1836 and as a testament to his engineering and craftsmanship the Hume Highway from Sydney to Melbourne still passes over the bridge today. The bridge also has the largest span of any masonry bridge in Australia and is considered one of the finest \n\n The Parramatta River is an intermediate tide-dominated, drowned valley estuary located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. With an average depth of 5.1 m, the Parramatta River is the main tributary of Sydney Harbour, a branch of Port Jackson.

Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration of Shrek's swamp. During production, animators who failed while working on other projects, such as The Prince of Egypt, were often sent to work on Shrek. At the time DreamWorks was founded, producer John H. Williams got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught Jeffrey Katzenberg's attention and the studio decided to make it into a film.

Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name by William Steig. The story follows the titular Shrek (Myers), an ogre who finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Adamson directed this film and also wrote the story. However, he did not direct the next film in the series, Shrek the Third, as he had been contracted by Walden Media to work on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Instead, the film was directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui while Adamson served as executive producer. Chris Weitz adapted the novel and also directed the film. The cast included Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Ian McKellen, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Christopher Lee. Following an Academy Award win for Shrek, director Andrew Adamson began adapting the source material with a 20-page treatment based on his memories of the book.\n\n"

The Local Government Act 1894, paved the way for the creation of the BUDC in 1894, and on the inception of the council, they occupied a building on the main street that had been built in 1878 and was formerly occupied by a co-operative society. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Swinton of Pendlebury was abolished, and Swinton has since 1 April 1974 formed an unparished area of the City of Salford, a metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The local government districts in the Aire Valley up until 1974 were BUDC, Bradford Corporation, Keighley Corporation, Shipley Urban District Council and Skipton Urban District Council. Government Act 1972 led to the abolition of these local authorities and the creation of the West Midlands metropolitan county and its seven metropolitan boroughs (Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall, and Wolverhampton), which came into being on 1 April 1974. However, this new arrangement ultimately proved to be short lived, as the Local Government Act 1985 abolished the metropolitan county councils, the WMCC among them, with effect from 1 April 1986. The 'top tier' West Midlands County Council was abolished in April 1986 via enactment of the Local Government Act 1985. The first place of worship to occupy the site is thought to be a small chapel provided by Lady Godiva. Both she and her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia paid for many religious buildings in the region. After the Norman Conquest, the Anglo-Saxon chapel was replaced by one of sandstone in c.1150. In 1932 it was enlarged by the abolition of the Nuneaton Rural District the Foleshill Rural District and the Solihull Rural District. It also lost territory as the county boroughs of Solihull and Coventry expanded their boundaries. The district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. At the time of its abolition in 1974 Meriden RD consisted of the following civil parishes: \n\n Handforth-cum-Bosden was part of the Stockport Registration District between 1837 and 1877, until it was divided onto the separate parishes of Handforth and Bosden. The parish of Bosden was abolished in 1900, and incorporated into the parish of Hazel Grove and Bramhall. Handforth, along with other towns such as Whitworth, Poynton and Alderley Edge, successfully objected to being part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester when it was formed in 1974, as a result of plans laid out in the Local Government Act 1972. From 1974 until the changes in local government, which occurred in 2009, Handforth was administered by both the Macclesfield Borough Council and the Cheshire County Council. On 1 April 2009, it became part of the Cheshire East unitary authority.\n\n"

The bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death reached France by ship from Italy to Marseille in November 1347, spread through first Southern France and then Northern France and, due to the size of the Kingdom, lasted there several years, as some parts were not affected until the plague was over in others. The Kingdom of France had the largest population of Europe at the time, and the Black Death was a major catastrophe. In Normandie, the plague made it impossible to bury the corpses even in country villages, and each village which was reached by the plague flagged a black flag to warn anyone approaching. In the very Northern parts of France, the Black Death is described in the chronicle of the abbot Gilles li Muisis of Tournai. According to Louis Heyligen the Black Death reached France in December 1347, when a Genovese plague ship from the East was forced to leave its home port of Genova shortly after its return and arrived in Marseilles instead. The ship spread the plague in Marseilles, was forced to leave the city and continued on its way along the coast of Southern France, spreading the plague along its way, as well as from Marseilles West toward Toulouse, and north toward Avignon. In Avignon, the pope arranged religious processions to dampen the wrath of God, as the plague was \n\nThe Black Death had significant effects on both European and Chinese populations. In Europe, the disease caused widespread devastation, eventually killing about a third of the continent's population, which amounted to approximately 25 million people. Cities like Venice and Paris experienced a high death toll, with Venice losing 60% of its population over 18 months, and Paris losing 800 people per day at the peak of the epidemic. In China, the Black Death also had significant consequences, with an estimated death toll of 13 million people. Similar to Europe, the disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the population. However, it is important to note that the Black Death did not solely affect Europe but caused high mortality rates in various regions around the world. Hospitals played a crucial role in caring for the sick, effectively isolating them to protect the well. Overall, the Black Death had profound effects on both European and Chinese populations, causing widespread mortality and social changes. The last epidemic of bubonic plague in France was the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720. During this time, the plague caused a devastating epidemic that resulted in the deaths of approximately 20 million people, which was about a quarter of Europe's population. The massive loss of life caused by the plague led to a population decline, resulting in a shortage of labor and changes in social structures. With a significant reduction in population, there was a subsequent labor shortage which led to increased wages for those who survived. The widespread devastation caused by the Black Death altered people's perceptions of life, death, and religion. The plague's impact on society can be seen in the art, literature, and religious practices of the time. The plague had devastating effects, killing approximately two-thirds of those infected within days. Many times in history we have seen the devastation that a foreign germ can cause in a new population.The disease had originated in Asia, and the European populace had never been exposed to it before, so there was no level of immunity in the general public.First, the germ that caused this disease, Pasteurella pestis, was a new pathogen.Treatment today consists of antibiotics, which of course did not exist during the great plague of Black Death. At the peak of the epidemic, Paris lost 800 people a day. By 1349, half its population of 100,000 people had died. Resurfacing several times over the next century, the Plague pushed forward the rise of hospitals, which helped to control the spread of disease.

According to Louis Heyligen the Black Death reached France in December 1347, when a Genovese plague ship from the East was forced to leave its home port of Genova shortly after its return and arrived in Marseilles instead. The ship spread the plague in Marseilles, was forced to leave the city and continued on its way along the coast of Southern France, spreading the plague along its way, as well as from Marseilles West toward Toulouse, and north toward Avignon. In Avignon, the pope arranged religious processions to dampen the wrath of God, as the plague was \n\nThe Black Death had significant effects on both European and Chinese populations. In Europe, the disease caused widespread devastation, eventually killing about a third of the continent's population, which amounted to approximately 25 million people. Cities like Venice and Paris experienced a high death toll, with Venice losing 60% of its population over 18 months, and Paris losing 800 people per day at the peak of the epidemic. In China, the Black Death also had significant consequences, with an estimated death toll of 13 million people. Similar to Europe, the disease spread rapidly due to the lack of immunity in the population. However, it is important to note that the Black Death did not solely affect Europe but caused high mortality rates in various regions around the world. Hospitals played a crucial role in caring for the sick, effectively isolating them to protect the well. Overall, the Black Death had profound effects on both European and Chinese populations, causing widespread mortality and social changes. The last epidemic of bubonic plague in France was the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720. During this time, the plague caused a devastating epidemic that resulted in the deaths of approximately 20 million people, which was about a quarter of Europe's population. The massive loss of life caused by the plague led to a population decline, resulting in a shortage of labor and changes in social structures. With a significant reduction in population, there was a subsequent labor shortage which led to increased wages for those who survived. The widespread devastation caused by the Black Death altered people's perceptions of life, death, and religion. The plague's impact on society can be seen in the art, literature, and religious practices of the time. The plague had devastating effects, killing approximately two-thirds of those infected within days. Many times in history we have seen the devastation that a foreign germ can cause in a new population.The disease had originated in Asia, and the European populace had never been exposed to it before, so there was no level of immunity in the general public.First, the germ that caused this disease, Pasteurella pestis, was a new pathogen.Treatment today consists of antibiotics, which of course did not exist during the great plague of Black Death. At the peak of the epidemic, Paris lost 800 people a day. By 1349, half its population of 100,000 people had died. Resurfacing several times over the next century, the Plague pushed forward the rise of hospitals, which helped to control the spread of disease. Why did the Black Death cause so much death and disease worldwide but especially in Europe?\n\n"

In fact, The Wealth of Nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes: \"The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.\" Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that \n\n market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. In Stein's reading, The Wealth of Nations could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior\". Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in The Economic Journal that in the 20th-century United States, Reaganomics supporters, The Wall Street Journal, and \n\n specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them luxury-goods taxes and tax on rent. Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\". Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society.

Also known as or  he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at \n\nSome literature: ; An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776 ; The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759 Adam Smith (Great Britain, 1723–1790), often considered the founder of modern economics, was a key figure in formulating and advancing economic doctrine of free trade and competition. In his Wealth of Nations Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was \"one of the great achievements in human intellectual history\". O'Rourke describes Smith as the \"founder of free market economics\". Herbert Stein wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas.

In fact, The Wealth of Nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes: \"The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.\" Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that \n\n market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. In Stein's reading, The Wealth of Nations could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior\". Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in The Economic Journal that in the 20th-century United States, Reaganomics supporters, The Wall Street Journal, and \n\n specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them luxury-goods taxes and tax on rent. Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\". Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch.

Also known as or  he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at \n\nSome literature: ; An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 1776 ; The Theory of Moral Sentiments, 1759 Adam Smith (Great Britain, 1723–1790), often considered the founder of modern economics, was a key figure in formulating and advancing economic doctrine of free trade and competition. In his Wealth of Nations Adam Smith outlined the key idea that if the economy is basically left to its own devices, limited and finite resources will be put to ultimately their most efficient use through people acting purely in their self-interest. Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was \"one of the great achievements in human intellectual history\". O'Rourke describes Smith as the \"founder of free market economics\". Herbert Stein wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas.

In addition to being a tourist attraction Sempor Dam is a source of irrigation water for farmers. It also provides for flood control and has a 1 MW hydroelectric power station at its base. Numerous environmental groups and local villagers have decried the project’s anticipated ecological and social impact. It is 33 kilometers downstream of the confluence of the Moei and Salween Rivers, and about 47 kilometers from the Thai-Myanmar border. It is opposite Mae Hong Son Province in northern Thailand. The portion of the Salween at which the dam will be built features particularly strong rapids, which in the dry season become a waterfall. The dam site is also within the Kahilu Wildlife Sanctuary. The areas surrounding the Hatgyi Dam site are ethnically diverse and ecologically rich. At least 13 different indigenous groups live along the Salween river, and over ten million people are supported by the Salween River basin. The Salween's waters are nutrient-rich and support local vegetation and farmlands. The Bakun Dam is an embankment dam located in Sarawak, Malaysia, on the Balui River, a tributary or source of the Rajang River and some sixty kilometres east of Belaga. The purpose for the dam was to meet growing demand for electricity. However, most of this demand is said to lie in Peninsular Malaysia and not East Malaysia, where the dam is located. This plan envisioned 730 km \n\n (Koica), and the Philippines, through the National Irrigation Administration and the local government of Isabela. The project entailed construction of a 34-meter high earth-filled dam across Pasa River, a reservoir with an active storage of 3.90 million cubic meters, with 5.93 kilometers of a main canal and 16.20 kilometers of lateral canals. It was built to help mitigate floods with its small water impounding or catchment basin \n\n The Pa Sak River (แม่น้ำป่าสัก,, , Pronunciation) is a river in central Thailand. The valley of the Pa Sak through the Phetchabun mountains is a dominant feature of Phetchabun Province. To address drought problems in the lower Pa Sak valley, in 1994 the construction of the Pa Sak Cholasit Dam (เขื่อนป่าสักชลสิทธิ์) in Lopburi Province was built. It is located 19 km east of the town of Sumedang. The primary purpose of the dam is irrigation but it will also provide for flood control, water supply and hydroelectric power generation. The project has become controversial, primarily due to the relocation of people in the future reservoir zone. The inhabitants of the area—primarily Karen tribes people—largely oppose the project. In December 2019, the RID submitted a second environmental impact assessment (EIA) to the Office of the Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). The goal of the project is to support the Kakkayam Hydro electric power project and satisfy the demand for irrigation and drinking water in a region known to have water shortages in seasonal dry periods.
