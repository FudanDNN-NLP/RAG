Although unable to accomplish much due to his lack of a parliamentary majority, the split of the Liberals over Irish Home Rule in 1886 enabled him to return to power with a majority, and, excepting a Liberal minority government (1892–95), to serve as prime minister from 1886 to 1902. Salisbury became prime minister of a minority administration from 1885 to 1886. Salisbury said "Laissez-faire is an admirable doctrine but it must be applied on both sides", as Parliament had enacted new building projects (such as the Thames Embankment) which had displaced working-class people and was responsible for "packing the people tighter": "...thousands of families have only a single room to dwell in, where they sleep and eat, multiply, and die… It is difficult to exaggerate the misery 

 In 1830, following the death of George IV and when the Duke of Wellington resigned on the question of Parliamentary reform, the Whigs finally returned to power, with Grey as prime minister. His term was a notable one, seeing passage of the Reform Act 1832, which finally saw the reform of the House of Commons, and the abolition of slavery throughout almost all of the British Empire in 1833 with the Slavery Abolition Act. While this might have been treated merely as a vote of no confidence in Secretary for War Campbell-Bannerman, Rosebery chose to treat it as a vote of censure on his government. On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895–1905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. Key politicians included future prime ministers Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Winston Churchill, H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George, sceptics of non-interventionism on economy and free market, embraced the New Liberalism. To fund extensive welfare reforms Lloyd George proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the "People's Budget" (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected. He remained as prime minister until Gladstone's Liberals formed a government with the support of the Irish nationalists at the 1892 general election. The Liberals, however, lost the 1895 general election, and Salisbury for the third and last time became prime minister. He led Britain to victory in a bitter, controversial war against the Boers, and led the Unionists to another electoral victory in 1900. He relinquished the premiership to his nephew Arthur Balfour in 1902 and died in 1903. He was the last prime minister to serve from the House of Lords.

 Tennant was Assistant Private Secretary to his brother-in-law H. H. Asquith while the latter was Home Secretary between 1892 and 1895.

He entered the cabinet as Secretary for Scotland under Asquith in July 1916, a post he held until Asquith was ousted as Prime Minister in December 1916.

The separate Australian States show some differences in settlement patterns, as demonstrated in the statistics compiled during the 2006 Census:

 ''' Melbourne is Australia's second largest city and has a diverse and multicultural population. Melbourne dominated Australia's population growth for the 15th year in a row as of 2017, adding 125,424 people between 2016 and 2017, and boomed past 5 million people in 2019. Population growth is however projected to significantly decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic slowdown. Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia. Melbourne is home to residents from 200 countries and territories, who speak over 233 languages and dialects and follow 116 religious faiths. The earliest known inhabitants of the broad area that later became known as Melbourne were Indigenous Australians – specifically, at the time of European settlement, the Bunurong, Wurundjeri and Wathaurong tribal groups. Melbourne is still a centre of Aboriginal life — consisting of local groups and indigenous groups from other parts of Australia, as most indigenous Victorians were displaced from their traditional lands during colonization – with the Aboriginal community in the city numbering over 20,000 persons (0.6% of the population). In 2018, the population of the Melbourne metropolitan area was 4,963,349. Although Victoria's net interstate migration has fluctuated, the population of the Melbourne statistical division has grown by about 70,000 people a year since 2005. Until 2020, Melbourne had attracted the largest proportion of international overseas immigrants (48,000) finding it outpacing Sydney's international migrant intake on percentage, along with having strong interstate migration from Sydney and other capitals due to more affordable housing and cost of living. After a trend of declining population density since World War II, the city has seen increased density in the inner and western suburbs, aided in part by Victorian Government planning, such as Postcode 3000 and Melbourne 2030, which have aimed to curtail urban sprawl. As of 2018, the CBD is the most densely populated area in Australia with more than 19,000 residents per square kilometre, and the inner city suburbs of Carlton, South Yarra, Fitzroy and Collingwood make up Victoria's top five. The number is projected to reach 1.4 billion by 2030, exhibiting annual growth rate of 3 percent. On the basis of geography, the global dementia drugs market can be segmented into six major regions: North

 Canberra is Australia's capital and its largest inland city. This amounted to only 1.7% of Australia's population. The population density for Canberra is 443.5 people per sq kilometre. At the 2016 census, 32% of Canberra's population were born overseas, a large majority which come from Asia and Europe. The estimated population for Canberra as of 2016 was 395,790, constituting 194,879 males and 200,914 females. Compared with Australia's other state capitals, Adelaide is growing at a rate similar to Sydney, Canberra, and Hobart (see List of cities in Australia by population). In 2020, it had a metropolitan population (including suburbs) of more than 1,376,601, making it Australia's fifth-largest city. Some 77% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states. Major areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as Mawson Lakes and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached,

The men's marathon event at the 1928 Summer Olympics took place in Amsterdam, Netherlands on Sunday, August 5, 1928. It was also the United States' first track and field gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, after a few initial days of failure. Brown Trafton's gold medal in Beijing was more broadly notable for being the first American gold in the event for 76 years. It was the second American gold in the event, after Copeland's gold at the Depression-handicapped 1932 Summer Olympics.

 The field for the competition was a square measuring 12 feet by 12 feet, which could be constructed by teams for practising prior to competitions. In the centre of the field there is a vertically constructed set of pegs, which are arranged in a three-by-three grid (as a tic-tac-toe board). The field is also divided into two triangular sides, one red and one blue. This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction.

[2024-06-14 14:53:11,047] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: As all Olympic marathons, the competition was a single race. The 1908 course (the first Olympic marathon at the now-standard marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards) was not used. The first marathon was perhaps a 25 mile run by Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran to Athens from the town of Marathon, Greece to deliver news of a battle victory over the Persians in 490 B.C. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period. The marathon distance had not yet been standardized; in St. Louis, the course was 24.85 miles (40 km). St. Louis organizers started the marathon at 3 pm, whereas most contemporary marathons start in the early morning to take advantage of cooler times of day. Arthur L. Newton of the United States was the only runner from 1900 to return, while other significant American runners included the winners of the past three Boston Marathons: 1902 winner Sammy Mellor, 1903 winner John Lordon, and 1904 winner Michael Spring. Cuba and South Africa each made their first appearance in the event, while the United States was the only nation to have runners in each of the first three Olympic marathons. The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who happened to be in St. Louis as part of the South African exhibit at the 1904 World's Fair. In April 1944 he finished third in 2:38:31 at Boston to four-time winner Canada's Gérard Côté and two-time champion (and seven-time runner up) John A. Kelley. Nine years later, he ran Boston in 2:43:56. On November 12, 1944, while in the U.S. Navy, he also won the U.S. national marathon championship at the Yonkers marathon, running 2:40.48.6. The first running of the marathon was held in 2002. When Sherm Miller, who worked for the St. George City Parks and Recreation Department, returned to St. George after running the Deseret News Marathon in Salt Lake City, he was inspired to host a marathon in St. George. Although others were not as enthusiastic about the idea, he was allowed to hold his marathon. Of the 58 who started the race, only 38 reached the finish line, a finish line on a course that was later 

 As all Olympic marathons, the competition was a single race. The now-standard marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards was run over a course that "started and ended at the Olympic Stadium, but was not strictly out-and-back, as there were small loops near the halfway point, and on the return to the Stadium." The race was the idea of Tommy Leonard, an avid runner and popular bartender in Boston and Falmouth. During the 1972 Summer Olympics Leonard closed his bar in order to watch Frank Shorter win the first Olympic marathon for the United States since 1908. After Shorter won the marathon Leonard was quoted as saying "Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could get Frank Shorter to run in a race on Cape Cod?" One year later, in the summer of 1973, with the help of a local high school track coach John Carroll, and the town's recreation director Rich Sherman, the first Falmouth Road Race was run by approximately 100 people. The next year there were 445 runners, and the year after that Frank Shorter joined 850 other runners in the race, bringing Leonard's wish true.

About 20 km from the city is Mount Kenya National Park. The mountain has two main snow-covered peaks – Batian (5 200 m) and Nelion (5 188 m). It is the highest mountain in the country and the second, after Kilimanjaro, in Africa. Batian Peak, the highest peak of Mount Kenya (5,199 metres or 17,057 feet) and highest point in Kenya

 There are several routes by which to reach Kibo, or Uhuru Peak, the highest summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, namely: Marangu, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame. Continue around the rim (which will take about two hours for fit climbers) to Uhuru Peak (5895 m) the highest point in Africa. Descend to Kibo Hut and then down to the thicker air and relative warmth of Horombo hut. The Marangu Route (also known as the "Coca-Cola" route) is the easiest ascent of Kilimanjaro, although any ascent can be challenging. It crosses The Saddle, a 5 km wide, high-altitude, semi-desert that separates craggy Mawenzi from the main summit Kibo. At the summit, there is a sign posted by the Tanzanian government.

Continue around the rim (which will take about two hours for fit climbers) to Uhuru Peak (5895 m), the highest point in Africa. Descend to Kibo Hut and then down to the thicker air and relative warmth of Horombo hut. However, some tours skip this and proceed directly from Simba camp to a 'Third Camp' at around 3700m to Kibo Hut, resulting in a (more difficult because of shorter length) 5-day total trip. It is, after Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru, the third-highest mountain in Tanzania if Kilimanjaro's three peaks are considered to be one mountain. In Africa a major trekking destination is Mount Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano in Tanzania, which is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain in the world: 5895 m above sea level and about 4900 m above its plateau base.

The flag was abandoned in Libya in 1977 after Muammar Gaddafi established the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and adopted a green flag. Syria adopted a new flag in 1980 and Egypt in 1984. These are the Pan-Arab colors. The flag is similar to the flags of Jordan, the Kingdom of Iraq, and Western Sahara, all of which draw their inspiration from the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule (1916–1918). The flag of the Arab Revolt had the same graphic form as the Flag of the Arab Federation and Palestine, but the colors were arranged differently (white on the bottom, rather than in the middle). However, after the Libyan Civil War in 2011, Libya changed its flag to the new one which was used from 1951 to 1969 back when Libya was a Kingdom. The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. In the early 1990s, the Libyan passport was valid to all countries in the world, except South Africa, and what was claimed as the "occupied Palestine" (which included the Palestinian territories and Israel). The color of the passport was green, representing Libya's past flag, and features the Hawk of Quraish in the middle.

Under Muammar Gaddafi's leadership, Libya had a red-white-black flag from 1969 to 1977, and it was replaced by the all-green flag from 1977 to 2011, during which it was the only flag in the world to have one color and no design. During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad. The flag of Libya descends from the pan-Arab colors, while the flag of the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was independently derived.

During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad. The flag of Libya descends from the pan-Arab colors, while the flag of the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was independently derived. Omar Faiek Shennib is credited for the design of the independence Flag of Libya: this flag represented Libya from its independence until 1951 to 1969, and which was re-adopted by the rebel movement during the 2011 Libyan Civil War.

She wrote the book as an apologia to defend her husband from perceived attacks, and to preserve his legacy. However it has been used by academic historians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to examine a variety of topics related to Edith Wilson. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical The Monthly Review, when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic".

 The Story of My Life, first published in 1903, is Helen Keller's autobiography detailing her early life, especially her experiences with Anne Sullivan. In 2001, Bruce Clayton, writing in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, described the memoir as a "self-serving apologia". It presents Edith in a very positive light yet also tied her importance directly to her husband, ending when he died in 1924. Phyllis Lee Levin attributes to Edith and her memoir the creation of a public opinion of that "mythologiz[ed] her husband's goals and reputation as ennobled prophet, warrior, and statesman." bridal suite for Arthur Henley Keller's second wife, who bore him Helen Keller in 1880.

Tumulty (whom she personally disliked). In the memoir, she emphasizes that her husband's doctors urged Edith to serve as "steward" of the presidency. The film is based on a book by Nicholas Monsarrat that nearly had Helen Keller's co-workers suing for libel due to perceived parallels between Helen's story and Esther's.

 Thomas Mallon (born November 2, 1951) is an American novelist, essayist, and critic. He is the author of nine books of fiction, including Henry and Clara, Two Moons, Dewey Defeats Truman, Aurora 7, Bandbox, Fellow Travelers, Watergate, Finale, and most recently Landfall. He has also published nonfiction on plagiarism (Stolen Words), diaries (A Book of One's Own), letters (Yours Ever) and the Kennedy assassination (Mrs. Paine's Garage), as well as two volumes of essays (Rockets and Rodeos and In Fact). He is a former literary 

 Truman Capote decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party. For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in high society. According to Capote's friend, the writer and editor Leo Lerman, Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writer's colony Yaddo that when he, Capote, became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends. Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the ball's legend. Capote's friend, author Dominick Dunne, had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary. Capote attended with Alvin Dewey and others he had met while researching In Cold Blood.

 Sherwood was the son of the common clerk John Shirwod of York and his first wife, Agnes. He was a papal lawyer, and then a diplomat, when he became the first permanent English ambassador, resident from 1479 in Rome. He was nominated on 29 March 1484, with Richard III on the throne, and probably was consecrated on 26 May 1484. He visited Rome twice more as ambassador: in 1487, with Thomas Linacre and William Tilly of Selling; and in 1492-3, when he died there. His successor, Innocent III (1198–1216), was a militant opponent of the Cathar heresy, which had infiltrated the city, and took measures to eradicate that heresy; Innocent III sent Pietro Parenzo to govern the city, who was quickly martyred. He was elected in opposition to William Cumin who had been intruded into the see by King David I of Scotland in 1141. Cumin was never consecrated and by 1143 had been excommunicated by Pope Innocent II who also ordered a new election to be held at York Minster. It was this election which selected William of St. Barbara. In the meantime, rumors of Adrian VI's death spread in Rome and Francis I began to prepare for a new conclave. The cardinals did not bring a fisherman's ring with them to Spain, to ensure that Adrian VI would be forced to travel to Rome, where he arrived on August 28. Adrian VI said mass every day for the year he was pope, in contrast to his two predecessors who may have never celebrated mass at all. Robert Pullen (1144–1146) ; Nicholas Breakspeare, elected Pope Adrian IV (1149–1154) 

 Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman ever to have been elected Pope, was born on a farm in Bedmond or Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire, probably around 1100. Nicholas was refused permission to become a monk at St Albans, but his career does not seem to have suffered for this, and he was unanimously elected Pope on 2 December 1154, taking the papal name Adrian IV. He was the Pope who placed Rome under an interdict, and is famous for his alleged Donation of Ireland to the English throne. His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Ealdred was made bishop 

 His year and place of birth are unknown, but this is presumed to be Rome, where his family was already well-represented in the Roman Curia. He and cardinal Soffredo were made papal legates to Philip II of France and Henry II of England, negotiating a two-year truce between them. The school takes its name from the 12th-century priest St Albans-born and educated Nicholas Breakspear, who, as Pope Adrian IV, is the only Englishman ever to have occupied the papal chair.

Adrian VI said mass every day for the year he was pope, in contrast to his two predecessors who may have never celebrated mass at all. Robert Pullen (1144–1146) ; Nicholas Breakspeare, elected Pope Adrian IV (1149–1154) 

 Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman ever to have been elected Pope, was born on a farm in Bedmond or Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire, probably around 1100. Nicholas was refused permission to become a monk at St Albans, but his career does not seem to have suffered for this, and he was unanimously elected Pope on 2 December 1154, taking the papal name Adrian IV. He was the Pope who placed Rome under an interdict, and is famous for his alleged Donation of Ireland to the English throne. His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Ealdred was made bishop 

 His year and place of birth are unknown, but this is presumed to be Rome, where his family was already well-represented in the Roman Curia. He and cardinal Soffredo were made papal legates to Philip II of France and Henry II of England, negotiating a two-year truce between them. The school takes its name from the 12th-century priest St Albans-born and educated Nicholas Breakspear, who, as Pope Adrian IV, is the only Englishman ever to have occupied the papal chair.

Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned that program's highest rank, Eagle Scout. Surveys of historians and political scientists have ranked Ford as a below-average president. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship.

The trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon.

In December 1973, two months after the resignation of Spiro Agnew, Ford became the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment.

Ford was involved in the Boy Scouts of America, and earned that program's highest rank, Eagle Scout. Surveys of historians and political scientists have ranked Ford as a below-average president. In retirement, Ford set aside the enmity he had felt towards Carter following the 1976 election, and the two former presidents developed a close friendship. Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.) was born on July 14, 1913. Serving from 1973 to 1974 as the 40th Vice President of the United States, Ford was the first person appointed to the vice-presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment. Ford is the only President of the United States who was not elected by ballot for his terms as either President or Vice-President. A 41-cent Gerald Ford memorial commemorative stamp was issued on August 31, 2007, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Palm Springs, California. Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.; July 14, 1913 – December 26, 2006) was the 38th president of the United States, serving from 1974 to 1977, and the 40th vice president of the United States serving from 1973 to 1974.

  Ford is the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president. The choice of Ford to fill the vacant vice-presidency was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. "In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. The trust the American public had in him was rapidly and severely tarnished by his pardon of Nixon. Ford won the approval of both houses by huge margins, and was sworn in as the 40th vice president of the United States on December 6, 1973. Throughout life, Ford remained interested in his school and football; he occasionally attended games. Ford graduated from Michigan in 1935 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.

 Beverly Hills Cop III is a 1994 American action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by John Landis, who had previously worked with Murphy on Trading Places and Coming to America. The film features a number of cameo appearances by well-known film personalities, including Robert B. Sherman, Arthur Hiller, John Singleton, Joe Dante, Barbet Schroeder, Peter Medak, special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, and George Lucas as a ride patron. The film was considered by critics and Murphy himself as the weakest film in the trilogy. Murphy played Jim Harvey, whose horse Tumbleweed displayed a talent for getting the hero out of any scrape. Director Nathan Juran oversaw Tumbleweed, as well as Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River. As Murphy's film career began to progress, so did his efforts to improve his skills. When Hugh O'Brian bet $500 that he could draw a gun faster than anyone in Hollywood, Murphy raised the ante to $2500 and wanted to use live ammunition; O'Brian did not accept. Murphy reneged on the deal and the film was never made. The film's cast was rounded out with Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. Dillon is a cleaner for a gangster named Eddie (Gabriel Byrne) and has been sent to assist Ray should he require it. As Dillon and 

 In 1933, a man named Chaney (Charles Bronson) witnesses a bare-knuckled street fight. Chaney and a suitably impressed Speed travel to New Orleans to match Chaney against local fighters at long odds, recruiting genteel but slightly decrepit cutman, Poe (Strother Martin) to tend to his wounds. Not long afterward, he reprised his role of Axel Foley in the Tony Scott-directed Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). By the end of the decade, Murphy was Hollywood's biggest box office star. In 1988, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises company had struck a deal with CBS. Universal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week. He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring his wife Wanda Hendrix, and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James. He and director Budd Boetticher become acquainted through Terry Hunt's Athletic Club where Murphy would request to be his boxing partner. Murphy appeared in the 1951 title role of Boetticher's first westernThe Cimarron Kid. The only film Murphy made in 1952 was Duel At Silver Creek with 

 From 1989 onwards, critical praise for Murphy's films declined, hitting a low point with the critically-panned Beverly Hills Cop III (1994), a movie Murphy would ultimately denounce during an appearance on Inside the Actors Studio. On Harlem Nights (1989), Murphy worked as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, Charlie Murphy. The film featured Murphy's comic idols Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in supporting roles.

The film features a number of cameo appearances by well-known film personalities, including Robert B. Sherman, Arthur Hiller, John Singleton, Joe Dante, Barbet Schroeder, Peter Medak, special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, and George Lucas as a ride patron. The film was considered by critics and Murphy himself as the weakest film in the trilogy. Murphy played Jim Harvey, whose horse Tumbleweed displayed a talent for getting the hero out of any scrape. Director Nathan Juran oversaw Tumbleweed, as well as Gunsmoke and Drums Across the River. As Murphy's film career began to progress, so did his efforts to improve his skills. When Hugh O'Brian bet $500 that he could draw a gun faster than anyone in Hollywood, Murphy raised the ante to $2500 and wanted to use live ammunition; O'Brian did not accept. Murphy reneged on the deal and the film was never made. The film's cast was rounded out with Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. Dillon is a cleaner for a gangster named Eddie (Gabriel Byrne) and has been sent to assist Ray should he require it. As Dillon and 

 In 1933, a man named Chaney (Charles Bronson) witnesses a bare-knuckled street fight. Chaney and a suitably impressed Speed travel to New Orleans to match Chaney against local fighters at long odds, recruiting genteel but slightly decrepit cutman, Poe (Strother Martin) to tend to his wounds. Not long afterward, he reprised his role of Axel Foley in the Tony Scott-directed Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). By the end of the decade, Murphy was Hollywood's biggest box office star. In 1988, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises company had struck a deal with CBS. Universal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week. He wrapped up that year making Sierra starring his wife Wanda Hendrix, and Kansas Raiders as outlaw Jesse James. He and director Budd Boetticher become acquainted through Terry Hunt's Athletic Club where Murphy would request to be his boxing partner. Murphy appeared in the 1951 title role of Boetticher's first westernThe Cimarron Kid. The only film Murphy made in 1952 was Duel At Silver Creek with 

 From 1989 onwards, critical praise for Murphy's films declined, hitting a low point with the critically-panned Beverly Hills Cop III (1994), a movie Murphy would ultimately denounce during an appearance on Inside the Actors Studio. On Harlem Nights (1989), Murphy worked as director, producer, star, and co-writer, with his brother, Charlie Murphy. The film featured Murphy's comic idols Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in supporting roles.

 Empire of the Sun is a 1987 American epic coming-of-age war film based on J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical 1984 novel of the same name. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers.

Rising Sun is a 1992 novel by Michael Crichton. Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, Rising Sun deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture.

 The film's opening scene is set in 1943 Japan. The story flashes back to 1936 when Taro Seki returns to Japan after studying in America, with plans to work for an American engineer, Clancy O'Hara (Don Douglas).

The airport opened in 1972, replacing a former Imperial Japanese Navy airfield in the Kamoike area near the city center, which had served as the city's main airport since 1957. The site of the former airport was re-developed as a "new town" with office buildings and high-density housing projects, and is now the site of the Kagoshima Prefecture government office, among other buildings. The airport's runway had an initial length of 2,500 m, which was extended to 3,000 m in 1980.

 "The Wanderer" is a song by American singer Donna Summer, released as the lead single from her 1980 eighth album of the same name, which was the first for her new label Geffen Records after recording her previous albums with Casablanca Records. Despite the label change, Summer continued to work with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, who had produced the majority of her hits in the late 1970s. However, it marks a change in style for The Queen of Disco, incorporating new wave styled synth riffs and a shuffling beat. This first 45 from the album became a big hit for Summer in the United States, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 for 3 weeks. Five of the ten songs of the album are from two successful movies by the singer: Grease (1978) and Xanadu (1980).

Wilson performed the song live with the Beach Boys from the late 1970s onwards. The song combines elements of two previously recorded rock songs: "Baby, I Love Your Way", a number-12 Billboard Hot 100 hit from 1976 by British-born singer Peter Frampton, and "Free Bird" by American Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, which reached number 19 on the Hot 100 chart in 1975.

The Lion Bridge is in the Admiralteysky District of St. Petersburg, connecting the Kazansky and Spassky Islands. The structure, suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of lions, was constructed in 1825 according to the design of two well-established bridge builders, Tratter and Kristianovich. It is an outstanding monument of bridge-building architecture of the first quarter of the 19th century [5]. Queensborough Bridge is a highway bridge in New Westminster, British Columbia. It was built in 1960 by the City of New Westminster, costing $4 million. The bridge spans the north arm of the Fraser River for road access from the main part of New Westminster to the suburb of Queensborough at the east end of Lulu Island, giving the bridge its name. Two road bridges (the Lions' Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) connect to the city of Vancouver and the Trans-Canada Highway. The only other road access is by way of Highway 99 from the north or the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal from Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast. The point, which as its name suggests, is a viewpoint, landmark and tourist attraction in Stanley Park and has a restaurant and other facilities, is just west of the Lions Gate Bridge. The location of the point is known in the Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) language as Chay-thoos, meaning "high bank". The Burrard Street Bridge (sometimes referred to as the Burrard Bridge) is a four-lane, Art Deco style, steel truss bridge constructed in 1930–1932 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The high, five part bridge on four piers spans False Creek, connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends. The other two bridges are the Granville Bridge, three blocks or 0.5 km to the southeast, and the Cambie Street Bridge, about 11 blocks or 2 km to the east. Some parts of the bridge (balls and rosettes of the fence, shaped parts of lanterns, etc.) to that used on the Lions' Gate Bridge, with the number of lanes varied depending on traffic flow and volume. Oversized commercial vehicles are prohibited from using the bridge, as mandated by the British Columbia Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement agency. At the entrances to the bridge, sculptures of lions are installed on cast-iron pedestals. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4200 ft between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the "Bay Bridge"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at 76 ft wide by 58 ft high. There are four major bridges: the Lions Gate Bridge, connecting to the North Shore municipalities and the Trans Canada Highway, and the Burrard Street Bridge, Cambie Street Bridge, and Granville Street Bridge, which provide access to the commercial and residential areas south of False Creek.

[2024-06-14 14:53:26,261] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: In Greek mythology, Sterope (Ancient Greek: Στερόπη, from στεροπή, steropē, lightning) was a daughter of Cepheus, king of Tegea in Arcadia. She received from Heracles a lock of the Gorgon Medusa's hair to help her protect her hometown, Tegea from attack thus the hero won Cepheus' friendship. Out of sadness and regret, she created the palladium, a statue in the likeness of Pallas, and wrapped the aegis, which she had feared, about the breast of it, and set it up beside Zeus and honored it. This story about Athena and Pallas inspired a yearly festival in Libya dedicated to the goddess. They celebrate a yearly festival of Athena, 

 In one archaic myth, related only in the Iliad by the goddess Dione to her daughter Aphrodite, two chthonic giants, the Aloadae, named Otus and Ephialtes, bound Ares in chains and imprisoned him in a bronze urn, where he remained for thirteen months, a lunar year. Ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him, and Artemis tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other. In Nonnus's Dionysiaca Ares also killed Ekhidnades, the giant son of Echidna, and a great enemy of the gods. "It produced a sound as from myriad roaring dragons (Iliad, 4.17) and was borne by Athena in battle ... and among them went bright-eyed Athene, holding the precious aegis which is ageless and immortal: a hundred tassels of pure gold hang fluttering from it, tight-woven each of them, and each the worth of a hundred oxen." Virgil imagines the Cyclopes in Hephaestus' forge, who "busily burnished the aegis Athena wears in her angry moods—a fearsome thing with a surface of gold like scaly snake-skin, and the linked serpents and the Gorgon herself upon the goddess's breast—a severed head rolling its eyes", furnished with golden tassels and bearing the Gorgoneion (Medusa's head) in the central boss. Some of the Attic vase-painters retained an archaic tradition that the tassels had originally been serpents in their representations of the 

  Hesiod, in the Theogony (c. 700 BC), described three Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who were the sons of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), and the brothers of the Titans and Hundred-Handers, and who had a single eye set in the middle of their foreheads. They made for Zeus his all-powerful thunderbolt, and in so doing, the Cyclopes played a key role in the Greek succession myth, which told how the Titan Cronus overthrew his father Uranus, and how in turn Zeus overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and how Zeus was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos. The names that Hesiod gives them: Arges (Bright), Brontes (Thunder), 

 According to the Theogony of Hesiod, Uranus (Sky) mated with Gaia (Earth) and produced eighteen children. First came the twelve Titans, next came the three one-eyed Cyclopes: "Then [Gaia] bore the Cyclopes, who have very violent hearts, Brontes (Thunder) and Steropes (Lightning) and strong-spirited Arges (Bright), those who gave thunder to Zeus and fashioned the thunderbolt. In Hesiod's Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who made for Zeus his weapon the thunderbolt. Mentions of the Hesiodic and the wall-builder Cyclopes also figure in his plays. The third-century BC poet Callimachus makes the Hesiodic Cyclopes the assistants of smith-god Hephaestus. In Hesiod's Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, sons of Uranus and Gaia, who made for Zeus his characteristic weapon, the thunderbolt. In Homer's Odyssey, the Cyclopes are an uncivilized group of shepherds, one of whom, Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, is encountered by Odysseus. A scholiast, quoting the fifth-century BC historian Hellanicus, tells us that, in addition to the Hesiodic Cyclopes (whom the scholiast describes as "the gods themselves"), and the Homeric Cyclopes, there was a third group of Cyclopes: the builders of the walls of Mycenae.

  Hesiod, in the Theogony (c. 700 BC), described three Cyclopes: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who were the sons of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), and the brothers of the Titans and Hundred-Handers, and who had a single eye set in the middle of their foreheads. They made for Zeus his all-powerful thunderbolt, and in so doing, the Cyclopes played a key role in the Greek succession myth, which told how the Titan Cronus overthrew his father Uranus, and how in turn Zeus overthrew Cronus and his fellow Titans, and how Zeus was eventually established as the final and permanent ruler of the cosmos. The names that Hesiod gives them: Arges (Bright), Brontes (Thunder), 

 According to the Theogony of Hesiod, Uranus (Sky) mated with Gaia (Earth) and produced eighteen children. First came the twelve Titans, next came the three one-eyed Cyclopes: "Then [Gaia] bore the Cyclopes, who have very violent hearts, Brontes (Thunder) and Steropes (Lightning) and strong-spirited Arges (Bright), those who gave thunder to Zeus and fashioned the thunderbolt. In Hesiod's Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who made for Zeus his weapon the thunderbolt. Mentions of the Hesiodic and the wall-builder Cyclopes also figure in his plays. The third-century BC poet Callimachus makes the Hesiodic Cyclopes the assistants of smith-god Hephaestus. In Hesiod's Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, sons of Uranus and Gaia, who made for Zeus his characteristic weapon, the thunderbolt. In Homer's Odyssey, the Cyclopes are an uncivilized group of shepherds, one of whom, Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, is encountered by Odysseus. A scholiast, quoting the fifth-century BC historian Hellanicus, tells us that, in addition to the Hesiodic Cyclopes (whom the scholiast describes as "the gods themselves"), and the Homeric Cyclopes, there was a third group of Cyclopes: the builders of the walls of Mycenae.

The record was set on October 23, 1970 by the American Gary Gabelich with Blue Flame, a rocket car on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Richard Noble stepped up to "bring back this record for Britain". The time it took Richard Noble from the idea to the first concept to the successful record attempt was nine years. Thrust2 is a British designed and built jet propelled car, which held the world land speed record from 4 October 1983 to 25 September 1997. In 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his earlier car Thrust2, which reached a speed of 1,019 km/h.

As an important contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s, he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th century. Hockney has owned residences and studios in Bridlington and in London, as well as two residences in California, where he has lived intermittently since 1964: one in the Hollywood Hills, one in Malibu, and an office and archives on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California. On 15 November 2018, Hockney's 1972 work Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold at Christie's auction house in New York City for $90 million (£70 million), becoming the most expensive artwork by a living artist sold at auction. Hockney held this record until 15 May 2019 when Koons reclaimed the honour selling his Rabbit for more than $91 million at Christie's in New York. The oil paintings he produced after 2005 were influenced by his intensive studies in watercolour, a series titled Midsummer: East Yorkshire (2003–2004).

 Hockney returned more frequently to Yorkshire in the 1990s, usually every three months, to visit his mother who died in 1999.

In 1998, he completed the painting of the Yorkshire landmark, Garrowby Hill.

 David Hockney was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Laura and Kenneth Hockney (a conscientious objector in the Second World War), the fourth of five children. He was educated at Wellington Primary School, Bradford Grammar School, Bradford College of Art (where his teachers included Frank Lisle and his fellow students included Derek Boshier, Pauline Boty, Norman Stevens, David Oxtoby and John Loker  ) and the Royal College of Art in London, where he met R. B. Kitaj. At the Royal College of Art, Hockney featured in the exhibition Young Contemporaries – alongside Peter Blake – that announced the 

 work, including 150 paintings, drawings, prints, sketchbooks, and photocollages from over five decades. Hockney assisted in displaying the works and the exhibition, which ran until January 2007, was one of the gallery's most successful.

 Bigger Trees Near Warter or ou Peinture en Plein Air pour l'age Post-Photographique is a large landscape painting by British artist David Hockney. Measuring 180 by, it depicts a coppice near Warter, Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire and is the largest painting Hockney has completed. It was painted in the East Riding of Yorkshire between February and March 2007. The painting's alternative title alludes to the technique Hockney used to create the work, a combination of painting out of doors and in front of the subject (called in French ‘sur le motif’) whilst also using the techniques of digital photography. Jason Wilsher-Mills is a digital artist from Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. Art Mills compares his art to the Beano comic strip and Ken Loach's I, Daniel Blake. In 2021, he created a statue called 'I Am Argonaut', for the Folkestone Triennial, an art festival held in Kent. Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times, the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism, one of Hockney's major aims—discussing the way human vision works.

Daley was elected to a record sixth term as mayor by a landslide 59% margin. This was the first Chicago mayoral election since the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Only one other individual (Daley's son Richard M. Daley) has matched Daley's feat of winning six Chicago mayoral elections. One of Richard J. Daley's fiercest enemies in the Council during his tenure, Hoellen was known for his bravado and acerbic wit. He ran unsuccessfully against Daley for Clerk in 1955, as well as in the 1975 Chicago mayoral election. Doody was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives and sworn into office on September 11, 1995 to succeed Ed Zabrocki, the Mayor of Tinley Park, Illinois, who had been elected in the 1994 elections. While Byrne had previously, in 1979, presented herself as a protegee of former mayor Richard J. Daley, she now blamed him for many of the city's financial shortcomings. Daley's own son Richard M. Daley capitalized off a desire which many Chicagoans held (despite Byrne's criticisms) to return to what they perceived to have been comparatively stable years which the city had experienced under Richard J. Daley's leadership. Despite there being a black candidate in the race, the Chicago Defender endorsed Daley, as did noted African American publisher John H. Johnson. As a candidate, Harahan regularly attacked Daley for what he regarded to be Daley's, "arrogance of total political power." During the campaign, Daley refused to appear at events which featured other contenders.

 Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, became mayor in 1989, and was repeatedly reelected until he declined to seek re-election in 2011. New projects during Daley's administration have been designed to be environmentally sound, more accessible and better for their occupants. When Daley officially launched his campaign in September 1982, polls showed him ahead of or tied with Byrne. The fact that neither Byrne nor Daley were able to consolidate the white electorate around their candidacy provided Washington an opportunity to win a plurality of the overall vote. In the Chicago mayoral election of 1971, Richard J. Daley was elected to a fifth term as mayor, defeating Republican Richard Friedman by a landslide 40% margin. In winning his fifth mayoral election, Daley tied the record set by both Carter Harrison Sr. and Carter Harrison Jr. for the most Chicago mayoral election victories. Daley faced weak opposition in the election, with no serious challengers arising. The Daley family has had a strong presence in Chicago mayoral politics. Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley both served as mayor. Richard J. Daley's son (and Richard M. Daley's brother) William Daley unsuccessfully ran in the 2019 mayoral election, finishing third in the first round of voting.

Each trainset is equipped with automated guide-way transit (AGT) technology. The system consists of two parallel tracks, North and South, each providing bidirectional service. The north track is served by a single car for passport controlled passengers only. The south track serves both passport controlled passengers and the general public, separated by platform dividers between the cars. An extension is underway towards the future third terminal building, at which time the skytrain service will be limited to airport staff and passport-checked passengers only. The Soekarno–Hatta Airport Skytrain (Kalayang Bandara Soekarno–Hatta) is a driverless 3.05 kilometre Automated People Mover System (APMS) which connects Soekarno-Hatta Airport Terminals 1, 2, 3 and SHIA railway station, free of charge. Skytrain takes 5 minutes from one terminal to another, with 7 minutes needed to get from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. It will be operated by Asia Era One Company Limited, a special-purpose vehicles by the consortium of Charoen Pokphand Group Company, Limited (CP) and partners Ch. The MRT Blue Line presently runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 people in each direction per hour. Similar to the Skytrain, the Metro uses trains supplied by Siemens which travel up to 80 km/h. Passengers can connect to the Skytrain at Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park stations. The 48-kilometer-long MRT Blue line will serve as a circle line for Bangkok's metro rail system, providing connections to all other major lines, including the SRT Red Lines and the Airport Rail Link. So to ride the complete circle one has either to start at Tha Phra or change trains there. The Dumbarton Rail Bridge lies just to the south of the Dumbarton road bridge. Built in 1910, the rail bridge was the first structure to span San Francisco Bay, shortening the rail route between Oakland and San Francisco by 26 mi. The last freight train traveled over the bridge in 1982, and it has been proposed since 1991 to reactivate passenger train service (connecting Caltrain on the Peninsula with ACE, BART and the Capitol Corridor in the East Bay) to relieve traffic on the road bridges, though this would entail a complete replacement of the existing bridge. Part of the western timber trestle approach collapsed in a suspected arson fire in 1998. Oregon Route 18 connects to McMinnville, the county seat, and beyond to the Portland metropolitan area to the east. Willamette & Pacific Railroad provides freight rail service to the city, but there is no passenger rail in the city. There is public transportation via Yamhill Community Action Partnership with a bus to McMinnville. There were to be three phases: the first a north–south line from Hua Lamphong Railway Station, Bangkok's main train station, to Don Mueang International Airport; the second an east–west line from Taling Chan District to Hua Mak; and the third a spur to the port.

Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:53:34 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: The system uses Airport Automated People Mover System rubber-tyred metro manufactured by state-owned enterprise PT LEN Industri in cooperation with South Korean Woojin Industries. Each trainset is equipped with automated guide-way transit (AGT) technology. The system consists of two parallel tracks, North and South, each providing bidirectional service. The north track is served by a single car for passport controlled passengers only. The south track serves both passport controlled passengers and the general public, separated by platform dividers between the cars. An extension is underway towards the future third terminal building, at which time the skytrain service will be limited to airport staff and passport-checked passengers only. The Soekarno–Hatta Airport Skytrain (Kalayang Bandara Soekarno–Hatta) is a driverless 3.05 kilometre Automated People Mover System (APMS) which connects Soekarno-Hatta Airport Terminals 1, 2, 3 and SHIA railway station, free of charge. Skytrain takes 5 minutes from one terminal to another, with 7 minutes needed to get from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. It will be operated by Asia Era One Company Limited, a special-purpose vehicles by the consortium of Charoen Pokphand Group Company, Limited (CP) and partners Ch. The MRT Blue Line presently runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 people in each direction per hour. Similar to the Skytrain, the Metro uses trains supplied by Siemens which travel up to 80 km/h. Passengers can connect to the Skytrain at Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park stations. The 48-kilometer-long MRT Blue line will serve as a circle line for Bangkok's metro rail system, providing connections to all other major lines, including the SRT Red Lines and the Airport Rail Link. So to ride the complete circle one has either to start at Tha Phra or change trains there. The Dumbarton Rail Bridge lies just to the south of the Dumbarton road bridge. Built in 1910, the rail bridge was the first structure to span San Francisco Bay, shortening the rail route between Oakland and San Francisco by 26 mi. The last freight train traveled over the bridge in 1982, and it has been proposed since 1991 to reactivate passenger train service (connecting Caltrain on the Peninsula with ACE, BART and the Capitol Corridor in the East Bay) to relieve traffic on the road bridges, though this would entail a complete replacement of the existing bridge. Part of the western timber trestle approach collapsed in a suspected arson fire in 1998. Oregon Route 18 connects to McMinnville, the county seat, and beyond to the Portland metropolitan area to the east.

Lasky, Cecil B. DeMille, and Arthur Friend formed a partnership, The Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, to produce feature-length motion pictures. In 1914, Paramount was a film exchange and exhibition corporation headed by W. W. Hodkinson. Looking for more movies to distribute, Paramount signed a contract with the Lasky Company on June 1, 1914 to supply 36 films per year. In addition to its own name, Paramount has several subsidiaries with names resembling those of Hollywood companies, including Fox Drilling, Summit Resources, and Pixar Petroleum. Paramount initially released it as a silent film, to accommodate smaller regional theaters that were not yet equipped for sound. They would later release a sound version, informally referred to as a "talkie". Paramount had a special department for the sole purpose of counting and answering every incoming fan letter. Two years later, he left to form his own distribution company, Alco Films, however it entered bankruptcy a year later when his partner absconded with most of the assets so Lichtman rejoined Zukor to form Artcraft Pictures. Artcraft was later merged with Paramount and others into Famous Players-Lasky with Lichtman becoming general manager. He also had to work with a tight shooting script as Paramount executives Adolph Zukor and Jesse L. Lasky insisted the film be brought on schedule and on budget. Sam Goldfish, who changed his name to Sam Goldwyn, was the driving force in the company. On 10 March 1922 Sam Goldwyn was voted out of the presidency of the company by the board of directors. The company was merged in 1923 with Metro Pictures to become Metro-Goldwyn Pictures, then renamed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after Louis B. Mayer took control. Around 1920, Pantages entered into partnership with the motion picture distributor Famous Players, a subsidiary of film producer Paramount Pictures, and further expanded his "combo" houses, designed to exhibit films as well as staging live vaudeville, to new sites in the western U.S. In the late 1920s, with the looming advent of talking pictures, David Sarnoff, the principal of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which held a number of patents in film/sound technology, established the film production company Radio Pictures, in which Joseph P. Kennedy held an option and a managing interest, and moved to acquire control of the KAO theatres through quiet purchases of the company's stock. In 1927, Kennedy and Sarnoff were successful in gaining control of KAO and, in 1928, changed the name of the company to Radio Keith Orpheum (RKO). They then approached Alexander Pantages with an offer to purchase his entire chain. The Fox Film Corporation (also known as Fox Studios) was an American independent film company that produced motion pictures, formed by William Fox in 1915. It was the corporate successor and spin-off to his earlier Greater New York Film Rental Company and Box Office Attractions Film Company. The company's first film studios were set up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but in 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood, California to oversee the studio's new West Coast production facilities, where the climate was more hospitable for filmmaking. On July 23, 1926, the company bought the patents of the Movietone sound system for recording sound onto film.

Several men were charged 

 On March 16, 1968, three companies of Task Force Barker, part of the Americal Division, took part in a search and destroy operation near the village of My Lai, in Quang Ngai Province. The killings ended only when an American helicopter crew, headed by Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr., discovered Calley's unit in the act and threatened to attack them with his aircraft's weapons unless they stopped. One of the soldiers on the scene was Ron Haeberle, a photographer for the newspaper Stars and Stripes, who took unobtrusive official black-and-white photos of the operation through the lens of 

 the killings, but only Calley was convicted. Although My Lai generated a lot of civilian recriminations and bad publicity for the military, it was not the only massacre.

William R. Peers was appointed by the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff to conduct a thorough review of the My Lai Massacre. Zeiger's My Lai Massacre documents the Vietnam War mass murder of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops in Sơn Tịnh District, South Vietnam, on 16 March 1968. Zeiger reveals what he calls a "secret" of the Vietnam War, that My Lai was not unusual for U.S. forces but actually routine. He quotes Army Specialist 5 Ronald L. Ridenhour, who wrote a letter in March 1969 to thirty members of Congress imploring them to investigate the massacre, as saying "this was an operation, not an aberration." The Hà My Massacre was a massacre purportedly conducted by the South Korean Marines on 25 February 1968 of unarmed citizens in Hà My village, Điện Dương commune, Điện Bàn District, Quảng Nam Province in South Vietnam. The massacre was purportedly conducted by the 2nd Marine Division. According to South Korean anthropologist Heonik Kwon, it was reportedly conducted in retaliation for 

 The National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. war crimes in Vietnam was founded in New York by Ralph Schoenman in November 1969 to document American atrocities throughout Indochina.

Ridenhour was the soldier who sent the letter to Congress that sparked the investigation into the My Lai Massacre. The Green Beret Affair began when Chu Van Thai Khac, a South Vietnamese agent suspected of being a double agent, was abducted by three Special Forces soldiers, drugged, shot and his body dumped in Nha Trang bay.

The Vietnam War Crimes Working Group Files made public in 1994 by the "Freedom of Information Act" reveals seven, albeit much smaller, massacres previously unacknowledged by the Pentagon, in which at least 137 civilians had died.Civilian Killings Went Unpunished Cover-ups may have occurred in other cases, as detailed in the Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles concerning the Tiger Force of the 101st Airborne Division by the Toledo Blade in 2003. William R. Peers was appointed by the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff to conduct a thorough review of the My Lai Massacre. Zeiger's My Lai Massacre documents the Vietnam War mass murder of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops in Sơn Tịnh District, South Vietnam, on 16 March 1968. Zeiger reveals what he calls a "secret" of the Vietnam War, that My Lai was not unusual for U.S. forces but actually routine. He quotes Army Specialist 5 Ronald L. Ridenhour, who wrote a letter in March 1969 to thirty members of Congress imploring them to investigate the massacre, as saying "this was an operation, not an aberration." The Hà My Massacre was a massacre purportedly conducted by the South Korean Marines on 25 February 1968 of unarmed citizens in Hà My village, Điện Dương commune, Điện Bàn District, Quảng Nam Province in South Vietnam. The massacre was purportedly conducted by the 2nd Marine Division. According to South Korean anthropologist Heonik Kwon, it was reportedly conducted in retaliation for 

 The National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. war crimes in Vietnam was founded in New York by Ralph Schoenman in November 1969 to document American atrocities throughout Indochina. The formation of the organization was prompted by the disclosure of the My Lai Massacre on November 12, 1969 by Seymour Hersh, writing for the New York Times. Ridenhour was the soldier who sent the letter to Congress that sparked the investigation into the My Lai Massacre. The Green Beret Affair began when Chu Van Thai Khac, a South Vietnamese agent suspected of being a double agent, was abducted by three Special Forces soldiers, drugged, shot and his body dumped in Nha Trang bay. On learning of the murder, eight men were arrested including 5th Special Forces Group commander, Colonel Robert B. Rheault. Both declined to get 

 Tien 40 was conducted by the ARVN 23rd Division in Quang Duc Province. The story of the 1968 My Lai Massacre was revealed to the public by freelance American investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, who was contributing to the Dispatch News Service.

 1969 saw humanity step onto another world for the first time. On 20th July 1969, the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, Eagle, landed on the Moon's surface with two astronauts aboard. There were four Apollo missions in total in 1969, three of which traveled to the Moon, with Apollo 12 also landing on the surface. Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as "one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 11 effectively proved US victory in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth." The Apollo program was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. During the Apollo 11 mission, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24, 1969.

Stevens later acknowledged that he had essentially written the lyrics to the music of American jazz multi-instrumentalist Yusef Lateef's "The Plum Blossom", from his 1961 Eastern Sounds. Stevens indicated that he "told Yusef Lateef about it, gave him a big cheque, and in fact, started paying him royalties." The song is now released with credits that include Yusef Lateef. The song lyric was written by American Kim Fowley, and Stevens was asked to collaborate by composing music for it. "MacArthur Park" is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb that was recorded first by Irish actor and singer Richard Harris in 1968. "MacArthur Park" was subsequently covered by numerous artists, including a 1969 Grammy-winning version by country music singer Waylon Jennings and a number one Billboard Hot 100 disco arrangement by Donna Summer in 1978. In 1967, producer Bones Howe had asked Webb to create a pop song with different movements and changing time signatures. Webb delivered "MacArthur Park" to Howe with "everything he wanted", but Howe did not care for the ambitious arrangement and unorthodox lyrics and the song was rejected by the group the Association, for whom it had been intended. A mural on the Wildwood boardwalk (painted in 2014) honors Rydell whose song put the community into the national spotlight. Harris recorded several albums of music, one of which, A Tramp Shining, included the seven-minute hit song "MacArthur Park" (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as "MacArthur's Park"). This song was written by Jimmy Webb, and it reached number 2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart. "MacArthur Park" sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. In the 1973 TV special "Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La", after singing Webb's "Didn't We", Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey. "Strange Fruit" is a song written and composed by Abel Meeropol and recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939. The lyrics were drawn from a poem by Meeropol published in 1937. Meeropol set his lyrics to music with his wife and the singer Laura Duncan and performed it as a protest song in New York City venues in the late 1930s, including Madison Square Garden. The song was inspired by Somerset Street in Belmont, Massachusetts, a wooded road running adjacent to the land owned by McLean Hospital where Taylor had committed himself in 1965 to receive treatment for depression. Taylor's friend Danny Kortchmar said "Country Road": "captures the restless, anticipatory, vaguely hopeful feeling that plays a large part on James' character and appears in 'Carolina in My Mind,' 'Blossom', and 'Sweet Baby James.'

Question: Who wrote the song MacArthur Park?
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:53:40 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:in his own memoir, Jennings agreed:  The Kimberlys were a quartet consisting of two brothers from Oklahoma and their wives, who are also sisters. Jennings intended to gain for them a wider audience with this album. Three of the songs on the album are written or co-written by Harold Gay, one of the members. The album is best remembered for its version of Jimmy Webb's "MacArthur Park," which rose to #23 on the Billboard country charts and won a Grammy for Best 

 The song was written in collaboration between Cross, pop music composer Burt Bacharach, and Bacharach's frequent writing partner and then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. A fourth writing credit went to Minnelli's ex-husband, Australian songwriter Peter Allen, also a frequent collaborator with Bayer Sager: the line "When you get caught between the moon and New York City" from the chorus was taken from an unreleased song Allen and Bayer Sager had previously written together. Allen came up with the line while his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The song won the 1981 Academy Award for Best Original Song and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Speaking of the song's titular character, MacColl told Smash Hits in 1983: "Terry seems to be a really good name for a lovable rogue. Armstrong said it took "a long time" to write the song.

It was the follow-up to her #1 US hit "My Love," which had been the title selection from the aforementioned album, and it continued her association with writer/producer Tony Hatch and songwriter Jackie Trent.

Clark's next UK single "You're the One" would boost her UK chart profile considerably with a #23 peak but it would be the subsequent "My Love" - ironically a record the singer disliked - which would consolidate the stardom augured for Clark by "Downtown". The 1967 album release Pet Project by the Bob Florence Big Band features an instrumental version of "Round Every Corner", the album being devoted to songs associated with Petula Clark. The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan and the Breakaways vocal group. Beginning with her American breakout, "Downtown," Clark's singles had all had higher chart peaks in the US than in the UK. Although this trend was reversed with Clark's next single: "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" (UK #6/US #9), Clark's last two 1966 single releases: "Who Am I?" In South Africa "Sailor" would twice become a Top Ten hit for Clark, first reaching #2 in its original 1961 release and subsequently afforded a #9 chart peak via a local re-release in the summer of 1968. The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan, along with vocal group the Breakaways, and was introduced by Clark on her BBC variety series, This Is Petula Clark. "I Couldn't Live Without Your Love" was the first single by Clark to reach #1 on the US Easy Listening chart. A sales total of 250,000 units for Clark's "Sailor" was announced by Pye Records the week of 18 February 1961 when the single was in its second week at #2: on the chart for the following week: that of 23 February 1961, Clark's "Sailor" moved to the #1 position of the UK chart, besting 

 "I Know a Place" is a song with music and lyrics by Tony Hatch. It was recorded in 1965 by Petula Clark at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured drummer Bobby Graham and the Breakaways vocal group. Released as the follow-up to "Downtown", which it strongly resembles both in musical structure and the story conveyed by the lyrics, "I Know a Place" became Clark's second consecutive Top Ten hit in the United States, remaining on the charts for twelve weeks. 9, 

 While overall conforming to the hit formula Hatch had come up with for Clark with "Downtown" - and being especially reminiscent of Clark's 1965 #1 hit "My Love - "Colour My World" acknowledged the sound of the later 1960s by featuring a riff played on the sitar. Recorded in New York City, "Colour My World" was rush released in December 1966 in an attempt to counteract the disappointing performance of Clark's preceding single "Who Am I?" which had fallen short of the US Top 20 and more seriously had become the first Petula Clark single since "Downtown" (1964) to not rank in the UK Top 50. "Chalk up another chart topper in this intriguing Hatch-Trent rhythm number featuring the popular Indian sitar sound and exceptional Clark vocal work." Although Clark had become a fixture on the upper realms of the U.S. charts through her collaboration with writer/producer Tony Hatch on "Downtown", her UK singles chart success had been more hit-and-miss. This made the strong UK showing of "This Is My Song"—Clark's first single release since "Downtown" to be neither written nor produced by Hatch—the more remarkable. The follow-up single "Don't Sleep in the Subway" resumed the Clark/Hatch collaboration and was a UK hit (#12) but, like all Clark's releases after "This Is My Song", would fail to return her to the UK Top Ten. It combines cover versions of popular songs of the era and original material, much of it written by Clark and Tony Hatch, who produced the recording and arranged it along with Johnny Harris and Frank Owens.

This left only a few seconds of film before Jimi began his set. All that remains of that historic night are seconds of a video of Jimi plugging into his amps, pictures taken by few professional photographers, and a horrible distorted audio recording that's barely audible. By most eyewitness accounts, the Harlem crowd was slow to warm up to Jimi, with someone even throwing an object on stage. On August 18, 1969, Jimi Hendrix performed the American National Anthem “Star Spangled Banner” at Woodstock. Immediately after the performance, it was taken out of context by media outlets and considered to be a controversial, unorthodox rendition, and with possible protest of the Vietnam War. On September 9, 1969, Hendrix later specified he played it because he was “An American” and “thought it was Beautiful” and the performance was not in relation to political protest. Hendrix's performance as "a staggering display of blues guitar playing that is worthy of mention in the same breath as his later efforts with the Experience". In 1966, during his residency as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Cafe Wha? in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became "Red House". He played driving rhythm and virtuosic lead lines simultaneously and sang over it all. His guitar was heavily modified. Williams added a rudimentary electric pickup, whose wires coiled all over the top of his guitar. It was used as the closing number at a Saville Theatre show in London on June 4, 1967. Hendrix "ended the gig by smashing a guitar handed to him for the finale ... and hurling it into the audience". The show was dubbed a "farewell" concert by Shapiro and Glebbeek, before the band headed to the US and their appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. A performance recorded at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, on October 10, 1968, was released on the 1982 The Jimi Hendrix Concerts album. In an effort to out-do the Who's destruction of their instruments earlier at the same event, Hendrix poured lighter fluid over his guitar and set it on fire, even though "I'd just finished painting it that day" as he would later remark. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine included this in their list of "50 Moments That Changed Rock & Roll" alongside Townshend's first guitar smashing in 1964. "Electric Church Red House" is a jam from TTG Studios in Los Angeles featuring a group introduction by Hendrix (lifted from another, different jam at TTG) and Lee Michaels on organ. The Jimi Hendrix Experience gave a dramatic performance of the song, at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967: in the documentary Monterey Pop, Jimi Hendrix lit his guitar on fire at the song's conclusion. Live recordings by Hendrix are found on several albums; more recently, the Monterey version is included on Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001) and Live at Monterey (2007).

 Peter Edmund Hillary (born 26 December 1954) is a New Zealand mountaineer, philanthropist and writer. He is the son of adventurer Sir Edmund Hillary, who, along with mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, completed the first successful ascent of Mount Everest. When Peter Hillary summited Everest in 1990, he and his father were the first father/son duo to achieve the feat. Hillary has achieved two summits of Everest, an 84-day trek across Antarctica to the South Pole, and an expedition guiding astronaut Neil Armstrong to land a small aircraft at the North Pole. He went on to complete the first winter ascent of Crowberry Ridge Direct and of Raven's Gully on Buachaille Etive Mòr in the Scottish Highlands, with Chris Bonington in 1953. Although further from the mountains, he continued climbing and taking pupils on expeditions. In 1957 Bryant was killed in a road traffic accident. Remembering Bryant's climbing skills and good humour, which he ascribed to his New Zealand heritage, and hearing of Ed Hillary's success on his first Himalayan expedition, he invited Hillary to join the party.

In 2002, he and Peter Hillary, the son of Edmund Hillary, were part of an expedition to climb Everest and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first ascent. Norgay went on to write Touching My Father's Soul, a book documenting his experiences on the summit attempt. The book was notable for the frankness with which it discussed the relationship between the often wealthy climbers and the Sherpas who obtain their incomes from assisting expeditions. Norgay's book was the first to discuss from the Sherpas' point of view of the disastrous May 1996 climbing season, in which twelve climbers died.

By 1896, Isabella and Jack Gardner recognized that their house on Beacon Street in Boston's Back Bay, although enlarged once, was not sufficient to house their growing collection of art, including works by Botticelli, Vermeer, and Rembrandt. After Jack's sudden death in 1898, Isabella realized their shared dream of building a museum for their treasures.

18 March – Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft: Twelve paintings, collectively worth from $100 to $300 million, are stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts by two thieves posing as police officers. Bernard Berenson purchased the painting on behalf of collector Isabella Stewart Gardner. It hung in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, prior to being stolen on March 18, 1990. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was constructed under the guidance of art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) to house her personal art collection. The museum opened to the public in 1903, and Gardner continued to expand the collection and arrange it until she died in 1924. She left the museum with a $3.6 million endowment, and her will stipulated that the arrangement of the artwork should not be altered and no items were to be sold or bought into the collection. This financial strain left the museum in poor condition; it lacked a climate control system and an insurance policy, and was in need of basic building maintenance. She first became an overseer, then in 2006 a trustee of the museum. Some time after 2012, Burr and other heirs of Bettina Looram donated a collection of 186 objects, originally in the collection of Alphonse and Clarice de Rothschild, that were looted by the Nazis following the Austrian Anschluss with Germany in 1938.

Oscar stars Sylvester Stallone, in a rare attempt at a comedic role, as Angelo "Snaps" Provolone, a mob boss who promises his dying father that he will leave the world of crime and become an honest businessman. Alongside Stallone, the film's cast includes Marisa Tomei, Ornella Muti, Tim Curry and Chazz Palminteri. Its score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. According to Landis, Oscar was stylistically influenced by older Hollywood comedies, particularly those belonging to the "screwball" genre, that were popular during the period in which the film takes place.

The film stars Geoffrey Rush, Lynn Redgrave, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Noah Taylor, John Gielgud, Googie Withers, Justin Braine, Sonia Todd, Nicholas Bell, Chris Haywood, and Alex Rafalowicz.

The conclusion reveals that as he watches the truck, he is himself watched and evaluated by the sinister doctor (Jürgen Prochnow) who cloned him. Activating a cloaking device too late, the spaceship crashes into the Atlantic Ocean, near Manhattan. The aliens from the planet Remulak aboard, Beldar Clorhone and his "genetomate", Prymaat, survive and quickly adapt to the human way of life, despite standing out with their conical-shaped heads and metallic-sounding voices.

It also revived the popularity of Davis and Crawford as box office draws, and led to a sub-genre of horror movies starring elder actresses nicknamed "Psycho-biddy".

 role of Mildred Rogers had been rejected by several actresses, but Davis achieved critical acclaim for her performance. In 1936, convinced her career would be ruined by appearing in mediocre films, Davis walked out on her Warner Brothers contract, and decided to make films in England. Davis explained her viewpoint to a journalist, saying: "I knew that, if I continued to appear in any more mediocre pictures, I would have no career left worth fighting for." She eventually settled her disagreements with Warner Brothers, and returned to the studio in 1937. Hughes lent her to RKO to star in many films (another source says Greer's husband, Rudy Vallee, "helped her get out of her contract with Hughes and secure another pact with RKO Studios" ) including Dick Tracy (1945), Out of the Past (1947), They Won't Believe Me (1947), and the comedy/suspense film The Big Steal (1949), with Out of the Past co-star Robert Mitchum. Hughes refused to let her work for a time; when she finally resumed film acting, she appeared in You're in the Navy Now (1951), The Prisoner of Zenda (1952), Run for the Sun (1956), and Man of a Thousand Faces (1957). In 1952, Greer obtained a release from her contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. Emboldened by his recent commercial successes, Aldrich announced a $14 million production program of eight films, including Cross of Iron, Whatever Happened to Cousin Charlotte, The Tsar's Bride, Brouhaha, The Legend of Lylah Clare, Paper Eagle, Genghis Khan's Bicycle, and There Really Was a Gold Mine a sequel to Vera Cruz. Davis was to be reunited with Joan Crawford, but Crawford left the film and was replaced by Olivia de Havilland. The movie was popular, though not as successful as Baby Jane. After North's contract with Fox ended in 1958, her career stalled, although she continued to act in films, television, and on the stage throughout the rest of her life. Norman appeared in her only leading role in 1951, playing Martha Crawford in The Well. She later appeared in supporting roles in Torch Song (1953), Bright Road (1953), Susan Slept Here (1954), The Opposite Sex (1956), and Written on the Wind (1956). One of her more memorable roles was as the ill-fated housekeeper Elvira Stitt in Robert Aldrich's 1962 horror film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.

 "The Impossible Dream (The Quest)" is a popular song composed by Mitch Leigh, with lyrics written by Joe Darion. The song is the most popular song from the 1965 Broadway musical Man of La Mancha and is also featured in the 1972 film of the same name starring Peter O'Toole and is also featured in the 2021 film Nobody. The complete song is first sung by Don Quixote as he stands vigil over his armor, in response to Aldonza (Dulcinea)'s question about what he means by "following the quest". It is reprised partially three more times – the last by prisoners in a dungeon as Miguel de Cervantes and his manservant mount the drawbridge-like prison staircase to face trial by the Spanish Inquisition. The attraction is almost entirely the talented twisting of Mr. Reed's tongue around familiar patter." In addition to stage and screen adaptations of the novel itself, Sancho Panza is a major character in the play within a play in the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha, and in the film of the same name. In Man of La Mancha, the newly imprisoned Cervantes recruits his fellow prisoners to portray characters from his novel, with Cervantes himself playing Don Quixote and his manservant playing Sancho. Sancho sings the title song as a duet with Quixote, solos "The Missive", "I like him", and "A Little Gossip", plus ensemble numbers "Golden Helmet of Mambrino" and "The Dubbing". Actors who have played Sancho in the play include Irving Jacobson (who also sang on the original cast album), Tony Martinez (1977 and 1992 revivals), and Ernie Sabella (2002 revival).

 "The Impossible Dream (The Quest)" is a popular song composed by Mitch Leigh, with lyrics written by Joe Darion. The song is the most popular song from the 1965 Broadway musical Man of La Mancha and is also featured in the 1972 film of the same name starring Peter O'Toole and is also featured in the 2021 film Nobody. The complete song is first sung by Don Quixote as he stands vigil over his armor, in response to Aldonza (Dulcinea)'s question about what he means by "following the quest". It is reprised partially three more times – the last by prisoners in a dungeon as Miguel de Cervantes and his manservant mount the drawbridge-like prison staircase to face trial by the Spanish Inquisition. The attraction is almost entirely the talented twisting of Mr. Reed's tongue around familiar patter." In addition to stage and screen adaptations of the novel itself, Sancho Panza is a major character in the play within a play in the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha, and in the film of the same name. In Man of La Mancha, the newly imprisoned Cervantes recruits his fellow prisoners to portray characters from his novel, with Cervantes himself playing Don Quixote and his manservant playing Sancho. Sancho sings the title song as a duet with Quixote, solos "The Missive", "I like him", and "A Little Gossip", plus ensemble numbers "Golden Helmet of Mambrino" and "The Dubbing". Actors who have played Sancho in the play include Irving Jacobson (who also sang on the original cast album), Tony Martinez (1977 and 1992 revivals), and Ernie Sabella (2002 revival). James Coco played the character in the 1972 film. ; 1960 Don Quixote, symphony by the Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev ; 1965 Don Quixote, a ballet by George Balanchine, with music by Nicolas Nabokov, dedicated to and starring Suzanne Farrell. ; 1965 Man of La Mancha, a full-length Broadway musical with music by Mitch Leigh, lyrics by Joe Darion and based on Dale Wasserman's non-musical teleplay I, Don Quixote.

In late 1923, Presley married Rena Henderson of Faulkner County. The couple had one child together. From 1928 

 Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Dubbed the "King of Rock and Roll", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording 

 came to mean album sales of 500,000 units. Exact figures from the RIAA are difficult to confirm, but in the press conference from September 22, 1958, originally released on the RCA Victor EP Elvis Sails in 1958 and included on disc four of the RCA CD boxed set The King of Rock 'n' Roll: The Complete 50s Masters, the interviewer asked Presley for a tally of his gold records. Presley responded, "I have 25 million sellers, and two albums that have sold a million each." Most of the songs in the compilation were recorded at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, with other sessions at the RCA Victor studios in New York City, at 20th Century-Fox's Stage One in Hollywood, 

 early 1930, Presley edited songbooks and was in charge of the mailing department for the Hartford Music Company in Hartford, Arkansas. However, he is most closely associated with the Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company, with whom Presley worked for the majority of his professional life spanning from 1930 until his death in 1974. Presley composed hymns for Stamps-Baxter while running a music supply store out of his home in Pangburn, Arkansas. At the time of his death, Presley was working for the Stamps-Baxter Music and Printing Company. It was issued by RCA Records in 1976, and had been issued and charted as The Sun Collection in the UK the previous year. It features liner notes by Roy Carr of the New Musical Express.

 American singer and actor Elvis Presley rose to prominence in the mid-twentieth century, becoming a significant cultural icon due to his contributions to development of rock and roll music. Presley died in 1977 at his mansion, a 13.8-acre estate known as Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee. Paul MacLeod was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1942. He worked in prisons and at automobile assembly plants, but he was unemployed for the majority of his life. He was married twice throughout his life, with both women divorcing him due to his fixation on Presley. In the United States, Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis topped Cashboxs Country album chart, reached number 2 on Billboards Country chart, and reached the top 40 of the Top LPs & Tape listings (now known as the Billboard 200).

A study published in 2005 by the World Health Organization estimates that there may eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Industry, UN and DOE agencies claim low 

 Evidence can be seen from the 1986 Chernobyl event. Due to the violent nature of accident in Chernobyl, a sizable portion of radioactive contamination resulted from the atmosphere were particles that where dispersed during the explosion. Many of these contaminates settled in groundwater systems in immediate surrounding areas, but also Russia and Belarus. Due to the resulting radiation in groundwater, the ecological effects of the disaster can be seen in various aspects down the environmental process line. Radionuclides carried by groundwater systems in and around the areas of Chernobyl have resulted in the uptake to plants in the region and up the food chains into animals, and eventually, humans – as one of the largest 

 of flooding. Many citizens in the surrounding areas have been deemed at risk of exposure to radiation due to the Chernobyl Reactor's proximity to floodplains. A study conducted in 1996 was conducted to see how far the radioactive effects were felt across eastern Europe. Lake Kojanovskoe in Russia, 250 km from the Chernobyl accident site, was found to be one of the most impacted lakes traced from the disaster area. Further investigation found that the water source feeding the lake provided drinking water for approximately 9 million Ukrainians, as well as provided agricultural irrigation and food for 

  A nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as "an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility. Examples include lethal effects to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, reactor core melt." The prime example of a "major nuclear accident" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. The impact of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate since the first nuclear reactors were constructed in 1954 and has

The Chernobyl disaster, considered the worst nuclear disaster in history, occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, now in Ukraine. There is consensus that a total of approximately 30 people died from immediate blast trauma and acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the seconds to months after the disaster, respectively, with 60 in total in the decades since, inclusive of later radiation induced cancer. However, there is considerable debate concerning the accurate number of projected deaths that have yet to have occurred due to the disaster's long-term health effects; long-term death estimates range from up to 4,000 (per the 2005 and 2006 conclusions of a joint consortium of the United Nations) for the most exposed people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, to 16,000 cases in total for all those exposed on the entire continent of Europe, with figures as high as 60,000 when including the relatively minor effects around the globe. This no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Note also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. Differing direct, short-term death toll counts Initially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor.

2024-06-14 14:53:55 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:  The worst nuclear accident to date was the Chernobyl disaster which occurred in 1986 in Ukraine. A study published in 2005 by the World Health Organization estimates that there may eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Other studies have estimated as many as over a million eventual cancer deaths from Chernobyl. Industry, UN and DOE agencies claim low 

 Evidence can be seen from the 1986 Chernobyl event. Due to the violent nature of accident in Chernobyl, a sizable portion of radioactive contamination resulted from the atmosphere were particles that where dispersed during the explosion. Many of these contaminates settled in groundwater systems in immediate surrounding areas, but also Russia and Belarus. Due to the resulting radiation in groundwater, the ecological effects of the disaster can be seen in various aspects down the environmental process line. Radionuclides carried by groundwater systems in and around the areas of Chernobyl have resulted in the uptake to plants in the region and up the food chains into animals, and eventually, humans – as one of the largest 

 of flooding. Many citizens in the surrounding areas have been deemed at risk of exposure to radiation due to the Chernobyl Reactor's proximity to floodplains. A study conducted in 1996 was conducted to see how far the radioactive effects were felt across eastern Europe. Lake Kojanovskoe in Russia, 250 km from the Chernobyl accident site, was found to be one of the most impacted lakes traced from the disaster area. Further investigation found that the water source feeding the lake provided drinking water for approximately 9 million Ukrainians, as well as provided agricultural irrigation and food for 

  A nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as "an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility. Examples include lethal effects to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, reactor core melt." The prime example of a "major nuclear accident" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011. The impact of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate since the first nuclear reactors were constructed in 1954 and has

In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative.

On a 2007 fact-finding trip to Nepal and India, the team realised their design would have to take into account the infrastructural challenges in developing countries, including unreliable power and limited skills of healthcare staff.

In Brazil and Portugal, foundling wheels (roda dos expostos/enjeitados, literally "wheel for exposed/rejected ones") were also used after Queen Maria I proclaimed on May 24, 1783, that all towns should have a foundling hospital. This was taken out of use on June 5, 1949, declared incompatible with the modern social system after five years' debate. A Brazilian film on this subject, Roda

It closed after only five years in 1714 as the number of babies left there was too high for the orphanage to cope with financially. In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris. Foundling wheels were 

 A baby hatch or baby box is a place where people (typically mothers) can bring babies, usually newborn, and abandon them anonymously in a safe place to be found and cared for. This kind of arrangement was common in the Middle Ages and in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the device was known as a foundling wheel. Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century, but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany, where there are around 100 hatches, Czech Republic (76), Poland (67), and in Pakistan where there are more than 300 as of 2006.

In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative. The moment a baby is placed in the "baby bin" care workers on duty receive an electronic signal alerting them. The baby is taken in and the anonymity of the "donor" ensured. Baby M was the first baby that came through the "baby bin", arriving 

"Hu (Boulter) Armach, Primate of All-Ireland, being in the chair, ordered that a turning-wheel, or convenience for taking in children, be provided near the gate of the workhouse; that at any time, by day or by night, a child may be layd in it, to be taken in by the officers of the said house." Baby hatches have existed in one form or another for centuries. From 1198 the first foundling wheels (ruota dei trovatelli) were used in Italy; Pope Innocent III decreed that these should be installed in homes for foundlings so that 

 Embrace was founded in 2008 by Jane Chen, Linus Liang, Naganand Murty and Rahul Panicker. The four founders met as graduate students at Stanford University in a Design for Extreme Affordability course, where they were challenged to design an infant incubator that would cost 1% the price of traditional incubators (about $20,000 in the US). On a 2007 fact-finding trip to Nepal and India, the team realised their design would have to take into account the infrastructural challenges in developing countries, including unreliable power and limited skills of healthcare staff. An initial prototype was developed resembling a baby sleeping bag with a removable, heatable 

 in France, women are allowed to give birth anonymously in hospitals (accouchement sous X) and leave their baby there. In Brazil and Portugal, foundling wheels (roda dos expostos/enjeitados, literally "wheel for exposed/rejected ones") were also used after Queen Maria I proclaimed on May 24, 1783, that all towns should have a foundling hospital. This was taken out of use on June 5, 1949, declared incompatible with the modern social system after five years' debate. A Brazilian film on this subject, Roda 

 In 1989 Zhenghuan Song designed a children’s rocking chair and founded Goodbaby International. In Hamburg, Germany, a Dutch merchant set up a wheel (Drehladen) in an orphanage in 1709. It closed after only five years in 1714 as the number of babies left there was too high for the orphanage to cope with financially. In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris. Foundling wheels were 

 A baby hatch or baby box is a place where people (typically mothers) can bring babies, usually newborn, and abandon them anonymously in a safe place to be found and cared for. This kind of arrangement was common in the Middle Ages and in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the device was known as a foundling wheel. Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century, but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany, where there are around 100 hatches, Czech Republic (76), Poland (67), and in Pakistan where there are more than 300 as of 2006. The hatch is known in German-speaking countries as a Babyklappe (baby hatch or flap), Babyfenster (baby window) or Babywiege (baby cradle); in Italian as Culla per la vita

On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier with a jump of 18.16 m (59 feet 7 inches). During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards observed that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if "he could jump as far as he needed to". During 1996 Edwards went into the 1996 Summer 

 as favourite and world record holder, but it was American Kenny Harrison who took the gold with a jump of 18.09 m. Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and was appointed a CBE shortly thereafter. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the "four majors" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games and European Championships). Jonathan David Edwards, (born 10 May 1966) is a British former triple jumper. In 2011 he was elected President of the Wenlock Olympian Society following the death of its then President, Roy Rogers. These are the results of the Men's triple jump event at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In the first round, Walter Davis took the lead with a 17.20m. Now 35 years old, world record holder and 1995 champion Jonathan Edwards lurked in second place with a 16.84m. Early in the second round Yoel Garcia moved into the lead with a 17.40m. Christian Olsson moved into second with a 17.28m. With his next jump, Olsson took the lead with a 17.47m. The next jumper on the runway was Edwards. This jump is notable for the fact that it is the longest jump ever with a negative wind reading (the athlete with the next best is Jonathan Edwards with 17.79 meters). The jump ranks Harrison as the third best triple jumper in history, behind Jonathan Edwards (18.29WR) and Christian Taylor (18.21). Devetzi was born in Alexandroupoli. Triple Jump – 18.29 m (WR), 18.43 m ( +2.4 m) (not ratified due to excessive wind conditions) ; 100 m – 10.48 s ; Long jump – 7.41 m 

 The men's triple jump event at the 1932 Olympic Games took place August 4. It was Japan's second consecutive gold medal in the men's triple jump; Japan also became the third nation (after the United States and Sweden) to have two medalists in the event in the same Games as Kenkichi Oshima took bronze. He then finished one centimetre behind a medal in the long jump at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He competed at the 2013 European Athletics Indoor Championships on home soil in Gothenburg, jumping a new national record of 8.27 metres in the first round, before jumping 8.29 metres in the final round, only two centimetres behind winner Aleksandr Menkov.

 John Holland Cazale (August 12, 1935 – March 13, 1978)  was an American actor. He appeared in five films over seven years, all of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture: The Godfather (1972), The Conversation (1974), The Godfather Part II (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), and The Deer Hunter (1978), with the two Godfather films and The Deer Hunter winning. As an actor, Strasberg is probably best known for his supporting role as gangster Hyman Roth alongside his former student Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II (1974), a role he took at Pacino's suggestion after Kazan turned down the role, and which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was based on Mark Handley's play Idioglossia, which interested Foster for its theme of "otherness", and because she "loved this idea of a woman who defies categorization, a creature who is labeled and categorized by people based on their own problems and their own prejudices and what they bring to the table." Despite mixed reviews, it was a commercial success, and earned Foster a Screen Actors Guild Award and nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe 

 The film was based on a story by Leonard Praskin and Barney Slater. They took it to Arthur Lubin who liked it and showed the story to producer Leonard Goldstein at Universal. Joan Evans was borrowed from Sam Goldwyn, who had borrowed Peggy Dow from Universal for I Want You the previous year. The filmmakers had to negotiate with the Treasury Department who had strict rules on the creation of fake money. The film was a commercial and critical success, winning the first Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject.

The film's screenwriter Frank Pierson said "the film had been cast with many of the actors that Al Pacino had worked with in New York, including John Cazale, who was a close friend and collaborator in The Godfather." and Beatty was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, and received the award for New Star of the Year – Actor. The film was also nominated for two Oscars, winning one. Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan "was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn." Beatty, years later during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, told the audience that Kazan "had given him the most important break in his career."

The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United States President Barack Obama for his "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples". The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a "new climate" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. The Nobel Committee's decision drew mixed reactions from US commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum, as well as from the rest of the world. Obama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a "just war" saying, "perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars."

She also took a silver medal indoors in the 3000 m walk at the 1978 Nordic Indoor Race Walking Championships, with Simu again topping the podium. Gylder was the dominant female walker nationally during her career, taking six consecutive 5000 metres race walk titles from 1975 to 1980 and seven straight titles in the 10 kilometres race walk discipline. Her victories followed on from those of her sister, Gerd Gylder, who was also an international walker for Norway. In 1952 she finished 12th in the 10 km cross-country event at the Winter Olympics in Oslo and competed without reaching the final in 100 metres and 80 metres hurdles at the Summer Olympics. Her personal best times in her athletic Olympic events were 12.2 seconds and 11.8 seconds, respectively. All the cross-country medals were won by Nordic countries, and Finnish skiers won eight of the twelve possible. Lydia Wideman of Finland became the first female Olympic champion in cross-country skiing; her teammates Mirja Hietamies and Siiri Rantanen won silver and bronze respectively. Veikko Hakulinen won the 50-kilometer men's race to begin an Olympic career that would culminate in seven medals, three of them gold.

The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example. San Francisco is in the Pacific Time zone, and Richmond is in the Eastern Time zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the Sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone. But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California. The territory of Nunavut comprises three time zones: Mountain Time in the west, Central Time in the centre and Eastern Time in the east. Daylight saving time is observed throughout Nunavut with the exception of Southampton Island, including Coral Harbour, and Eureka—a permanent research station on Ellesmere Island—both of which remain on Eastern Standard Time throughout the year. On February 19, 2007, Nunavut added parts of March and November to its daylight saving period, following the United States' Energy Policy Act of 2005. Although Hawaii is further away from equator than Fiji, and therefore there is a slightly greater variation in the daylight length, Hawaii does not observe DST. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, and Oahu, Kauai and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. Therefore advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June.

Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:54:11 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°). The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example. San Francisco is in the Pacific Time zone, and Richmond is in the Eastern Time zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the Sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone. But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California. The territory of Nunavut comprises three time zones: Mountain Time in the west, Central Time in the centre and Eastern Time in the east. Daylight saving time is observed throughout Nunavut with the exception of Southampton Island, including Coral Harbour, and Eureka—a permanent research station on Ellesmere Island—both of which remain on Eastern Standard Time throughout the year. On February 19, 2007, Nunavut added parts of March and November to its daylight saving period, following the United States' Energy Policy Act of 2005. Although Hawaii is further away from equator than Fiji, and therefore there is a slightly greater variation in the daylight length, Hawaii does not observe DST. Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone, and Oahu, Kauai and Niihau are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's meridian and should, theoretically, be located in the next time zone to the west. Therefore advancing the clock in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00 a.m. even in June.

 El Salam Canal (ترعة السلام) is a canal built as a part of the Sinai Project. It then moves east under the Suez Canal in four tunnels. It continues on the other side of the Suez Canal as the El-Sheikh Jaber canal. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from much of Asia by the Red Sea, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km wide. For geopolitical purposes, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka 

  The Suez Canal, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the sea journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and

In 2011, archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt excavating a dried-up lagoon known as Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. In 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King Cheops on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of Suez). Piracy in the Strait of Malacca has long been a threat to ship owners and the mariners who ply the 900 km-long (550 miles) sea lane. It was and still is an important passageway between China and India, used heavily for commercial trade. The strait is on the route between Europe, the Suez Canal, the oil-exporting countries of the Persian Gulf, and the busy ports of East Asia. Navigation was known in Sumer between the 4th and the 3rd millennium BCE. This route would later become known as the Maritime Silk Road, although that is a misnomer, since

 El Salam Canal (ترعة السلام) is a canal built as a part of the Sinai Project. It then moves east under the Suez Canal in four tunnels. It continues on the other side of the Suez Canal as the El-Sheikh Jaber canal. Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from much of Asia by the Red Sea, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km wide. For geopolitical purposes, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, Ras ben Sakka 

  The Suez Canal, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the sea journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and 

 of Egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course. In 2011, archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt excavating a dried-up lagoon known as Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean. In 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King Cheops on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of Suez). Piracy in the Strait of Malacca has long been a threat to ship owners and the mariners who ply the 900 km-long (550 miles) sea lane. It was and still is an important passageway between China and India, used heavily for commercial trade. The strait is on the route between Europe, the Suez Canal, the oil-exporting countries of the Persian Gulf, and the busy ports of East Asia. Navigation was known in Sumer between the 4th and the 3rd millennium BCE. This route would later become known as the Maritime Silk Road, although that is a misnomer, since

The Xinhai Revolution in 1911 forced the abdication of the last Qing Emperor Puyi and ended China's last imperial dynasty. The revolutionaries, headed by Sun Yat-sen, were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang Qichao, who tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall, Sun Yat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race, and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors.

These dresses – described by fellow royal gown designer Bruce Oldfield as "gorgeous loss leaders" – boosted Arbeid's reputation and won him many other clients, particularly in the US. Other famous wearers of Arbeid gowns included Queen Noor of Jordan, Shirley Bassey and Estée Lauder. Jaden Smith, Frankie Muniz, Demi Lovato, Mindy Kaling, and Justin Bieber agreed that the dress was blue and black, while Anna Kendrick, B. J. Novak, Katy Perry, Julianne Moore, and Sarah Hyland saw it as white and gold. Lucy Hale, Phoebe Tonkin, and Katie Nolan saw different colour schemes at different times. The day after McNeill's post, Roman Originals' website experienced a major surge in traffic; a representative of the retailer stated that "we sold out of the dress in the first 30 minutes of our business day and after restocking it, it's become phenomenal". On 28 February, Roman announced that they would make a single white and gold dress for a Comic Relief charity auction. On 3 March, the Johnstons, Bleasdale, and MacNeill appeared as guests on The Ellen DeGeneres Show

In February 2021, the Myanmar coup d'état removed a number of democratically elected members of parliament from power, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. While the PRC initially downplayed the military coup as "a major cabinet reshuffle", it later expressed concern over the 12-month emergency declared by military leader Min Aung Hlaing, demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's US$1.3 million prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people.

The film was based on the 1949 musical South Pacific by Rodgers and Hammerstein. The composers had much say in this recording, with many of the songs performed by accomplished singers rather than the actors in the film. Mary Martin said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for South Pacific, knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her look her best. She also said that Rodgers and Hammerstein listened to all her suggestions and she worked extremely well with them. Both Rodgers and Hammerstein wanted Doris Day for the lead in the film version of South Pacific and she reportedly wanted the part. They discussed it with her, but after her manager/husband Martin Melcher would not budge on his demand for a high salary for her, the role went to Mitzi Gaynor. The script is based on Bell's 1918 play A Dislocated Honeymoon. It toured through several cities and ended in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it closed on April 16, 1921.

Soon Carmen enters and steals Tom's affections. It was first introduced by Mary Martin in the original Broadway production and sung by Mitzi Gaynor in the 1958 film adaptation.

The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.5 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62800 km. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface and about 29% of its water surface area. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica). Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office. South America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of Earth's surface. As of 2018, its population is more than 430 million, according to estimates of population in The World Factbook.

Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate. Europe is a landmass variously recognised as part of Eurasia or a continent in its own right, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa, and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east.

It agreed to create a single currency, although without the participation of the United Kingdom, by January 1999. Germany was cautious about giving up its stable currency, i.e., the German Mark, France approved the treaty by a narrow margin and Denmark refused to ratify until they got such an opt-out from monetary union as the United Kingdom, an opt-out that they maintain as of 2019. The Single European Act was signed by the foreign ministers on 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and The Hague respectively. In a single document it dealt with reform of institutions, extension of powers, foreign policy cooperation and the single market. The act was influenced by work on what would be the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty establishing the European Union. The Merger Treaty was signed on 8 April 1965 and entered into force on 1 July 1967 merging all three Communities with common institutions. In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. After tough negotiations, the Maastricht Treaty entered into force in 1993 with the goal of creating an economic and monetary union by 1999 for all EU states except the UK and Denmark (even though Denmark has a fixed exchange rate policy with the euro). In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty finalised its political authority, the Eurogroup, alongside the European Central Bank. Following the delays in the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which led to the Danish opt-outs, the treaty came into force on 1 November 1993 under the third Delors Commission. The new European Union introduced the pillar system, formalising European Political Cooperation as the Common Foreign and Security Policy and adding the new area of Justice and Home Affairs. Furthermore, on 25 May, the European Investment Fund was established by the EIB and the European Police Office was created on 26 July 1995 with the signing of the Europol convention. (See also: Crocodile Club) Similar proposals from the Commission collapsed due to arguments over the UK rebate (secured by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984) and a German-Italian proposal resulted in the Solemn Declaration on European Union of 19 June 1983 as a political impetus towards a Union but not itself a binding treaty. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is one of two treaties forming the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU), the other being the Treaty on European Union (TEU; also referred to as the Treaty of Maastricht). The Treaty originated as the Treaty of Rome (fully the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community), which brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and 

 from the Pan-European Picnic in 1989. Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,: Following the end of the Cold War, the European Economic Community pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries.

Also included are Parton's covers of the Mac Davis-penned Elvis Presley hit "In the Ghetto" and Joe South's "Games People Play". In a CMT interview with Patty Loveless, Parton confirmed that the man on the album cover is her reclusive husband, Carl Dean. It was produced by Arthur Freed and directed by Norman Z. McLeod. The cast featured Red Skelton as Red, Ann Sothern as Hattie Maloney, Rags Ragland as Rags, Ben Blue as Rowdy, Marsha Hunt as Leila Tree, Virginia O'Brien as Flo Foster, Alan Mowbray as Jay Jerkins, Dan Dailey as Dick Bulliard and Lena Horne as Singer in Phil's Place. Songs used in the film are as follows:

1) "Let the River Run" – Carly Simon ; 2) "In Love" (Instrumental) – Carly Simon ; 3) "The Man That Got Away" (Instrumental) – Rob Mounsey, George Young, Chip Jackson, Grady Tate ; 4) "The Scar" (Instrumental) – Carly Simon ; 5) "Let the River Run" – The St. Thomas Choir Of Men And Boys ; 6) "Lady In Red" – Chris De Burgh ; 7) "Carlotta's Heart" – Carly Simon ; 8) "Looking Through Katherine's House" – Carly Simon ; 9) "Poor Butterfly" (Instrumental) – Sonny Rollins ; 10) "I'm So Excited" – Pointer Sisters The film's main theme "Let the River Run" was written and performed by American singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and won her an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Grammy Award for Best Song. The credits for the film read "music by Carly Simon, scored by Rob Mounsey". In the film, New Zealand recording artist Sharon O'Neill performs the song.

The song reached both the country and pop charts in 1968; and to this day, "Harper Valley PTA" remains the most 

 Riley, who was working as a secretary in Nashville for Jerry Chesnut, got to hear the song and recorded it herself and it became a massive hit for her. Riley's version won her a Grammy for the Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. The song later inspired an eponymous 1978 motion picture and short-lived 1981 television series, both starring Barbara Eden playing the heroine of the story, Mrs. Johnson, who now had a first name, Stella. It is an adaptation of the 1954 novel God and My Country by MacKinlay Kantor and was the final live action film produced by Walt Disney, who died two weeks later. The film stars Fred MacMurray, Vera Miles, Lillian Gish, Charles Ruggles and Kurt Russell, and is co-produced by Walt Disney and Winston Hibler, directed by Norman Tokar and written by Louis Pelletier. After the film's production, the Boy Scouts of America considered using the song as their anthem, but efforts toward the end were dropped. The series went on to flesh out the story in the song, as it told of the adventures of Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden), a widowed single mother to teenager Dee (Jenn Thompson), who lived in the fictional town of Harper Valley, Ohio. The town was dominated by the namesakes of the founder, the Harper family, most prominently represented by the mayor, Otis Harper, Jr (George Gobel). Mrs. Johnson's flouting of the small town's conventions, and exposure of the hypocrisy of many of its other notorious residents provided the humour. Her most notable foes were the wealthy and completely snobbish Reilly family, which consisted of the snobby head of the family, Flora (Anne Francine); her snotty daughter, Wanda (Bridget Hanley); her husband, Bobby, (Rod McCary) and their daughter,

Bobby Vinton, backed by arranger/conductor Stan Applebaum, recorded and released the most widely successful version of "There! In 1964, Vinton released the song on the album There! Vinton's version topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart on January 4, 1964 and remained there for four weeks. It was Vinton's third number-one song on both charts, following "Roses Are Red (My Love)" and "Blue Velvet". 1 on New Zealand's "Lever Hit Parade", No. 5 on Canada's CHUM Hit Parade, and spent 10 weeks on the United Kingdom's Record Retailer chart, reaching No. Vinton's version was ranked No. In 1961, a song copyrighted in 1955 by Sovine and co-writer Dale Noe became a sizeable hit on the pop chart. The tune was the ballad "Missing You", arranged in Countrypolitan style and was recorded by Ray Peterson for his own Dunes label. In 1963, Sovine passed on the helping hand given him by older performers when he heard the singing of minor league baseball player Charley Pride and suggested that he move to Nashville, Tennessee. Sovine opened doors for Pride at Pierce's Cedarwood Publishing, but his own career had stalled: "Dream House For Sale", which reached number 22 in 1964, came nearly eight years after his last hit. Upon release, The Albany Herald stated: "Hillman as lead vocalist easily leads the Desert Rose Band through easy-listening music. They commented: "This cut is pure Desert Rose Band with its rootsy vocal harmony, country-pop melody and breezy tempo. The Wall Street Journal described the song as "a surrealist tale about an imagined jilting and the appearance of earthbound angels offering the singer immortality—in exchange for his footwear". Costello explained, "I had the essential image, then I worked backward — a dancehall scene with the put-down lines. One of the most successful versions was recorded by country music artist Elton Britt, whose version reached No. In 1990, another rendition of the song was recorded by Bert Southwood, in cooperation with Playtown Sound Audio Services. It features 13 songs that were sung by Vinton on his half-hour variety show of the same name. The album begins with the show's theme song, an instrumental version of Vinton's huge hit "My Melody of Love"; otherwise the remainder of the tracks are cover versions of popular songs of the 1960s and early 1970s. The song also remained at number one for five weeks on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and for 11 weeks on the Hot R&B Singles chart becoming the longest running number one on the R&B charts at the time; it remained in the top 40 for 24 weeks. The song was number one on the Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, and R&B chart simultaneously for a record-equaling five weeks; Ray Charles' "I Can't Stop Loving You" in 1962 achieved the same feat on the same charts. The song stayed at number one 

 The quoted line, "Heart of My Heart", so longed for in the 1926 song, begins the chorus of "The Story of the Rose", written by Andrew Mack (1863–1931) in 1899. "Cash wrapped up 1967 by releasing a version of the Carter sisters' "Rosanna's Going Wild," a song about a young woman who is out to experience life to the fullest. Written by the Carter sisters, "Rosanna's Going Wild" was Cash's last single of 1967 and hit #2 by February of 1968."

One of the most successful versions was recorded by country music artist Elton Britt, whose version reached No. In 1990, another rendition of the song was recorded by Bert Southwood, in cooperation with Playtown Sound Audio Services. It features 13 songs that were sung by Vinton on his half-hour variety show of the same name. The album begins with the show's theme song, an instrumental version of Vinton's huge hit "My Melody of Love"; otherwise the remainder of the tracks are cover versions of popular songs of the 1960s and early 1970s. The song also remained at number one for five weeks on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and for 11 weeks on the Hot R&B Singles chart becoming the longest running number one on the R&B charts at the time; it remained in the top 40 for 24 weeks. The song was number one on the Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, and R&B chart simultaneously for a record-equaling five weeks; Ray Charles' "I Can't Stop Loving You" in 1962 achieved the same feat on the same charts. The song stayed at number one 

 The quoted line, "Heart of My Heart", so longed for in the 1926 song, begins the chorus of "The Story of the Rose", written by Andrew Mack (1863–1931) in 1899. "Cash wrapped up 1967 by releasing a version of the Carter sisters' "Rosanna's Going Wild," a song about a young woman who is out to experience life to the fullest. Written by the Carter sisters, "Rosanna's Going Wild" was Cash's last single of 1967 and hit #2 by February of 1968." The success was completely unexpected: "During the Christmas holidays preceding the Folsom recording date, Cash's latest single "Rosanna's Going Wild" debuted on Billboard's country music charts.

On 27 May 1942 in Prague, Reinhard Heydrich – the commander of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), acting governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and a principal architect of the Holocaust – was attacked and wounded in an assassination attempt by Czechoslovak resistance operatives Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. Heydrich died of his wounds on 4 June 1942. He was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and an important figure in the rise of Adolf Hitler. The assassination, codenamed Operation Anthropoid, was carried out by soldiers of the Czechoslovak Army after preparation and training by the British Special Operations Executive and with the approval of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, led by Edvard Beneš. The Czechoslovaks undertook the operation to help confer legitimacy on the government-in-exile, and to exact retribution for Heydrich's brutal rule. The operation was the only government-sponsored assassination of a senior Nazi leader during the Second World War. Heydrich's death led to a wave of reprisals by SS troops, including the destruction of villages and mass killings of civilians. In 1938, he assisted in the Anschluss and was given command of the SS and police force in Austria. In January 1943, Kaltenbrunner was appointed chief of the RSHA, succeeding Reinhard Heydrich, who was assassinated in May 1942.

The men's triathlon was an unusual event conducted during the 1904 Summer Olympics. The International Olympic Committee lists it as part of the Athletics at the 1904 Summer Olympics programme, though other sources list it among the Gymnastics at the 1904 Summer Olympics events. Nevertheless, the International Olympic Committee lists the medals won in this event as being part of the sport of Athletics. The United States is the nation that has won the most medals in athletics at the Olympic Games, around 795, of which 332 are gold. In 1900, the United States had no organized team for the 1900 Summer Olympics. On learning that Michigan's rival, the University of Chicago, was sending a delegation of athletes to the games in Paris, Pattengill led a fundraising effort to send some of Michigan's best athletes to the games. The effort raised sufficient funds to send four Michigan athletes and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick to Paris. Michigan's John McLean won a silver medal in the high hurdles. One of the highlights for Michigan athletics during the Pattengill's time as chairman of the Athletic Boards came at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, which have sometimes been referred to as the "Michigan Olympics." The Michigan medal winners were Archie Hahn (gold medals in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters), Ralph Rose (gold medal in the shot put, silver medal in the discus, and bronze medal in the hammer throw), Charles Dvorak (gold medal in the pole vault), Fred Schule (gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles), and William Coe (silver medal in the shot put).

 The book disputes the official view of Lennon as a contented househusband raising his son Sean and baking bread while Yoko ran the family business. Instead, Nowhere Man portrays Lennon's daily life at the Dakota as that of a "tormented superstar, a prisoner of his fame, locked in his bedroom raving about Jesus Christ, while a retinue of servants tended to his every need." The final part of the book, The Coda, focuses on the mental disintegration of Lennon's assassin, Mark David Chapman, and includes Chapter 27, the so-called missing chapter of J.D. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 "in Lennon's blood." John Lennon of the Beatles was murdered as he was returning to home to the Dakota, a famed apartment building in New York City. Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, had stepped out of a limousine and walked toward the building's entrance when Mark David Chapman shot him four times in the back. Lennon was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. By January 1972, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened a file on the Lennons, fearing they would organise the youth vote and prevent a second term for President Richard Nixon. Together with his wife, Yoko Ono, John Lennon spent New Year 1970 in Aalborg, Denmark, establishing a relationship with Ono's former husband, artist Tony Cox, and visiting Cox and Ono's daughter Kyoko. It was also around this time that he and his wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. The Dakota has historically been home to many artists, actors, and musicians, including John Lennon, who was murdered in the archway of the building in 1980. British musician John Lennon, a building resident, was shot dead by Mark David Chapman outside the building on December 8, 1980. After the death of John Lennon, on December 8, 1980, public awareness of The Hit Factory increased; Lennon's final album had been recorded at The Hit Factory at 353 West 48th Street. Mourners and music fans around the world read accounts of the murder in newspapers on the days following the shooting, and The Hit Factory was mentioned in some of these publications. However, there are contradictory reports as to whether he was recording at The Hit Factory or the nearby Record Plant the day he was murdered. Most publications cite the Record Plant as the location. Witnesses present with John Lennon, such as producer Jack Douglas, cite the Record Plant as the studio where he spent his time recording and mixing tracks the evening of the murder. However, Keith Badman, not an eyewitness, in his book The Beatles: After the Break-up, 1970–2000 states that Lennon had been at The Hit Factory the night of his murder. He also references that Lennon had been at the studio the last several days working on and mixing tracks for Yoko Ono.

On 4 July 1908 their next aircraft, the June Bug piloted by Glenn Curtiss, won the Scientific American trophy for the first officially observed one kilometer flight in North America. The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. Previously, the fastest were the troubled, short-lived Russian (Soviet Union) Tupolev Tu-144 SST (Mach 2.35; equal to 806.05 m/s) and the French/British Concorde, with a maximum speed of Mach 2.23 or 686 m/s and a normal cruising speed of Mach 2 or 320.705 m/s. Before them, the Convair 990 Coronado jet airliner of the 1960s flew at over 600 mph. A smaller model of the NC-4 is kept in the Milestones of Flight Gallery in the National Air and Space Museum, a place of honor, along with the original Wright Flyer of 1903; Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis of 1927; Chuck Yeager's Glamorous Glennis X-1 rocket plane of 1947, and an X-15 rocket aircraft. Although assigned to Wright Field, he spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, in California's high desert, testing a wide variety of experimental prototypes such as Douglas' highly unconventional pusher-prop light bomber, the XB-42 Mixmaster. In December 1945, he and Lieutenant Colonel Henry E. Warden set a new transcontinental speed record when they flew this airplane from Long Beach, California, to Bolling Air Force Base, in Washington, D.C., in just five hours, 17 minutes. It was also during this period that he acquired his first experience with a flying wing, as he familiarized himself with the flying qualities of the Northrop N-9M, a single-seat, one-third scale mock-up of the giant XB-35 prototype bomber. The flight was the first Fédération Aéronautique Internationale aviation record to have been won by the Japanese. This flight to Europe made the pilot, Masaaki Iinuma (then 26 years old), a national hero, and he was acclaimed as the “Japanese Lindbergh”. Both the pilot and navigator Kenji Tsukagoshi were awarded the Légion d'honneur by the French government. On April 12, only a few days after the record-breaking flight, the Kamikaze-go carried Prince Chichibu and Princess Chichibu, who were visiting England for the coronation, on a joy ride.

Her younger sister, Lea (May) is hired on the recommendation of Christine.

It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Anna Fitzgerald's older sister, Kate, suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better.

 Tarzan, a fictional character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, first appeared in the 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes, and then in twenty-four sequels by Burroughs and numerous more by other authors. Tarzan the Ape Man is a 1932 pre-Code American action adventure film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer featuring Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous jungle hero Tarzan and starring Johnny Weissmuller, Neil Hamilton, C.

It is also the first appearance of Tarzan’s famous yell. Places and people from the original Tarzan novels are referred to, suggesting that Tarzan does or did exist in that universe. In a 1999 The Phantom story, Lord of the Jungle, the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan. Warren Ellis' Planetary series has a pastiche of Tarzan named Lord Blackstock.

 The character of Muviro emerges gradually in the novels. The first actual reference to him may occur in The Son of Tarzan, the fourth book, in which a "Muviri" appears as a minor character, stated to be a follower of Tarzan who had known him in "the old days."

He is the author of Tarzan: The Centennial Celebration, the "only official commemorative illustrated history" of Burroughs' literary character Tarzan, which book was a 2013 Locus Award finalist for Best Art Book.

The firm manufactures and sells automobiles in Canada, and also in the United States and other countries around the world. It eventually established and managed the following subsidiaries:  The Model C, the first car to be produced in Canada, rolled out of the factory in late September 1904. an assembly plant was constructed in a rented warehouse in the Westhafen (western port) district of Berlin, which was well located for receiving deliveries of kits and components via the country's canal network. The Berlin assembly operation produced 1,177 Model Ts in 1926 and a further 2,594 during 1927 which was the Model T's final year: in August 1927 Model T production in Berlin ended, and it was nearly a year before, on 20 August 1928, Ford auto-production in Berlin recommenced, now of the Ford Model A. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years' production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927). But the engine continued to be produced and sold to various consumer, industrial, military, and marine markets throughout the world until 1941. Although Ford .. was a pacifist, he was .. happy to supply the US Army with more than 12,000 of these vehicles,.." and: "There was no civilian production of the Model Ts between 1917 and 1918." Below are the numbers of Model T trucks produced each year, not including Canadian production. The Ford Motor Company of Canada, founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada.

The firm manufactures and sells automobiles in Canada, and also in the United States and other countries around the world. It eventually established and managed the following subsidiaries:  The Model C, the first car to be produced in Canada, rolled out of the factory in late September 1904. an assembly plant was constructed in a rented warehouse in the Westhafen (western port) district of Berlin, which was well located for receiving deliveries of kits and components via the country's canal network. The Berlin assembly operation produced 1,177 Model Ts in 1926 and a further 2,594 during 1927 which was the Model T's final year: in August 1927 Model T production in Berlin ended, and it was nearly a year before, on 20 August 1928, Ford auto-production in Berlin recommenced, now of the Ford Model A. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years' production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927). But the engine continued to be produced and sold to various consumer, industrial, military, and marine markets throughout the world until 1941. Although Ford .. was a pacifist, he was .. happy to supply the US Army with more than 12,000 of these vehicles,.." and: "There was no civilian production of the Model Ts between 1917 and 1918."

 The Trans–Siberian Railway (TSR; ) is a network of railways connecting Western Russia to the Russian Far East. It is the longest railway line in the world, with a length of over 9,289 km, from the capital Moscow, the largest city in Europe, to Vladivostok, which is next to the Sea of Japan. The Trans-Siberian Railway has directly connected Moscow with Vladivostok since 1916. Expansion of the railway system continues, with connecting rails going into Asia, namely Mongolia, China and North Korea. There are also plans to connect Tokyo, the capital of Japan, to the railway via bridges between the mainland and the islands of Sakhalin and Hokkaido. The line is single-track, excepting the double-track section from Tynda to Bestuzhevo, which shared with the Baikal–Amur Mainline (BAM). The line currently has an official length of 1,213 km, branching from the Trans-Siberian railway at Bamovskaya station, near Skovorodino in Amur Oblast. The construction of this railway favoured the development of the gold mining industry, logging, fisheries and the fur trade in Siberia and Russian Far East. The city is also served by the Irkutsk International Airport and the smaller Irkutsk Northwest Airport. With a length of 2100 km, it is the longest segment, from Chita to Khabarovsk, connecting the paved roads of Siberia with those of the Russian Far East. Before completion of the road, the Russian Pacific coast was connected to the rest of the country only by airlines, the Trans-Siberian Railway, and the Baikal–Amur Mainline. Its mainline is a link in the Trans-Siberian Railway crossing the Krasnoyarsk Krai and Khakassia. It is wedged between the West Siberian Railway (to the west) and East Siberian Railway (to the east).

By the middle of the 16th century, Aleppo had displaced Damascus as the principal market for goods coming to the Mediterranean region from the east. Aleppo served as the company's headquarters until the late 18th century. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. The economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.

2024-06-14 14:54:33 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Thanks to its strategic geographic location on the trade route between Anatolia and the east, Aleppo rose to high prominence in the Ottoman era, at one point being second only to Constantinople in the empire. By the middle of the 16th century, Aleppo had displaced Damascus as the principal market for goods coming to the Mediterranean region from the east. Aleppo served as the company's headquarters until the late 18th century. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans.

In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language). For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007. People born in Lilkovo speak a Rhodopean dialect of Bulgarian, which is similar to the one spoken in Smolyan. A few examples are shown in the table below:

 Balkan dialects, also known as Balkan I, are spoken in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Iran, North Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine. Bugurdži, Drindari and Kalajdži Romani are spoken in North Macedonia, Kosovo, Serbia and in northern and central Bulgaria. Elšík uses this classification and dialect examples (geographical information from Matras ):

 Balkan Romani has traditionally been an oral language, but recently, there is a growing amount of effort to decode and standardize the language. Pomaks (Помаци; Πομάκοι; Pomaklar) are Bulgarian-speaking Muslims inhabiting Bulgaria, northeastern Greece and mainly northwestern Turkey. The c. 220,000 strong ethno-confessional minority in Bulgaria is known officially as Bulgarian Muslims. The term has also been used as a wider designation, including also the Slavic Muslim populations of North Macedonia and Albania. They speak various Bulgarian dialects and those spoken in Greece and Turkey are referred to there as the Pomak language. The term is widely used colloquially for Eastern South Slavic Muslims, considered derogatory. However, in Greece and Turkey the practice for declaring the ethnic group at census has been abolished for decades. Different members of the group today declare a variety of ethnic identities: Bulgarian, Pomak,   ethnic Muslims, Turkish and other.

Located in the Central Administrative Okrug, it is one of three Catholic churches in Moscow and the largest in Russia. The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. The style was influenced by Westminster Abbey and Milan 

  The cathedral, built in a neo-Gothic style, is a cruciform pseudo-basilica with three naves and an apse. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. The church is an example of red-brick Eclecticism. It has the elements of ancient architecture, and of modernism (in particular, large semicircular window openings of the refectory). The building has a cruciform appearance, five onion domes covered with tent are strictly proportional. It belongs to the Diocese of Rostov and Novocherkassk. Erected in the early 20th century, it is considered to be an object of Russian cultural heritage. The portal symbolises Heaven's gate, reached by obeying the Commandments and the teachings of Jesus. The present cross-in-square structure was completed between 1010 and 1029 by the medieval Georgian architect Arsukisdze, although the site itself dates back to the early fourth century. In the nave, under the windows, are fourteen reliefs depicting the Stations of the Cross. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well 

 Red Square is one of the oldest and largest squares in Moscow, the capital of Russia.

 Katherine Brandon (née Willoughby), Duchess of Suffolk, suo jure 12th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby (22 March 1519 – 19 September 1580), was an English noblewoman living at the courts of King Henry VIII, King Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I. She was the fourth wife of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who acted as her legal guardian during his third marriage to Henry VIII's sister Mary. Her second husband was Richard Bertie, a member of her household. Following Charles Brandon's death in 1545, it was rumoured that King Henry had considered marrying Katherine as his seventh wife, while he was still married to his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, who was Katherine's close friend. Soon after her return, Mary was married to William Carey, a wealthy and influential courtier, on 4 February 1520; Henry VIII was a guest at the couple's wedding. At some point, Mary became Henry's mistress; the starting date and duration of the liaison are unknown. It was rumoured that one or both of Mary's children were fathered by the King. Henry VIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, had first been married to Henry's elder brother Arthur when he was a little over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died just a few months later. Henry later used this to justify the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress. In 1287 or 1288, when Katherine was 15 or 16 years old, she married Baron Nicholas de Audley and had two sons and a daughter, the first when she was 17 years old. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl's death.

Seeing an opportunity for a major battle, Napoleon ordered four more army corps to march to the battlefield. He detailed Murat to delay his attack in order to wait for reinforcements and, as soon as these reached the battlefield, attack the Russians frontally using Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond 

 Napoleon was retreating from his failed invasion of Russia in 1812. Even though the French were victorious in the initial battles during their campaign in Germany, the Coalition armies eventually joined together and defeated them at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813. After the battle, the Pro-French German Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby loosening Napoleon's hold on Germany east of the Rhine. The Coalition forces in Germany then crossed the Rhine and invaded France. The battle saw a bold maneuver by Napoleon Bonaparte's French Army of Italy to outflank the Austrian army led by József Alvinczi and cut off its line of retreat. While the Austrians prevaricated, Steinmetz decided at 8:30 am to send eight infantry 

 The French suffered 1,000 killed and wounded, plus 800 men and two artillery pieces captured. Having failed to dislodge the Austrians, Bonaparte contemplated a retreat behind the Adda River and potentially abandoning the blockade of Mantua. But when the Austrians dawdled rather than taking advantage of their opportunities, the French commander determined to attack his opponent again.

 The Battle of Montenotte was fought on 12 April 1796, during the French Revolutionary Wars, between the French army under General Napoleon Bonaparte and an Austrian corps under Count Eugène-Guillaume Argenteau. By the morning of the 12th, Bonaparte concentrated large forces against Argenteau's now-outnumbered troops. The strongest French push came from the direction of the mountaintop redoubt, but a second force fell on the weak Austrian right flank and overwhelmed it. This attack against the boundary between the Austrian and Sardinian armies threatened to sever the link between the two allies. A brief period of peace followed the March 1802 Treaty of Amiens before British-French relations deteriorated, leading to the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803. In August 1805, the 200,000-strong French Grande Armée invaded the German states, hoping to defeat Austria before Russian forces could intervene. The Austrian capital, Vienna, was captured in November and a Russo-Austrian army was decisively defeated at the 2 December Battle of Austerlitz. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim.

Henry Watson Fowler suggests that the American terms "plurality" and "majority" offer single-word alternatives for the corresponding two-word terms in British English, "relative majority" and "absolute majority", and that in British English "majority" is sometimes understood to mean "receiving the most votes" and can therefore be confused with "plurality". William Poundstone observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the spoiler effect—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority. Plurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations. That makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials. (However, the drawing of district boundary lines can be very contentious in the plurality system.) In a system based on multi-seat districts, it elects multiple candidates in a district and may be referred to as winner-takes-all, bloc voting or plurality block voting. It is used in most 

 Candidates are elected using limited instant-runoff voting where the voter has to rank 3 candidates, known locally as Limited preferential voting. Voters rank candidates in order of preference, and their votes are initially allocated to their first-choice candidate. If, after this initial count, no candidate has a majority of votes cast, a mathematical formula comes into play. The random ballot, single stochastic vote, or lottery voting is an electoral system in which an election is decided on the basis of a single randomly selected ballot. It is closely related to random dictatorship;  the latter is a general rule for social choice, while random ballot is an application of this general rule for electing candidates in multi-constituency bodies. Whilst appearing superficially chaotic, the system has the potential to retain the most attractive characteristics of both first past the post and proportional representation systems in elections to multi-constituency bodies. Its application to elections was first described in 1984 by Akhil Reed Amar,. in the United States, the lower house (Lok Sabha) in India, elections to the British House of Commons and English local elections in the United Kingdom, France (run-off election) and federal and provincial elections in Canada (although prior to 1956 three provinces used ranked voting in provincial elections). Plurality voting is distinguished from a majoritarian electoral system in which a winning candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes: more votes than all other candidates combined. Under plurality voting, the leading candidate, whether or not he or she has a majority of votes, is elected. Both plurality and majoritarian systems may use single-member or multi-member constituencies.

Other early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary, William Murdoch, had developed plans 

 Symington quickly saw a way to marry the efficiency of the Watt engine with the simplicity of that devised by Thomas Newcomen. Encouraged by Gilbert Meason, Symington demonstrated the practicality of his idea and his improved atmospheric engine was patented in 1787. When Watt sent someone to make a sketch of how this new engine worked, he discovered that the steam was condensed under a second piston and this was then pushed down when fresh steam entered the cylinder, forcing out the condensate. It was developed in 18th-century Britain by Richard Arkwright and John Kay (a clockmaker). Atherton was approached in January 1768 by John Kay and Richard Arkwright (who at the time was an entrepreneur) for both financial, and technical assistance in creating a model of a spinning machine. A working model was successfully produced and was patented in 1769 by Richard Arkwright. Some experiments with high-pressure steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably Trevithick's Puffing Devil, in 1801, and his later London Steam Carriage of 1803, which circumvented Watt's condenser patent by simply removing it. Watt, for example, wanted to have Trevithick imprisoned because of the danger his high-pressure engines introduced. Evans ignored the potential drawbacks, 

 Atherton was a successful instrument and engine maker, who also designed and manufactured innovative machinery for the textile machinery during the eighteenth century. However, the first successful designs have been attributed to Atherton; a Warrington machine builder who helped Sir Richard Arkwright whilst in his late twenties.

 Matthew Boulton (3 September 172817 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt. In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment. Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. After three years, Bloodworth and Stafford were paid off, and Samuel Need – a hosier of Nottingham – joined the partnership. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban mill towns, like Manchester, which with neighbouring Salford had more than 50 mills by 1802. The mill owners bought a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1810 and a few years later purchased another because the river's water level was low in summer and could interrupt production of cloth during some years.

By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. After three years, Bloodworth and Stafford were paid off, and Samuel Need – a hosier of Nottingham – joined the partnership. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban mill towns, like Manchester, which with neighbouring Salford had more than 50 mills by 1802. The mill owners bought a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1810 and a few years later purchased another because the river's water level was low in summer and could interrupt production of cloth during some years.

Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal. Ash is the waste product of coal that has been used to boil water. When coal is burned into fly ash the uranium and thorium in the unburned coal are concentrated at up to 10 times their original levels. Essentially, brown coal is sheared and attritioned reducing the mean particle size and releasing water naturally held in the porous coal microstructure forming a plastic mass.

The Western Coalfield has been hit much harder by acid rain regulations. Whereas about half of Eastern coal is high in sulfur content, nearly all Western coal falls into this category. There are two types of coal found in Pennsylvania: anthracite (the “hard coal” found in Northeastern Pennsylvania below the Allegheny Ridge southwest to Harrisburg; also called “stone coal”, “rock coal” in the 1800s) and bituminous (“soft coal”, found west of the Allegheny Front escarpment). Anthracite coal is a natural mineral with a high carbon and energy content that gives off light and heat (produced energy) when burned, making it useful as a fuel.

A relatively high altitude formation, Maddingley brown coal is distinguished as having 60 per cent moisture content and a rich fulvic acid and humic acid content. The classification is sub-bituminous, which makes the coal similar to that found in Alberta and the Powder River Basin. The Coldry Process is applied to brown coal (lignite) with a typical moisture content of 60 per cent by weight and transforms the coal into a densified coal product of equal or better calorific value (5,800 kcal/kg) to typical export quality black coal, with less ash and sulfur content. Black coal equivalent derived from brown coal is ostensibly a 'cleaner' burning coal fuel than most black coals. To solve the problem of energy shortage after the deforestation in the area, Rhenanus experimented with brown coal beginning in 1563, which was discovered a few years earlier in the area of the nearby mountain "Hoher Meissner".

Their cell walls are made of chitin, a cholesterol-lowering dietary fiber. The common white mushroom was first cultivated by the French more than 300 years ago in abandoned gypsum quarries near Paris, but only recently has it become possible to cultivate a number of other species on a commercial scale. Truffles grow underground among the roots of certain oak, hazel, and linden trees.

 Burgundy truffles (truffe de Bourgogne; tartufo nero di Fragno or scorzone, "bark"; trufa de verano; svart sommartryffel), have a hazelnut-like aroma and are prized for their gastronomic qualities. They are used in the haute cuisine of France and Italy, sometimes as a less expensive, milder substitute for the Périgord black truffle (T. melanosporum) when the latter are not available.

• | Mushrooms contain a high concentration of glutamic acid—the naturally occurring form of monosodium glutamate (MSG). **Mushrooms and truffles are fungi,** primitive plants that draw their nutrients from the partially decomposed tissues of more complex vegetation, such as trees. Their cell walls are made of chitin, a cholesterol-lowering dietary fiber. The common white mushroom was first cultivated by the French more than 300 years ago in abandoned gypsum quarries near Paris, but only recently has it become possible to cultivate a number of other species on a commercial scale. Truffles grow underground among the roots of certain oak, hazel, and linden trees. As a result of overharvesting and deforestation, truffles are now so rare and expensive that only minute shavings are used to flavor dishes. Attempts to grow them on a commercial scale have been unsuccessful so far. ; Edible mushroom ; List of mushroom dishes

In the primary (growing) plant cell wall, the major carbohydrates are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is xyloglucan. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units. It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules. Figure 19–63 Scale model of a portion of a primary plant cell wall showing the two major polysaccharide networks. the network of cellulose and cross-linking glycans provides tensile strength, while the pectin network resists compression. Cellulose, cross-linking glycans, and pectin are typically present in roughly equal amounts in a primary cell wall. the middle lamella is especially rich in pectin, and it cements adjacent cells together. Once a plant cell has left the meristem where it is generated, it can grow dramatically, commonly by more than a thousand times in volume. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both.Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils that they deposit in the wall (Figure 19–64). The primary cell wall of plants is composed of cellulose microfibrils interwoven with a network of pectic polysaccharides. Cellulose plays a critical role in providing tensile strength to the primary cell wall, which contributes to the overall strength and resilience of plant cells. The primary cell wall enables plant cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the internal hydrostatic pressure that pushes outward on the cell wall. This pressure is vital for cell expansion during growth and provides mechanical rigidity to plant tissues. Cellulose, being a strong and rigid polysaccharide, provides the primary cell wall with its mechanical strength. This allows plant cells to sustain their internal pressure and prevents them from collapsing or losing their shape. Furthermore, the presence of cellulose in the primary cell wall contributes to the resilience of plant cells. When a plant cell is subjected to mechanical stress, cellulose provides resistance and helps maintain the integrity of the cell wall. In summary, cellulose plays a crucial role in the primary cell wall of plants by providing tensile strength and contributing to the overall strength, resilience, and plasticity of plant cells. Its presence allows plant cells to develop turgor pressure, sustain internal hydrostatic pressure, and maintain their structural integrity even under mechanical stress.

Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent.

This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values, a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics. The drying rate in the falling-rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being "mass-transfer limited". In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, “impassable”) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. As a key concept in thermodynamics, the adiabatic process supports the theory that explains the first law of thermodynamics. Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient "adiabatic approximation". For example, the adiabatic flame temperature uses this approximation to calculate the upper limit of flame temperature by assuming combustion loses no heat to its surroundings. There, the process becomes a pseudo-adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because a compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as (~20%), tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore 

 total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at 200 to 400 C while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using liquid nitrogen to reduce outgassing further. A source of heat and an agent to remove the vapor produced by the process are often involved. Firstly, the rate increases with increasing temperature. This trend is attributed to the ideal mixing behavior of the two components, where the presence of ethylene glycol molecules hinders the evaporation of water molecules. For molecules of a liquid to evaporate, they must be located near the surface, they have to be moving in the proper direction, and have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular forces. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling.

It is not solely caused by surface roughness, although surface roughness and contact area can affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces. Sliding friction occurs when two contacting surfaces move relative to each other, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy or heat. When contacting surfaces move relative to each other, the friction between the two objects converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, or heat. Friction between solid objects is often referred to as dry friction or sliding friction and between a solid and a gas or liquid as fluid friction. Both of these types of friction are called kinetic friction. Surface roughness and contact area, however, do affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces. In rail vehicle dynamics, this overall slip of the wheel relative to the rail is called creepage.

Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces in contact.

To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:  Forces F1 and F2 are equal due of Newton's third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4.

Likewise, the spinning wheels of a vehicle attempt to slide backward across the ground. If the ground is not too slippery, this results in a pair of friction forces: the 'action' by the wheel on the ground in backward direction, and the 'reaction' by the ground on the wheel in forward direction. pressure, energy density, and developed temperature during sliding. If the right conditions are met, such as geometric constraints of the lump, an accumulation of energy can cause a clear change in the materials contact and plastic behaviour; generally this increases adhesion and the friction force needed for further movement. The reasons for accumulation of energy during sliding can be a reduction

In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface.

 Chromoplasts are found in fruits, flowers, roots, and stressed and aging leaves, and are responsible for their distinctive colors. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. Much chlorophyll is in photosystem II (light-harvesting complex II or LHC II), the most abundant membrane protein on earth. In the autumn, this complex is broken down.

A green leaf is green because of the presence of a pigment known as chlorophyll, which is inside an organelle called a chloroplast.

The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, "blue-green algae",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light.

Chlorophyll plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue and red portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, while it is a poor absorber of green and near-green wavelengths. This selective absorption of light is why chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll molecules capture photons of light energy. These captured photons excite electrons within the chlorophyll molecule, causing them to become energized. In this stage, chlorophyll helps convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) through a series of chemical reactions. Overall, chlorophyll's ability to absorb light energy and transfer it to other molecules allows plants to carry out photosynthesis efficiently. Its green color arises from its selective absorption properties, reflecting or transmitting green light while absorbing other colors from the visible spectrum. Reference:

The chloroplast is a specialized organelle found in plant cells that plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. These reaction centers are involved in the photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions, also known as the "light reactions." When a photon of light hits a green pigment molecule called chlorophyll in the first reaction center, it knocks an electron out of the chlorophyll, creating a positively charged chlorophyll ion. These structures house the electron-transport chains, photosynthetic light-capturing systems, and ATP synthase, which are essential for capturing energy from sunlight and converting it into chemical energy in the form of ATP.

It was first named by Haiyan Tong and Jinyou Mo in 2010 and the type species is Jiangxichelys ganzhouensis. It was an aquatic omnivore, as modern turtles are today. The pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta), also known as the pitted-shelled turtle or Fly River turtle, is a species of turtle native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is the only living member of the family Carettochelyidae, which are related to softshell turtles. This turtle is native to Vietnam and China. This animal is currently endangered. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time. It is found in the continental shelf and coastal waters of tropic regions. The distribution 

Alligator snapping turtle ; Common snapping turtle Common musk turtle (stinkpot) ; Yellow mud turtle Painted turtle ; Common map turtle ; Ouachita map turtle ; False map turtle ; River cooter ; Ornate box turtle ; Eastern box turtle ; Pond slider turtle Spiny softshell turtle ; Smooth softshell turtle Kansas is home to 15 species of turtles. Family Chelydridae – snapping turtles Family Kinosternidae – mud and musk turtles Family Emydidae – basking and box turtles Family Trionychidae – softshell turtles

2024-06-14 14:54:44 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Jiangxichelys is an extinct genus of nanhsiungchelyid turtle which existed in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, China during the latest Cretaceous epoch. It was first named by Haiyan Tong and Jinyou Mo in 2010 and the type species is Jiangxichelys ganzhouensis. It was an aquatic omnivore, as modern turtles are today. The pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta), also known as the pitted-shelled turtle or Fly River turtle, is a species of turtle native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is the only living member of the family Carettochelyidae, which are related to softshell turtles. This turtle is native to Vietnam and China. This animal is currently endangered. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time. It is found in the continental shelf and coastal waters of tropic regions. The distribution

Seaweed farming is a carbon negative crop, with a high potential for climate change mitigation. Regenerative ocean farming is a polyculture farming system that grows a mix of seaweeds and shellfish while sequestering carbon, decreasing nitrogen in the water and increasing oxygen, helping to regenerate and restore local habitat like reef ecosystems. The brown algae (singular: alga), comprising the class Phaeophyceae, are a large group of multicellular algae, including many seaweeds located in colder waters within the Northern Hemisphere. For instance, Macrocystis, a kelp of the order Laminariales, may reach 60 m in length and forms prominent underwater kelp forests. Another example is Sargassum, which creates unique floating mats of seaweed in the tropical waters of the Sargasso Sea that serve as the habitats for many species. Many brown algae, such as members of the order Fucales, commonly grow along rocky seashores. Some members of the class, such as kelps, are used by humans as food. Between 1,500 

 Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed. Traditionally, algal-based biofuels have been derived from microalgae that grow in fresh water sources. Shrikumar Suryanarayan and the 4 co-founders sought to research the viability of macroalgae (seaweed) as a fuel source. To do this, they needed a way to efficiently farm the seaweed, which led to the creation of a farming system built from a marine plastics polymer. Sea6 Energy successfully applied for a patent for their aquatic farming structure in 2012 (one of their two patents that has been published). They believe that seaweed can replace fossil fuels and other types of green fuels in a way that is both sustainable and good for the environment. The largest producer of industrial carrageenan was the Philippines, where cultivated seaweed produces about 80% of the world supply, while China is the main exporter to global markets in the US and Europe. These grow from the sea surface to a depth of about 2 metres. The seaweed is normally grown on nylon lines strung between bamboo floats, and it is harvested after three months or so, when each plant weighs approximately 1 

 Alginates are refined from brown seaweeds. Throughout the world, many of the Phaeophyceae class brown seaweeds are harvested to be processed and converted into sodium alginate. Brown seaweeds range in size from the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera which can be 20–40 meters long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2–4 m long, to smaller species 30–60 cm long. Most brown seaweed used for alginates are gathered from the wild, with the exception of Laminaria japonica, which is cultivated in China for food and its surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.

  Microalgae, also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae, constitute the majority of cultivated algae. Macroalgae commonly known as seaweed also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild. Global production of farmed aquatic plants, overwhelmingly dominated by seaweeds, grew in output volume from 13.5 million tonnes in 1995 to just over 30 million tonnes in 2016. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with kelp supplements. To minimize this risk, it is advisable to choose kelp supplements from reputable manufacturers that test their products to ensure they do not contain high levels of arsenic, such as Platinum.

This network is composed of groupings of two dilated end-sacs called terminal cisternae, and a single T-tubule (transverse tubule), which bores through the cell and emerge on the other side; together these three components form the triads that exist within the network of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, 

 Sarcoplasm is the cytoplasm of a muscle cell. It is comparable to the cytoplasm of other cells, but it contains unusually large amounts of glycogen (a polymer of glucose), myoglobin, a red-colored protein necessary for binding oxygen molecules that diffuse into muscle fibers, and mitochondria. The sarcoplasm plays a critical role in muscle contraction as an increase in Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasm begins the process of filament sliding. A decrease in Ca2+ 

 MyoD, also known as myoblast determination protein 1, is a protein in animals that plays a major role in regulating muscle differentiation. In non-vertebrate animals, a single MyoD protein is typically found. The physiological role of hemoglobin and myoglobin in the body is primarily related to their ability to bind molecular oxygen. On the other hand, myoglobin is a monomeric protein mainly found in muscle tissue and serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen. Both hemoglobin and myoglobin have a heme group, which contains iron that binds to oxygen. In summary, hemoglobin and myoglobin play crucial roles in oxygen transport and storage in the body. Hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout the body, while myoglobin stores oxygen within muscle tissue. Both proteins rely on their heme groups, which bind and release oxygen as needed. One characteristic that differentiates hemoglobin from myoglobin is their respective functions in the body. Hemoglobin is primarily responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, while myoglobin is mainly involved in storing and releasing oxygen within the muscle cells. Additionally, the structure of hemoglobin and myoglobin also differs. In contrast, myoglobin is a monomer, meaning it is composed of a single protein subunit with a heme group. This characteristic makes myoglobin better suited for oxygen storage in the muscle cells. Hemoglobin is involved in oxygen transport, consists of four protein subunits, and exhibits cooperative binding, while myoglobin plays a role in oxygen storage, is a single protein subunit, and has a higher oxygen affinity without cooperative binding. In terms of protein structure, early studies on myoglobin were important milestones in the field of protein structure determination. In terms of its role in oxygen storage, myoglobin helps regulate cellular oxygen tension in respiring tissues. This further highlights the physiological significance of myoglobin beyond its role in oxygen storage. It's worth mentioning that recent research involving myoglobin has included the development of assays for serum myoglobin detection and additives to preserve the red coloring of fresh meat. The study of myoglobin has also extended to non-muscle tissues of fish species and mammalian cancer cells, suggesting its potential involvement in other biological processes. Overall, myoglobin's significance lies in its role as an oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue and its contribution to regulating cellular oxygen tension and the bioavailability of nitric oxide. Myoglobin is distantly related to hemoglobin. Compared to hemoglobin, myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and does not have cooperative binding with oxygen like hemoglobin does. In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A, and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle. Despite being one of the most studied proteins in biology, its physiological function is not yet conclusively established: mice genetically engineered to lack myoglobin can be viable and fertile, but show many cellular and physiological adaptations to overcome the loss. Through observing these changes in myoglobin-depleted mice, it is hypothesised that myoglobin function relates to increased oxygen transport to muscle, and to oxygen storage; as well, it serves as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. In humans, myoglobin is encoded by the MB gene. Myoglobin can take the forms oxymyoglobin (MbO2), carboxymyoglobin (MbCO), and metmyoglobin (met-Mb), analogously to hemoglobin taking the forms oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), and methemoglobin (met-Hb).

Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fiber such as cellulose. in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that hydrolyze cellulose. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include dockerins and carbohydrate-binding modules.

Question: What is the most abundant substance in the plant kingdom, which no mammal produces the enzyme to digest?

 Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest Early Cretaceous and early Late Cretaceous, suggesting an earlier origin. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and 

  In the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called "soldier" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their "duties" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation in the size 

 Though all castes defend their nests in the event of invasion, a true soldier caste, with individuals called majors, exists. When a foraging area is threatened by conspecific or interspecific ant competitor, the majority of respondents are smaller workers from other castes, since they are more numerous, and therefore better suited for territorial combat. Young workers of most subcastes tend to work inside the 

 they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin). Meat ants are generally intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) living in their colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines and live in the nest commensally. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify. Complex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. The army ants of South America, such as the Eciton burchellii species, and the driver ants of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest (bivouac) from their own bodies, by holding each other 

 Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis. Many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food. A convergence, possibly a form of mimicry, is seen in the eggs of stick insects. They have an edible elaiosome-like structure and are taken into the ant nest where the young hatch. Most ants are predatory and some prey on and obtain food from other 

Pheromones play a significant role in communication among various species. For instance, ants use alarm pheromones to signal danger and alert other members of their colony. Insects like moths and butterflies release specific sex pheromones that attract potential mates from long distances. For instance, some mammals like dogs use pheromone signals to mark territory or communicate social information with other members of their species. Even plants have been found to communicate using pheromones. Overall, the examples mentioned above demonstrate how various species employ pheromones as a means of communication within their respective communities. Captured ants were classified using taxonomic keys and subsequently immersed in Brain Heart Infusion broth.

During the 1960s and 1970s, human ethologists faced several challenges when they began studying human behavior. Ethologists were accustomed to studying animal behavior, which often involved direct observation and experimentation. However, studying human behavior posed different challenges. Unlike animals in controlled laboratory settings, studying humans required access to natural environments such as kindergartens, schools, and communities. This was particularly important to ensure that the behavior being studied was a true representation of natural human behavior. Another challenge was the conceptual shift from studying animal behavior to studying human behavior. Ethologists had to adapt their knowledge and methodologies to the unique characteristics of human behavior. Additionally, there were ethico-political challenges that arose from crossing the human-animal divide. Studying human behavior raised questions about privacy, informed consent, and the ethical treatment of human subjects. Overall, the challenges faced by human ethologists in the 1960s and 1970s included developing appropriate methodologies for studying human behavior in natural settings, adapting to the unique characteristics of human behavior, and navigating the ethical considerations surrounding the study of human subjects. It draws on concepts and findings from both neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Historically, most empirical work in this field has focused on comparative neuroanatomy. One related field is comparative psychology, which examines behavior across different species to understand the evolution of cognitive abilities. By studying the evolutionary origins of neural circuits involved in behaviors such as foraging or mate selection, evolutionary neuroscience can shed light on how these circuits have been shaped by natural selection. Developmental neurobiology explores how nervous systems develop over time. Behavioral ecology examines how animals' behaviors are influenced by ecological factors. Finally, evolutionary psychology investigates how psychological traits may have evolved through natural selection. In summary, while empirical work in evolutionary neuroscience has primarily focused on comparative neuroanatomy, conceptually and theoretically it is connected to fields such as comparative psychology, neuroethology, developmental neurobiology, evo-devo, behavioral ecology, anthropology, and evolutionary psychology. A phenomenological approach can enhance our understanding of animal behavior in ethology, including a specific behavior pattern observed in mice, by providing insights into the psychological meaning and cognitive world of the animals. Unlike classical ethology, which focuses on the evolutionary, functional, mechanistic, and developmental aspects of behavior, phenomenology explores the mental processes and subjective experiences of animals. This approach encompasses empirical observations that offer preliminary insights into the behavior pattern, such as carrying the tail in mice. It recognizes that behavior cannot be solely attributed to external stimuli or physiological mechanisms. Animals used in research can experience several advantages, including improved veterinary care, advancements in disease prevention and treatment, and conservation efforts. By studying animals and their physiological responses to various treatments, scientists can enhance medical knowledge and develop better treatments for veterinary purposes. By studying the diseases in animals, researchers can develop vaccines, medications, and treatments that benefit both animals and humans. Furthermore, animals can play a crucial role in conservation efforts. By studying animals in their natural habitats and in controlled environments, researchers gain insights into their behaviors, life cycles, and the ecological systems they depend on. This information aids in the development of conservation plans, habitat management strategies, and species recovery programs, ultimately benefiting the animals themselves. In conclusion, animals used in scientific research can experience several potential benefits, including improved veterinary care, advancements in disease prevention and treatment, and contributions to conservation efforts.

In mosses, cyanobacteria are major nitrogen fixers and grow mostly epiphytically, aside from two species of Sphagnum which protect the cyanobiont from an acidic-bog environment. In terrestrial Arctic environments, cyanobionts are the primary supplier of nitrogen to the ecosystem whether free-living or epiphytic with mosses. Cyanobacterial associations with liverworts are rare, with only four of 340 genera of liverworts harbouring symbionts. Two of the genera, Marchantia and Porella, are epiphytic, while the genera Blasia and Cavicularia are endophytic. In hornworts however, endophytic cyanobionts have been described in more than triple the number of genera relative to liverworts. Bryophytes and their cyanobacterial symbionts possess different structures 

 This moss is unisexual, with males in either full-size, dwarfed or leaf-attached forms. The reproductive plant is obvious with the presence of the sporophyte. Yes, the stomata in highly elaborated Oedipodium and highly reduced Ephemerum moss sporophytes are remarkably similar. The ultrastructure of stomata in these mosses is highly similar to each other, and less variable compared to tracheophytes (vascular plants). Both Oedipodium and Ephemerum have anatomical features such as the presence of a cuticle, water-conducting cells, and spongy tissues with large areas for gas exchange. However, there are some subtle differences between the two moss species. Oedipodium sporophytes have extensive spongy tissue along the apophysis, while Ephemerum has minimal substomatal cavities. The stomatal ultrastructure and wall thickenings are highly similar in both species. Additionally, the sporophytes of both mosses are covered by a cuticle that is thicker on the guard cells and extends along the walls surrounding the pore. These anatomical features in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses support the role of stomata in gas exchange and water transport during development and maturation. The presence of stomata exclusively on the capsules of these mosses suggests that stomata in moss may also play a role in drying and dispersal of spores. Overall, while there are some differences in specific anatomical features, the ultrastructure of stomata in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses is remarkably similar, highlighting the importance of stomata in land plants for gas exchange, water transport, and potentially spore dispersal. While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor, the last eukaryotic common ancestor, the exclusion of other eukaryotes means that protists do not form a natural group, or clade. Therefore, some protists may be more closely related to animals, plants, or fungi than they are to other protists. However, like algae, invertebrates and protozoans, the grouping is used for convenience. Many protists have neither hard parts nor resistant spores, and their fossils are extremely rare or unknown. Examples of such groups include the 

What characteristics do all animals have? What are the four main categories of tissues found in the vertebrate body? Which tissues have tight junctions cell to cell junctions? Many grass lawns already have moss living under the grass. ; Moss spores are everywhere, regardless of whether moss is growing nearby, as they are carried long distances by wind; they are carried hemisphere-wide by the jet streams. ; Species are suited to the local conditions tend to do better. ; This is the technique used in Japanese moss gardens. Moss lawns can be started by several different methods: 

 The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid-19th century. For instance, colonies of cyanobacterial symbionts in the liverwort Blasia spp. are present as auricles (small dots) between the inner and outer papillae near the ventral surface of the liverworts; whereas, cyanobionts in the hornworts Anthoceros and Phaeoceros are present within the thallus', in specialized slime cavities. Members of the cyanobacterial genus Nostoc can become motile through the use of hormogonia, while the host plant excretes chemicals to guide the cyanobacteria via chemotaxis. Cells of Nostoc punctiforme, which have been shown to possess genes encoding proteins that complement chemotaxis-related proteins within flowering plants belonging to the genus Gunnera. along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths. Another characteristic feature of the species (and the genus) is its parallel photosynthetic lamellae on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Most mosses simply have a single plate of cells on the leaf surface, but common haircap moss has more highly differentiated photosynthetic tissue. This is an example of a xeromorphic adaption, an adaptation for dry conditions. Moist air is trapped in between the rows of lamellae, 

 Unlike animals, plants are immobile, and cannot seek out sexual partners for reproduction. In the evolution of early plants, abiotic means, including water and much later, wind, transported sperm for reproduction. The first plants were aquatic, as described in the page Evolutionary history of plants, and released sperm freely into the water to be carried with the currents. Primitive land plants like liverworts and mosses had motile sperm that swam in a thin film of water or were splashed in water droplets from the male reproduction organs onto the female organs. In the Paleozoic era progymnosperms reproduced by using spores dispersed on the wind. The seed plants including seed ferns, conifers and cordaites, which were all gymnosperms, evolved 350 million years ago.

They are a non-migrating species and typically stay near areas in which they were born. The POW flying squirrel tends to utilize dens in tree cavities or snags for storing food, hiding from predators, and reproduction. They do not spend much time on the ground in order to avoid predation. Northern flying squirrels are considered to be one of the most aerodynamic of mammals with the ability to travel between 3 and 45 meters in one glide. They travel between the trees to feed and in search of dens. The tail is long and typically very bushy. Nesting mothers will use their tail hair to line birthing nests. Western gray squirrels eat berries, nuts, a variety of seeds, and the eggs of small birds. They have small, rounded, highly sensitive ears and sharp teeth adapted for eating small mammals, birds, insects, frogs, and carrion. They have also been known to eat berries, birds' eggs, nuts, and honey. The European pine marten is territorial and marks its home range by depositing feces. Because the grey squirrel spends more time on the ground than the red squirrel, which co-evolved with the pine marten, they are thought to be far more likely to come in contact with this predator. These squirrels range in length from 13 to 27 cm, not including the tail which is often about the same length as the body. Most are rather dull olive-brown to gray and several have a pale and dark stripe on their side, however a few are very colorful. The Pallas's squirrel may have an unremarkable olive-gray back, while its belly is often –but not always– bright red. They are solitary, and give birth to one to five young. Their food consists of nuts, fruits, and seeds, and also of insects and bird eggs. The subgenus includes a single living species, the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) The genus name Tamias (ταμίας) means "treasurer", "steward", or "housekeeper", which is a reference to the animals' role in plant dispersal through their habit of collecting and storing food for winter use. The genus Tamias is usually divided three subgenera that, in sum, include all chipmunk species :

 The 296 g red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) of Eurasia is the most numerous mammalian prey in European studies and the sixth most often recorded prey species there overall. It is the closest relative of the Cape ground squirrel (Latin name Geosciurus inauris), which is so similar in appearance that the two are difficult to distinguish in the field. Both species have long bushy black and white tails with a white stripe from the shoulder towards the rump. Geosciurus princeps is slightly larger, on average, than G. inauris, although there is considerable overlap in body size. Differences in skull morphology also distinguish the two species, and the incisors are yellow to orange rather than white as in G. inauris. The squirrel's upper parts are mottled, with the fur containing a mixture of gray, light brown and dusky hairs. The fur around the eyes is whitish. Head and body are about 30 cm long and the tail an additional 15 cm. They can weigh from 280 to 738 g. The tail is relatively bushy for a ground squirrel, and at a quick glance, the squirrel might be mistaken for a fox squirrel. As is typical for ground squirrels, California ground squirrels live in burrows, which they excavate themselves. Some burrows are occupied communally, but each squirrel has its own entrance.

2024-06-14 14:54:47 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:They glide using a flap of skin called a patagium. They are a non-migrating species and typically stay near areas in which they were born. The POW flying squirrel tends to utilize dens in tree cavities or snags for storing food, hiding from predators, and reproduction. They do not spend much time on the ground in order to avoid predation. Northern flying squirrels are considered to be one of the most aerodynamic of mammals with the ability to travel between 3 and 45 meters in one glide. They travel between the trees to feed and in search of dens. The tail is long and typically very bushy. Nesting mothers will use their tail hair to line birthing nests. Western gray squirrels eat berries, nuts, a variety of seeds, and the eggs of small birds. They have small, rounded, highly sensitive ears and sharp teeth adapted for eating small mammals, birds, insects, frogs, and carrion. They have also been known to eat berries, birds' eggs, nuts, and honey. The European pine marten is territorial and marks its home range by depositing feces. Because the grey squirrel spends more time on the ground than the red squirrel, which co-evolved with the pine marten, they are thought to be far more likely to come in contact with this predator.

This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. They are generally found in mature tissues and are derived from preexisting mature plastids. A complex chemical pathway is involved, facilitated along the way by a range of enzymes and co-enzymes. The upward movement, known as the xylem pathway, occurs from the roots to the stems and leaves. This process is driven by transpiration, a process where water evaporates from the plant's leaves, creating a suction force that pulls water and nutrients upward. The xylem vessels in plants are responsible for this upward transportation of nutrients. On the other hand, the downward movement of nutrients, known as the phloem pathway, occurs from the leaves towards the roots. The phloem vessels are responsible for transporting sugars and other organic compounds synthesized in the leaves to the rest of the plant, including the roots. Overall, nutrient aery involves both upward and downward movements of nutrients within plants, with the xylem being responsible for upward transport and the phloem for downward transport. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant.

Firstly, the timing of fine root development and cortex sloughing differs between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In aquatic environments, fine root development and cortex sloughing occur later compared to terrestrial habitats. In both aquatic and terrestrial roots, secondary growth occurs in the vascular cambium, producing secondary xylem and phloem, and in the phellogen, producing cork.

[2024-06-14 14:54:48,643] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:As for all adult teeth, they erupt between the ages 6 to 14, with the exception of the third molar, also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age. If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken. The last ones to erupt are the four molars, one in each quarter, known as ‘wisdom tooth’. When the wisdom teeth start erupting, often there is short of space. This space crunch therefore does impede their full growth (eruption) into the mouth. Such infections give symptoms such as swelling over the back part of the jaw, inability to open the mouth (trismus), pain especially to bite on the area, a bad taste, and bad breath. Since wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt, they often create space by pushing other teeth in line when they finally emerge. In some cases, wisdom teeth come through the gums only partially or not at all (impaction). In some cases, wisdom teeth emerge normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms. A tooth that only partially erupts creates an opening for bacteria to create an infection (pericoronitis), leading to tenderness or swelling around the gums, jaw stiffness and general illness. Wisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth. There may be an incomplete formation of the enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia) that makes the teeth more vulnerable to caries (cavities). There may be missing teeth eruptions. This condition is called an anterior open bite and has facial/skeletal implications. Favorable eruption position of the second permanent molar may result if the first permanent molar is extracted when the child is at the age of between 8–10 years old. This is when the crown formation of the second permanent molar is complete and the mineralization of the bifurcation is commenced. Extraction of first permanent molars before 8 years old increases the chances of the unerupted second permanent premolar drifting distally. Extraction after the age of 10 years reduces the likelihood of the mesial movement of the second permanent molar in to the first permanent molar space and may result in tilting of the second permanent molar. Impacted wisdom teeth is a condition where the third molars (wisdom teeth) are prevented from erupting into the mouth. This can be caused by a physical barrier, such as other teeth, or when the tooth is angled away from a vertical position. Wisdom teeth likely become impacted because of a mismatch between the size of the teeth and the size of the jaw. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. Wisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry. Classification All teeth are classified as either developing, erupted (into the mouth), embedded (failure to erupt despite lack of blockage from another tooth), or impacted. Impacted teeth are ones that fail to erupt due to blockage from other teeth. Wisdom teeth, as the last teeth to erupt in the mouth are the most likely to become impacted. They develop between

Your third molars, commonly known as your wisdom teeth, are typically the last teeth to erupt in your mouth. If healthy and functional your wisdom teeth can be useful. In other cases, your wisdom teeth can become impacted or only partially erupt through the gum in a misalignment. They can also put pressure on the adjacent teeth, which can result in permanent damage to these otherwise healthy teeth and their surrounding bone. Whether your dentist or a specialist is performing the extraction the procedure is the same. Hypodontia is defined as the developmental absence of one or more teeth excluding the third molars. It is one of the most common dental anomalies and has a negative impact on both looks and function. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors. The phenomenon can be subdivided into the following according to the number of teeth concerned: 1. Hypodontia: one to six missing teeth excluding the third molars 2. Oligodontia: six or more missing permanent teeth excluding the third molars 3. Anodontia: complete absence of teeth

Question: Which teeth are the third molars, and are always the last to0 erupt?
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:54:48 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:As for all adult teeth, they erupt between the ages 6 to 14, with the exception of the third molar, also known as the wisdom teeth which normally erupt between 17 and 25 years of age. If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken. The last ones to erupt are the four molars, one in each quarter, known as ‘wisdom tooth’. When the wisdom teeth start erupting, often there is short of space. This space crunch therefore does impede their full growth (eruption) into the mouth. Such infections give symptoms such as swelling over the back part of the jaw, inability to open the mouth (trismus), pain especially to bite on the area, a bad taste, and bad breath. Since wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt, they often create space by pushing other teeth in line when they finally emerge. In some cases, wisdom teeth come through the gums only partially or not at all (impaction). In some cases, wisdom teeth emerge normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms. A tooth that only partially erupts creates an opening for bacteria to create an infection (pericoronitis), leading to tenderness or swelling around the gums, jaw stiffness and general illness. Wisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth. There may be an incomplete formation of the enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia) that makes the teeth more vulnerable to caries (cavities). There may be missing teeth eruptions. This condition is called an anterior open bite and has facial/skeletal implications. Favorable eruption position of the second permanent molar may result if the first permanent molar is extracted when the child is at the age of between 8–10 years old. This is when the crown formation of the second permanent molar is complete and the mineralization of the bifurcation is commenced. Extraction of first permanent molars before 8 years old increases the chances of the unerupted second permanent premolar drifting distally. Extraction after the age of 10 years reduces the likelihood of the mesial movement of the second permanent molar in to the first permanent molar space and may result in tilting of the second permanent molar.

The pancreas plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal or due to glycogen conversion, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream.

[2024-06-14 14:54:49,676] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system. The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. The heart has four chambers: the left and right atriums and the left and right ventricles. The atrioventricular groove hosts major coronary arteries while they travel along to the line of attachment of atrioventricular valves. The right and left ventricles are separated by a septum, which corresponds to the interventricular grooves that travel from the [[posterior to the anterior surface of the heart. In most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid. It's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body. Reference:
"The heart is a muscular organ in most animals..."

 The left atrium lies to the left and slightly posterior of the right atrium. The left atrium is slightly smaller than the right atrium and consists of the venous component, which receives saturated blood from the lungs via four pulmonary veins, the vestibule, and a narrow appendage. The heart serves as a pump controlling the blood flow in two circuits, the pulmonary and the systemic. Divisions of the Heart.

At the same time, the oxygen-rich blood that has accumulated in the left atrium returning from the pulmonary circulation pours into the left ventricle. The walls of both atria contract

 The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve and pumps it to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest. In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide.

In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. Structure Location and shape The human heart is situated in the mediastinum, at the level of thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The upper part of the heart is the

 Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis irritates the sciatic nerve, which comes into the gluteal region beneath the muscle, causing pain in the buttocks and referred pain along the sciatic nerve. Seventeen percent of the population has their sciatic nerve coursing through the piriformis muscle. Semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend the hip when the trunk is fixed; they also flex the knee and medially (inwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent. The long head of the biceps femoris extends the hip, as when beginning to walk; both short and long heads flex the knee and laterally (outwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent. Anterior and posterior movement of the hip joint capsule may help optimize the patient's stretching capacity. The muscle can be manually stretched by applying pressure perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle and parallel to the surface of the buttocks until the muscle is relaxed. The piriformis muscle and the gluteus maximus muscle have different functions in the human musculature. The piriformis muscle is pear-shaped and lies deep to the gluteus medius muscle. On the other hand, the gluteus maximus muscle is the largest and most superficial muscle in the gluteal region. The fibers of the gluteus maximus run inferolaterally and attach distally to the iliotibial tract and gluteal tuberosity of the femur. This muscle can extend the thigh from a flexed position when the pelvis is fixed, aid in strong lateral rotation of the thigh, and contribute to strong abduction at the hip. It also helps rotate the pelvis posteriorly on the femur heads when the thigh is stabilized. The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and is important for stabilizing the femur on the tibia.

Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris.

These two steps, while not part of folliculogenesis, are included for completeness. After the monthly bleeding ends, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Among these follicles, one will become dominant and continue its maturation process. When the dominant follicle is fully mature, LH triggers its release from the ovary, a process known as ovulation. The released egg then travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus for potential fertilization. After ovulation, the follicle quickly transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum then produces progesterone, which prepares the uterus for potential implantation. The primary role of the follicle is oocyte support. From the whole pool of follicles a woman is born with, only 0.1% of them will rise ovulation, whereas 99.9% will break down (in a process called follicular atresia). From birth, the ovaries of the human female contain a number of immature, primordial follicles. These follicles each contain a similarly immature primary oocyte. At puberty, clutches of follicles begin folliculogenesis, entering a growth pattern that ends in ovulation (the process where the oocyte leaves the follicle) or in atresia (death of the follicle's granulosa cells). The follicles then transition to tertiary, or antral, follicles. At this stage in development, they become dependent on hormones, particularly FSH which causes a substantial increase in their growth rate. If left undetected in women it can lead to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which in turn can create blockages in the fallopian tubes from scar tissue. Lesions also occur in the ovaries, the fallopian tubes and the pelvic sidewall. The fallopian tubes transport the egg from the ovaries to the uterus. There are two fallopian tubes in a woman’s body; both of which are lined with tiny hair-like projections called cilia, which assist the egg’s movement towards the uterus. The fallopian tubes can also be damaged by endometriosis. This procedure is used if the fimbria, the fringe of tissue located close to the ovaries that leads to the fallopian tubes and wafts the egg towards the uterus, are immobile and therefore blocking the ovum’s passage. In order to achieve pregnancy, ovulation (release of the egg from the ovary) must occur. We know this because in order for a period to come regularly there are certain events that must occur in the ovary and uterus. First, several of the immature eggs present in the ovary at the beginning of the cycle will begin developing and growing. The older a woman is, the less eggs are available every month. During the first 9 or 10 days of the cycle, one of the eggs is selected by the ovary to be the “dominant” egg that will eventually mature completely and be released. While it is maturing, the ovary produces estrogen which tells the brain that the ovary is working and also causes thickening of the uterine lining getting ready for implantation of a fertilized egg. Once this egg reaches maturity within its follicle (fluid filled cavity), a surge of hormones from the brain called LH (luteinizing hormone which can be measured by an ovulation predictor kit) causes release of the egg from its follicle. Once the egg is released, the now empty follicle is called a corpus luteum cyst and has the sole purpose of producing the hormone progesterone which acts as the glue keeping the uterine lining intact in preparation for an embryo implanting. The egg will then be picked up by one of the fallopian tubes and hopefully become fertilized by sperm in the tube and then travel into the uterus where it will implant into the thickened uterine wall. How Many Days Out of the Month is a Woman Fertile? Many people often ask, “How many days out of the month is a woman fertile?” The answer is varies from person to person, however, typically women ovulate for about 5-6 days every month. Typically the egg cell is not released or picked up at ovulation, but fertilized within the ovary where the pregnancy implants. Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy. The majority of follicles die and never complete development. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called ovulation. Definitions differ in where this shift occurs in the staging given above, with some stating that it occurs when entering the secondary stage, and others stating that it occurs when entering the tertiary stage. Until the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of meiosis I. After ovulation, several physiological changes occur in the female reproductive system. One significant change is the transformation of the ruptured follicle into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes hormones such as progesterone and estrogen, which play essential roles in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. This thickening prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. The ovulation process, which marks the release of an egg from the follicle, is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). This surge induces the release of the mature egg, which then travels through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, potentially for fertilization. These physiological changes in the female reproductive system after ovulation are crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and the preparation of the uterus for potential pregnancy.

A specialized portion of the heart, called the sinoatrial node (SA node), is responsible for atrial propagation of this potential. The pacemaker cells are connected to neighboring contractile cells via gap junctions, which enable them to locally depolarize adjacent cells. All the while being in sync with the pacemaker cells; this is the property that allows the pacemaker cells to control contraction in all other cardiomyocytes. Cells in the SA node spontaneously depolarize, ultimately resulting in contraction, approximately 100 times per minute. Because the sinoatrial node is responsible for the rest of the heart's electrical activity, it is sometimes called the primary pacemaker. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply "pacemaker") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. The reason Purkinje cells do not normally control the heart rate is that they generate action potentials at a lower frequency than the AV or SA nodes. cells can become pacemakers. It is important to realize that these cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than the primary or secondary pacemaker cells. If the SA node does not function properly and is unable to control the heart rate, a group of cells further down the heart will become the ectopic pacemaker of the heart. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40-60 beats per minute, and are called the secondary pacemaker. The left and right branches of this bundle, and the Purkinje fibers, will also produce a spontaneous action potential at a rate of 30-40 beats per minute, so if the SA and AV node both fail to function, 

 Specialized cardiomyocytes in the sinoatrial node generate electrical impulses that control the heart rate. Sinoatrial node activity is modulated, in turn, by nerve fibres of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. These systems act to increase and decrease, respectively, the rate of production of electrical impulses by the sinoatrial node. The rhythm of the heart's contractions is determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium of the heart. These pacemaker cells generate electrical impulses that stimulate the contraction of the heart muscle. The part with the highest autonomy in the human body is the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the sinus node or the sinus pacemaker. The SA node has its own intrinsic rhythm, independent of external signals. The heart rate set by the sinoatrial node is influenced by various factors, particularly the nerves that supply it. The sinoatrial node, which acts as the heart's natural pacemaker, consists of pacemaker cells that generate electrical impulses. The rate of action potentials produced by the SA node cells, and therefore the heart rate, can be affected by the autonomic nervous system. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic receptors on the SA node cells. This binding decreases the permeability of the SA node cells to calcium and potassium, leading to a slower rate of action potentials and hence a decreased heart rate. In addition to the autonomic nervous system, other factors can influence the heart rate set by the sinoatrial node. It is important to note that while the sinoatrial node plays a central role in setting the heart rate, it does not solely determine it. Reference:

Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted by the hypothalamus ; two gonadotropins: ; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ; luteinizing hormone (LH) ; estrogen ; progesterone As with most things related to the reproductive system, folliculogenesis is controlled by the endocrine system. They are: GnRH stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland that will later have a stimulatory effect on follicle growth (not immediately, however, because only antral follicles are dependent on FSH and LH). Throughout adulthood, androgens and FSH cooperatively act on Sertoli cells in the testes to support sperm production. Elevated androgen levels caused by use of androgen supplements can inhibit production of LH and block production of endogenous androgens by Leydig cells. Without the locally high levels of androgens in testes due to androgen production by Leydig cells, the seminiferous tubules can degenerate, resulting in infertility. For this reason, many transdermal androgen patches are applied to the scrotum. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads play crucial roles in regulating sex hormones. The hypothalamus, located in the brain, releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the bloodstream. In response to GnRH, the pituitary gland releases two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In males, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, an androgen hormone responsible for male sexual characteristics. FSH, on the other hand, promotes the production of sperm by stimulating the cells in the testes called Sertoli cells. Together, testosterone and sperm production are regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in males. The follicles then produce estrogen, which is responsible for the development of female sexual characteristics. Each of these stages involves the interplay of multiple hormones. In the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are secreted pulsatively, stimulating the maturation of the ovarian follicle. The increase in estrogen and progesterone levels leads to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Hormones also play a crucial role in other stages of reproduction. During fetal development, sex determination occurs under the influence of hormone signaling. In conception, hormones such as LH and FSH are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. After conception, various hormones including progesterone, estrogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and prolactin support the development of pregnancy, maintenance of the pregnancy, and initiation of lactation. Overall, hormones play a vital role in each stage of reproduction by regulating the development and function of reproductive organs, controlling the menstrual cycle, supporting pregnancy, and facilitating the physiological changes associated with sexual maturation and menopause. They provide structural support, help in hormone production and release, and create a blood-testis barrier. In the male hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH promotes the maturation of Sertoli cells, while LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. After ovulation, the remaining follicle forms the corpus luteum. The steroidogenic pathways in the ovaries involve the conversion of cholesterol to androgens, which are then converted to estrogen or progesterone. In the female hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis during the menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. FSH promotes follicular development, while LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum. It thickens during the proliferative phase in response to estrogen stimulation and prepares for potential implantation. The theory argues that these cellular changes are directed by reproductive hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis). Receptors for reproductive hormones (such as estrogens, progestogens, androgens and gonadotropins) have been found to be present in all tissues of the body. Thus, HPG axis hormones normally promote growth and development of the organism early in life in order to achieve reproduction. Hormones levels

Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. Some activities and events that have significantly impacted the troposphere in the Anthropocene era include fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, alterations in land use, and the release of certain chemicals into the atmosphere. Fossil fuel combustion, which became prevalent during the Industrial Revolution, has led to increased emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions have contributed to climate change and air pollution, affecting the troposphere. Additionally, combustion processes produce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), which can react in the atmosphere and contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. Agriculture, another significant contributor to tropospheric impact, has increased rapidly to support the growing global population. For example, the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers can lead to the release of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. These chemicals can undergo reactions in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of secondary pollutants and negatively affecting air quality. In summary, activities such as fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, alterations in land use, and the release of certain chemicals have significantly impacted the troposphere in the Anthropocene era. These impacts include climate change, air pollution, and alterations in atmospheric composition, all of which have implications for human health, visibility, climate, and weather. A better understanding of the connections between emissions, reactions, deposition, and atmospheric composition is crucial for developing strategies to minimize the impacts of these anthropogenic activities.

Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. For example, uranium-238 decays to form thorium-234. It has a very long half-life, which refers to the time it takes for half of the radioactive substance to decay into a different element. Radium is commonly found in small quantities in the Earth's crust and is a decay product of uranium and thorium. It emits alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and is known for its ability to glow in the dark. It's important to note that due to its radioactivity, radium can present health risks if not handled properly. Exposure to high levels of radium can increase the risk of cancer and other health issues. Therefore, it is crucial to follow safety protocols and guidelines when working with or around radium. Traces of 81Kr, a cosmogenic nuclide produced by the cosmic ray irradiation of 80Kr, also occur in nature: this isotope is radioactive with a half-life of 230,000 years. Krypton is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near-surface water, but 81Kr has been used for dating old (50,000–800,000 years) groundwater. It is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium, such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors. Understanding the half-life of radium-226 is crucial for various applications, including radiometric dating and medical treatments. Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides.

Activity (radioactivity): the rate of decay of radioactive material expressed as the number of atoms breaking down per second measured in units called becquerels or curies. For more information, see Chapter 2 of CDC’s Fallout Report at https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_Chapter_2.pdfCdc-pdf . Certain radioactive nuclei emit alpha particles. Alpha particles generally carry more energy than gamma or beta particles, and deposit that energy very quickly while passing through tissue. Alpha particles can be stopped by a thin layer of light material, such as a sheet of paper, and cannot penetrate the outer, dead layer of skin. Therefore, they do not damage living tissue when outside the body. When alpha-emitting atoms are inhaled or swallowed, however, they are especially damaging because they transfer relatively large amounts of ionizing energy to living cells. See also beta particle, gamma ray, neutron, x-ray. Americium (Am): a silvery metal; it is a man-made element whose isotopes Am-237 through Am-246 are all radioactive. Trace quantities of americium are widely used in smoke detectors, and as neutron sources in neutron moisture gauges.

Measured around the Equator, it is 40075.017 km. Measured around the poles, the circumference is 40007.863 km. Measurement of Earth's circumference has been important to navigation since ancient times. Treated as a sphere, determining Earth's circumference would be its single most important measurement. In modern times, Earth's circumference has been used to define fundamental units of measurement of length: the nautical mile in the seventeenth century and the metre in 

 eighteenth. Earth's polar circumference is very near to 21,600 nautical miles because the nautical mile was intended to express one minute of latitude (see meridian arc), which is 21,600 partitions of the polar circumference (that is 60 minutes × 360 degrees). circumference of the Earth 40,000 kilometres. This is why the polar circumference of the Earth is actually 40,008 kilometres, instead of 40,000. Greater precision depends more on choice of ellipsoid than on more careful measurement: the length of the equator in the World Geodetic System WGS-84 is 40,075,016.6856 m which makes the geographical mile 1855.3248 m, while the IERS Conventions (2010) takes the equator to be 40,075,020.4555 m making the geographical mile 1855.3250 m, 0.2 millimetres longer. In any ellipsoid, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles. The shape of the Earth is a slightly flattened sphere, which results in the Earth's circumference being 0.168% larger when measured around the equator as compared to through the poles. The rate of change in the angle blocked by Earth as altitude increases would be different for a disk than for a sphere. The figure Alfraganus used based on these measurements was 56 2/3 miles, giving an Earth circumference of 20400 mi. Biruni's method was intended to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts", and 

The Earth's equatorial radius a, or semi-major axis, is the distance from its center to the equator and equals 6378.1370 km. The following radii are derived from the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) reference ellipsoid. It is an idealized surface, and the Earth measurements used to calculate it have an uncertainty of ±2 m in both the equatorial and polar dimensions. The value for the equatorial radius is defined to the nearest 0.1 m in WGS-84. Refer to the WGS-84 ellipsoid if a more precise value for its polar radius is needed. Several different ways of modeling the Earth as a sphere each yield a mean radius of 6371 km. Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357 km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378 km. As explained by Cleomedes, Posidonius observed Canopus on but never above the horizon at Rhodes, while at Alexandria he saw it ascend as far as 7 1⁄2 degrees above the horizon (the meridian arc between the latitude of the two locales is actually 5 degrees 14 minutes).

The strength of dental investment for gold alloy depends on various factors, including the composition of the investment material. Gypsum, which is a type of mineral, is commonly used as a component in dental investments due to its unique properties. As a mineral, gypsum has excellent heat resistance and stability when exposed to high temperatures during the casting process. It is worth noting that while gypsum is an essential component, the strength of dental investment also relies on other variables, such as the proportions of the different ingredients, the water-to-powder ratio, and the technique used in mixing and investing. Therefore, a proper balance of all these factors is crucial to achieve optimal strength in the dental investment for gold alloy. A gypsum product refers to any material that is made primarily from gypsum, a soft mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate. Gypsum products are widely used in various industries, including construction, dentistry, and art. Some common examples of gypsum products include gypsum plaster, gypsum board (also known as drywall or plasterboard), and dental gypsum materials used for making molds and casts in dentistry. Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate, with the chemical formula CaSO4*2H2O. It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard/sidewalk chalk, and drywall. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. Silicate mineral paints or mineral colors are paint coats with mineral binding agents. Two relevant mineral binders play a role in the field of colors: Lime and silicate. Mineral colors are commonly understood to be silicate paints. Mineral silicate paint coats are considered durable and weather resistant. One of its primary uses is in the field of medicine for creating casts and dies. Gypsum is also utilized in dentistry for creating dental casts and dies. Gypsum dies, on the other hand, are used to produce precise and customized dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges. In addition to the medical and dental field, gypsum is used in various other industries. It is commonly used in construction for making plaster of Paris, which is a type of gypsum plaster used for wall and ceiling finishes. Furthermore, it has applications in the production of fertilizers, cement, and even as a filler in certain food and pharmaceutical products. Overall, gypsum plays a crucial role in the medical field by allowing for the creation of casts and dies that aid in the healing and treatment of injuries.

Observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the Big Bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition.

 According to the cosmological principle, the random distribution of matter and energy within the different parts of the universe must be approximately homogeneous and isotropic, and that random overdensities of these objects must be small if projected on a large enough scale. Given also its proximity to the Huge-LQG, CCLQG and U1.54, it will be a big contradiction to the modern cosmological model. The theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic—appearing the same in all directions regardless of location. These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. This is because, in an ordinary Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker cosmology, the Hubble radius increases more rapidly than space expands, so perturbations only enter the Hubble radius, and are not pushed out by the expansion. This paradox is resolved by cosmic inflation, which suggests that during a phase of rapid expansion in the early universe the Hubble radius was nearly constant. Thus, large scale isotropy is due to quantum fluctuations produced during cosmic inflation that are pushed outside the horizon. If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). ; Lambda (Λ), commonly known 

 Stephen Hawking and Thomas Hertog proposed that the universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today. On their theory, it is inevitable that we find our universe's "fine-tuned" physical constants, as the current universe "selects" only those past histories that led to the present conditions. An important concept in structure formation is the notion of the Hubble radius, often called simply the horizon, as it is closely related to the particle horizon. Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations. Michael Rowan-Robinson emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."

 Oberon, also designated Uranus IV, is the outermost major moon of the planet Uranus. It is likely that Oberon formed from the accretion disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. All together, they form a satellite system which is called the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus.

 36 Capricorni is a single, yellow-hued star in the southern constellation of Capricornus. It is currently moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −21 km/s, and will come within 44.58 pc in about 685,000 years ago. At the age of 2.4 billion years it has become a red clump giant, meaning it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. In the summer of 2012, AMBER interferometry with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in the Atacama Desert in Chile was used to measure the parameters of three red supergiants near the Galactic Center region: UY Scuti, AH Scorpii, and KW Sagittarii. UY Scuti was found to be the largest and the most luminous of the three stars measured, 

 UY Scuti (BD-12°5055) is a red supergiant star in the constellation Scutum. It is approximately 2.9 kpc from Earth. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would at least engulf the orbit of Jupiter. It was designated BD-12°5055, the 5,055th star between 12°S and 13°S counting from 0h right ascension. UY Scuti is located a few degrees north of the A-type star Gamma Scuti and northeast of the Eagle Nebula. Currently it is moving towards the Solar System at 41 km/s, which means in 2.35 million years it will pass at just 5.519 pc distance, probably becoming the brightest star in the night sky, at magnitude −2.1, for a period. This is giving the star an oblate shape with a prominent equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 21% larger than the polar radius. It is radiating 150 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,016 K.

 Epsilon Scuti, Latinized from ε Scuti, is a probable astrometric binary star system in the constellation Scutum. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 6.06 mas as seen from Earth, it is located approximately 540 light years from the Sun. It is moving closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of −9.8 km/s. The distance to this star is approximately 47.9 light years based on parallax measurements, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +20 km/s. The closest approach to the Sun occurred some 467,000 years ago at a separation of 6.003 pc.

South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean. South America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of Earth's surface. South America ranks fourth among all continents in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Metre and gauge lines are found in South America. Colombia and Peru have gauge lines. The range is 6999. km long, 200. to 700. km wide (widest between 18°S - 20°S latitude), and has an average height of about 4000. m. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus—some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogotá, Cali, Arequipa, Medellín, Bucaramanga, Sucre, Mérida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan plateau. It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean. Every year, the river rises more than 9 m, flooding the surrounding forests, known as várzea ("flooded forests"). In an average dry season, 110000 km2 of land 

 Minutes (′) and seconds (″) of arc are also used in cartography and navigation.

 The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world, covering an area of 6,000,000 km2 (2316612.95 square miles). It represents over half of the planet's rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Along the coast and in the northern areas of the country the climate is "warm and tropical ... with a rainy season from May to November." The temperature stays fairly consistent throughout the year because Colombia is so close to the equator. Colombia has a land size of 1138910 km2 and it is the 25th largest nation in the world and the fourth-largest country in South America (after Brazil, Argentina, and Peru). Nine countries have territory in the Amazon River basin or immediately adjoin this region: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The Andes extends from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Both regions have many endemic species. Habitats in these two regions are very various and include Amazon rainforest, Atlantic forest, Llanos grasslands, Puna grassland and Valdivian temperate rain forest.

The range is 6999. km long, 200. to 700. km wide (widest between 18°S - 20°S latitude), and has an average height of about 4000. m. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus—some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogotá, Cali, Arequipa, Medellín, Bucaramanga, Sucre, Mérida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan plateau. It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean. Every year, the river rises more than 9 m, flooding the surrounding forests, known as várzea ("flooded forests"). In an average dry season, 110000 km2 of land 

 Minutes (′) and seconds (″) of arc are also used in cartography and navigation. At sea level one minute of arc along the equator equals exactly one geographical mile along the Earth's equator or approximately 1 nmi. Positions are traditionally given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of arcs for latitude, the arc north or south of the equator, and 

 The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world, covering an area of 6,000,000 km2 (2316612.95 square miles). It represents over half of the planet's rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Along the coast and in the northern areas of the country the climate is "warm and tropical ... with a rainy season from May to November." The temperature stays fairly consistent throughout the year because Colombia is so close to the equator. Colombia has a land size of 1138910 km2 and it is the 25th largest nation in the world and the fourth-largest country in South America (after Brazil, Argentina, and Peru). Nine countries have territory in the Amazon River basin or immediately adjoin this region: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The Andes extends from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Both regions have many endemic species. Habitats in these two regions are very various and include Amazon rainforest, Atlantic forest, Llanos grasslands, Puna grassland and Valdivian temperate rain forest. The two regions (Amazon and Andes) are South America proper excluding the pampas

  Bingo is a game of probability in which players mark off numbers on cards as the numbers are drawn randomly by a caller, the winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers. Bingo, also previously known in the UK as "Housey-Housey", became increasingly popular across the UK following the Betting and Gaming Act 1960 with more purpose-built bingo halls opened every year until 2005. Since 2005, bingo halls have seen a marked decline in revenues and the closure of many halls. The number of bingo clubs in Britain has dropped from nearly 600 in 2005 to under 400 as of January, 2014. These closures are blamed on high taxes, the smoking ban, and the rise in online gambling, amongst other things.

However, according to jurist and Red Cross historian Pierre Boissier, no clear evidence of this origin has been found; the concept that the design was chosen to complement the country in which the convention at which it was adopted was held, was also promoted later to counter the objections of Turkey that the flag was a Christian symbol. Today, the flag no longer simply stands for European unity, but for the political struggle for a European federation. The flag has been commonly used by citizens, hoisting it at border crossings following the Second World War, in the 1970s calling for direct European elections, by over 100,000 protesters in Milan calling for the adoption of the Spinelli Treaty (which would have created a European federation but was not adopted) and likewise by tens of thousands supporting the European Constitution at the 2000 Nice European Council. This has given it a character, unlike the European Union flag, of signifying struggle, in the fight against nationalism and against unionists who agree with European unity but are not willing to accept a federation which the federalists describe as "the self-evident consequences". It was renewed in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and in World War I. It also appeared in the canton of the war flag of the German Empire. On the blades of the cross is the motto Gott mit uns. The colours red, white, and green represent the national colours of Hungary, as featured on the nation's flag.

 A true toad is any member of the family Bufonidae, in the order Anura (frogs and toads). This is the only family of anurans in which all members are known as toads, although some may be called frogs (such as harlequin frogs). On the other hand, species like Rana clamitans (green frogs) spend longer periods as larvae (3-10 months) and weigh more (3 g) at metamorphosis. Species like Rana palustris (pickerel frogs) fall between wood frogs and green frogs in terms of larval duration and size at metamorphosis. American toads and wood frogs tend to delay dispersal, allowing them to undergo rapid growth and development after metamorphosis. The smaller body sizes of newly metamorphosed toads and wood frogs impose limitations on their behaviors. Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. This is in contrast to terrestrial amphibians, which rely on lungs for gas exchange. Secondly, larval and adult amphibians have different hemoglobin compositions. No globin chains are shared between larval and adult amphibians. Adult amphibians generally have higher hemoglobin concentrations and packed cell volumes (PCVs) compared to larval forms. Metamorphosis in newts and salamanders may not result in a transition in hemoglobin affinity like in frogs and toads. However, when newts and salamanders switch from aquatic to aerobic respiration at metamorphosis, both larval and adult hemoglobins exhibit the same affinity for oxygen. Lastly, toads, which primarily rely on aerobic respiration, tend to have higher hemoglobin and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations and lower blood oxygen affinity compared to frogs, which primarily rely on anaerobic respiration. These differences in oxygen transport mechanisms reflect the varying physiological adaptations amphibians undergo during their life cycle and their transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.

The games played with dominoes largely center around playing a domino from the player's "hand" onto the matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's hand onto the board.

Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games. Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles.

Doubles are placed endwise and count the same as single dominoes. Blanks are closed to play of any domino other than a "matador." The traditional domino set contains one unique piece for each possible combination of two ends with zero to six spots, and is known as a double-six set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the "double six").

These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare ("extradite or prosecute") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other "internationally protected persons". The National Criminal Investigation Service (Den nasjonale enhet for bekjempelse av organisert og annen alvorlig kriminalitet, previously Kriminalpolitisentralen), commonly known as Kripos, is a special agency of the Norwegian Police Service. Based at Bryn in Oslo and established in 1959, it is a national unit that works with organized and serious crime.

China moved to the next step in its space program, with the launch of a dog into outer space. The male dog, "Xiao Bao" was sent up inside a T-7AS2 rocket, reaching an altitude of 115 km.

A physician is rarely included as part of a space flight crew. In 1973, Dr. Joseph Kerwin was the first U.S. physician selected for astronaut training, serving as the Science Pilot for the Skylab2 mission to the first U.S. orbital space station. Like Dr. Kerwin, when physicians have flown, they have served as scientists, engineers, spacewalkers, and project managers. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata performs an ultrasound scan using the Human Research Facility (HRF) Ultrasound2 on Expedition 38. Surprisingly, few serious medical emergencies in space have been reported. While documented conditions have included urosepsis, renal colic, cellulitis, pneumonitis, and cardiac arrhythmia, only 17 of these nonfatal severe medical events have been reported during spaceflight between 1961-1999.1 The relatively benign nature of medical problems in space flight is likely due to shorter missions, selection of healthy astronauts, on-board medications, and countermeasures to environmental effects and prolonged microgravity.2 The comprehensive profiling process includes an evaluation of astronauts' physiological and psychosocial well-being, medical history, and extensive laboratory and genetic markers. Mae Jemison, MD, (a general practitioner) floats in zero gravity at the Spacelab Japan Science module aboard STS-105, Endeavour. With recent aerospace successes, such as the launch of the Orion spacecraft in December 2014, the Curiosity mission in Mars, and unmanned missions to comets and asteroids, the future of space flight seems promising. Plans for commercial space flight to the International Space Station (ISS), interplanetary expeditions, a return to the moon, colonization of neighboring planets, and establishment of bases are underway. For example, one study estimates that the risk of an emergency medical event during a 7-member space flight to Mars would be about 1 emergency event per trip. Charles Darwin wrote of a first-generation hybrid kept in the London Zoo 

It is inevitable that medical conditions of varying complexity, severity and emergency will occur during spaceflight missions with human participants. Different levels of care are required depending on the problem, available resources and time required to return to Earth. As the distance that missions travel from Earth increases, more possible medical conditions and types of trauma need to be evaluated. To date, arrhythmias, renal colic, venous thrombosis, and infections have been documented during space flights. Other medical emergencies that have been observed in space include rare but real cases of urological and dental emergencies. Additional consideration substantiates the risk of the inability to treat crew members on long-duration missions. Emergencies due to radiation exposure would most likely be catastrophic and mission ending. Other risks Other considerations for designing space medical care systems include exposure to toxic substances, chemical burns, electrical burns and trauma (on board and during EVA's). Exposure to a range of hazards including chemical substances, microbes, radiation and noise can be prevented or controlled by the application of effective astronautical hygiene practice. A 2006 Space Shuttle experiment found that Salmonella typhimurium, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, became more virulent when cultivated in space.

 In 1951, Eric Morley organised a bikini contest as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations that he called the Festival Bikini Contest. The event was popular with the press, and was dubbed "Miss World" by the media. When the 1951 Miss World pageant winner, Kerstin "Kiki" Hakansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, it added to the controversy. However, on 2 July 2019, Morley and Vanessa Ponce, the reigning Miss World, appeared on ITV's Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan.

 The music video for "Damaged" was directed by Syndrome and premiered on March 11, 2008, on MTV's TRL, where it peaked at number 3 on its countdown. In its entirety it premiered on MTV.com. The video also premiered as the 'New Joint' on BET's 106 & Park on March 20, 2008. The video was first released in 1979, when it originally aired on the BBC's Top of the Pops for promotion of the single, in lieu of doing live performances. Zimmer recalled in 2001 that the video drew criticism from some viewers who watched it before it aired on MTV, due to being "'too violent' because we blew up a television." The video is best known as marking the debut of MTV, when the US channel started broadcasting at 12:01 AM on 1 August 1981. On 27 February 2000, it became the one-millionth video to be aired on MTV. It also opened MTV Classic in the UK and Ireland. The video marked the closing of MTV Philippines before its shutdown on 15 February 2010 at 11:49 PM.

[2024-06-14 14:55:09,197] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: While working for the inventor Thomas Edison at Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Hammer was in charge of testing early electric light globes in 1880 through 1881. In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC). The exclusion of air was essential to maximize the life of the filament. Edison had chosen a carbonized (burned) 

 was flowing not only through the filament but also through the evacuated bulb, a phenomenon initially reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie in Britain. In order to measure this flow, he made a special bulb with a third electrode, to which he could attach an instrument to measure the current. He reasoned that if the current would flow between the two ends of the filament, it would also flow to this third electrode. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. he did patent the new device, because he believed that it might have some commercial applications, such as measuring electric current. Hammer found that under certain conditions of vacuum and voltage he observed a blue glow around the positive pole in a vacuum bulb and a blackening of the wire and the inside of the glass bulb at the positive pole. Hammer's discovery was first called "Hammer's Phantom Shadow," but when Edison patented the electric light bulb in 1883 this thermionic emission became known as the "Edison Effect," and was patented on November 15, 1883 (U.S. patent 307,031). When the bulb's filament is heated white-hot, electrons are 

 finance during his time at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; "to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development." Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. The company became known as Consolidated Edison. Trask was an original trustee of the Edison Electric Light Company, the predecessor to the General Electric Company, being for many years a member of the executive committee. filament for his new lamp, but this solution was not perfect. After being heated to incandescence for a few hours, carbon from the filament would be deposited on the inside walls of the bulb, turning it black.

Question: Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, was afraid of the dark?
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:55:09 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: While working for the inventor Thomas Edison at Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Hammer was in charge of testing early electric light globes in 1880 through 1881. In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC). The exclusion of air was essential to maximize the life of the filament. Edison had chosen a carbonized (burned) 

 was flowing not only through the filament but also through the evacuated bulb, a phenomenon initially reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie in Britain. In order to measure this flow, he made a special bulb with a third electrode, to which he could attach an instrument to measure the current. He reasoned that if the current would flow between the two ends of the filament, it would also flow to this third electrode. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments. he did patent the new device, because he believed that it might have some commercial applications, such as measuring electric current. Hammer found that under certain conditions of vacuum and voltage he observed a blue glow around the positive pole in a vacuum bulb and a blackening of the wire and the inside of the glass bulb at the positive pole. Hammer's discovery was first called "Hammer's Phantom Shadow," but when Edison patented the electric light bulb in 1883 this thermionic emission became known as the "Edison Effect," and was patented on November 15, 1883 (U.S. patent 307,031). When the bulb's filament is heated white-hot, electrons are 

 finance during his time at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; "to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development." Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. The company became known as Consolidated Edison. Trask was an original trustee of the Edison Electric Light Company, the predecessor to the General Electric Company, being for many years a member of the executive committee. filament for his new lamp, but this solution was not perfect. After being heated to incandescence for a few hours, carbon from the filament would be deposited on the inside walls of the bulb, turning it black. Hammer noticed the carbon seemed to be coming from the end of the filament that was attached to the negative terminal of the DC power supply, and seemed to be flying through the vacuum onto the walls of the bulb, a phenomenon that Edison observed in 1875.

The gritty sensation elicited by oxalate-rich foods such as spinach may also be described as "chalky teeth'. Orthodontic treatment can cause increased tooth mobility as well. Acrophobia is a common phobia and can have a significant impact on a person's daily life. It can lead to avoidance of situations such as climbing stairs, crossing bridges, or riding elevators, which can limit their freedom and restrict their activities. Additionally, acrophobia can also cause physiological symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, and a sense of impending doom or panic attack. Traumatic experiences or accidents involving heights can contribute to the development of this phobia. Treatment for acrophobia often includes a combination of therapy techniques. In conclusion, acrophobia is an intense and irrational fear of heights that can significantly impact a person's life. It is treatable through various therapy techniques, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy. These traumas may also be isolated or associated with other facial trauma.

However, this depends on the type of dental trauma, as clinical findings show some types of trauma may not affect mobility at all. Thanatophobia is a term used to describe an intense and persistent fear of death. It is a specific phobia that can cause significant distress and impair an individual's daily functioning. People with thanatophobia often have an overwhelming fear of their own death or the death of loved ones. This fear may be triggered by thoughts of dying, witnessing death, or being in situations related to mortality, such as hospitals or funerals. Symptoms of thanatophobia can vary from person to person but may include extreme anxiety, panic attacks, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, nausea, and a sense of impending doom. The exact causes of thanatophobia are not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Traumatic experiences, such as the loss of a loved one or a near-death experience, may also contribute to the development of this phobia.

He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development.

 Nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as "dynamite". Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year, at a quarry in Redhill, Surrey, England. In order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with dangerous explosives, Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance "Nobel's Safety Powder", but settled with Dynamite instead, referring to the Greek word for "power" (δύναμις). On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful

Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard "Biff" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark "Spike" Stent. "Wannabe" is a moderately paced dance-pop song 

 The trigger for the Spice Girls' launch was the release of the "Wannabe" music video in May 1996. Its quick success on the British cable network The Box sparked press interest, despite initial resistance to the all-girl group idea. After the song was placed into heavy rotation on FM stations in Japan, the Spice Girls made promotional tours in May, July, and September 1996. The group received major press and TV exposure, appearing in programmes such as Space Shower. "Wannabe" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number three, six days after its physical release, with sales 

 As the Spice Girls' debut single, "Wannabe" has been credited for catapulting the band to global stardom and ushering in "Spicemania" in the late 1990s. Commentators have noted that the song and its accompanying video, both now considered modern pop classics, served as a wonderful introduction to the band. The Metro's Jon O’Brien concluded that: "From its lyrical themes of female solidarity to its insanely catchy pop hooks and mischief-making promo, the worldwide chart-topper encapsulated everything that made the group so spellbinding in the space of just two minutes and 52 seconds." Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. During the Spice Girls hiatus, Bunton released her debut solo album, A Girl Like Me (2001), which debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

After C comes the key of G (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A). For example, the octave from c′–b′ is called the one-line octave or (less common) once-accented octave. Correspondingly, the notes in the octave may be called one-lined C (for c′), etc. temperament system. Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones. The key signatures associated with those pitches also change: the key of G has one sharp, the key of D has 2 sharps, and so on. Similarly, proceeding counterclockwise from the top of the circle, the notes change by descending fifths and the key signatures change accordingly: the key of F has one flat, the key of B has 2 flats, and so 

 In music, flat (Italian bemolle for "soft B") means "lower in pitch". Flat is the opposite of sharp, which is a raising of pitch. In musical notation, flat means "lower in pitch by one semitone (half step)", notated using the symbol which is derived from a stylised lowercase 'b'. For instance, the music below has a key signature with three flats (indicating either E major or C minor) and the note, D, has a flat accidental. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents. In intonation, flat can also mean "slightly lower in pitch" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is "flat" with respect to the other. This is used, for example, in Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. If only one or two of the notes are common, then we call it common tone modulation." Thus common-tone modulations are convenient for modulation by diatonic or chromatic third. In chords, the length is only given for the first note mentioned. These may be prefixed by ♯,  ♭, or  ♮, and suffixed by  dot (length × 1½). The note is preceded by its octave, which is written as the number plus an upper dot:  5th 8va,  2nd 8va, etc. The sign signals a change in octave. Such keys with double accidentals in the key signatures are called theoretical keys: the appearance of their key signatures is extremely rare, but they are sometimes tonicised in the course of a work (particularly if the home key was already heavily sharped or flatted). The medieval conception of the tetrachordal structure, however, was based on one single tetrachord, that of the D scale, each formed of a semitone between tones, T–S–T.

In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (Paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch (from "Hungarian")) and salted (gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like "Chakalaka", "Currywurst", "Pommes" (french fries), "Rot-weiss" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). French fries (North American English), chips (British English), finger chips (Indian English), French-fried potatoes, or simply fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating from either Belgium or France. Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes. French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine or chili cheese fries. ; flatware : knives, spoons, and forks (as opposed to holloware); (UK usually cutlery [DM] ; freeway : (see article) (UK: motorway) ; French press : Device for making coffee (UK: cafetière) ; freshman : a first-year student in college or high school (fresher in UK) ; French fries (or fries) * : pieces of potato that have been deep-fried. (UK: chips [DM]; "French fries" is known via American fast food chains, due to which it usually refers to the thin, crispy variety of chips served there) ; frosting : A confection applied to cakes (US and UK: icing) ; front desk : (UK: reception) ; frosh, see freshman 

 In the United States, potato chips are made by national chains like Frito-Lay, Pringles and Kettle Brand; major regional brands like Jay's of Chicago, Better Made of Detroit, Old Dutch of Minneapolis, and Utz of Hanover, Pennsylvania; and specialty brands with local or uneven distribution. The thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3–4 mm). Pommes gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries. French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words). In the UK, chips are considered a separate item to french fries. A blue plaque in Oldham marks the 

 fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. This was originally a general term for cooking eggs in a skillet, anywhere on the spectrum from fried egg, through conventional omelette, to an Italian version of the Spanish omelette, made with fried potato.

Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:55:14 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:The fried sweet potatoes tradition dates to the early nineteenth century in the United States. In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (Paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch (from "Hungarian")) and salted (gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like "Chakalaka", "Currywurst", "Pommes" (french fries), "Rot-weiss" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). French fries (North American English), chips (British English), finger chips (Indian English), French-fried potatoes, or simply fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes, originating from either Belgium or France. Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes. French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine or chili cheese fries. ; flatware : knives, spoons, and forks (as opposed to holloware); (UK usually cutlery [DM] ; freeway : (see article) (UK: motorway) ; French press : Device for making coffee (UK: cafetière) ; freshman : a first-year student in college or high school (fresher in UK) ; French fries (or fries) * : pieces of potato that have been deep-fried.

 In the United States, potato chips are made by national chains like Frito-Lay, Pringles and Kettle Brand; major regional brands like Jay's of Chicago, Better Made of Detroit, Old Dutch of Minneapolis, and Utz of Hanover, Pennsylvania; and specialty brands with local or uneven distribution. The thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3–4 mm). Pommes gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries. French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words). In the UK, chips are considered a separate item to french fries. A blue plaque in Oldham marks the 

 fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. This was originally a general term for cooking eggs in a skillet, anywhere on the spectrum from fried egg, through conventional omelette, to an Italian version of the Spanish omelette, made with fried potato.

2024-06-14 14:55:17 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Houses commonly have only one or two floors. Buildings are often classified as low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise according to how many levels they contain, but these categories are not well-defined. The tallest skyscraper in the world, Burj Khalifa, has 163 floors. The height of each storey is based on the ceiling height of the rooms plus the thickness of the floors between each pane. Storeys within a building need not be all the same height—often the lobby is taller, for example. In English, the principal floor or

 Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France. Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to annex Luxembourg into its empire. The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality. Although this agreement was signed on a river boat on the river Moselle near Schengen, at the border triangle of Lorraine, Luxembourg and Saarland, it was not created especially for the use of the region, but the whole of the founding members: the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Republic, and now 28 European States. Moutfort (French) (Mutfert, Mutfort) is a village in the commune of Contern, in south-western Luxembourg, on both sides of the road from the city of Luxembourg to the German border town Remich. , the village of Moutfort had a population of 1,306 inhabitants, and the associated village of Medingen had 112 inhabitants. This very great mixture of nationalities is due to the proximity of the commune of Contern to the city of Luxembourg, which is reachable by car in 10 minutes.

 Bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany, Luxembourg has a population of over half a million people in an area of 2,586 km2. Its strategic importance dates back to a Roman era fortress and Frankish count's castle site in the Early Middle Ages. While Luxembourgers are fluent in all three of their official languages, German, French and Luxembourgish, most also have a good working knowledge of English. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised. Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for Albrecht von Württemberg's Fourth Army. One of the railways from the northern Rhineland into France passed through Troisvierges, in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of Troisvierges station.

The commune is located in the Pays de Sierck at the confluence of the Sauer (known in French as the Sûre) and the Moselle, which form the borders with Luxembourg and Germany. Just over the border in Germany is the town of Perl in Saarland, and the neighboring town in Luxembourg is Schengen. Common economic problems arising from drastic changes in the industrial and coal mining areas of the four countries have led to the creation of a community of interest and to the development of common projects like the European Development Pole in the cross-border area of Longwy in France, Rodange in Luxembourg and Athus in Belgium. The European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and Meuse presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the European Union. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing.

The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality. Although this agreement was signed on a river boat on the river Moselle near Schengen, at the border triangle of Lorraine, Luxembourg and Saarland, it was not created especially for the use of the region, but the whole of the founding members: the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Republic, and now 28 European States. Moutfort (French) (Mutfert, Mutfort) is a village in the commune of Contern, in south-western Luxembourg, on both sides of the road from the city of Luxembourg to the German border town Remich. , the village of Moutfort had a population of 1,306 inhabitants, and the associated village of Medingen had 112 inhabitants. This very great mixture of nationalities is due to the proximity of the commune of Contern to the city of Luxembourg, which is reachable by car in 10 minutes. It is usual to speak four or five languages in 

 Bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany, Luxembourg has a population of over half a million people in an area of 2,586 km2. Its strategic importance dates back to a Roman era fortress and Frankish count's castle site in the Early Middle Ages. While Luxembourgers are fluent in all three of their official languages, German, French and Luxembourgish, most also have a good working knowledge of English. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised. Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for Albrecht von Württemberg's Fourth Army. One of the railways from the northern Rhineland into France passed through Troisvierges, in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of Troisvierges station. The next day, while French troops were still at a distance from the 

 Contz-les-Bains (Lorraine Franconian: Nidderkonz, Niederkontz) is a commune in the Moselle department in Grand Est in north-eastern France. The commune is located in the Pays de Sierck at the confluence of the Sauer (known in French as the Sûre) and the Moselle, which form the borders with Luxembourg and Germany. Just over the border in Germany is the town of Perl in Saarland, and the neighboring town in Luxembourg is Schengen. Common economic problems arising from drastic changes in the industrial and coal mining areas of the four countries have led to the creation of a community of interest and to the development of common projects like the European Development Pole in the cross-border area of Longwy in France, Rodange in Luxembourg and Athus in Belgium. The European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and Meuse presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the European Union. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing. Despite the armistice ending the war, and the end of the revolts, Luxembourg's own future was still uncertain. However, fearing loss of influence over the left bank of the Rhine, France

[2024-06-14 14:55:21,028] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: The following list, of about 350 words, is based on documented lists of the top 100, 200, or 400 most commonly misspelled words in all variants of the English language, rather than listing every conceivable misspelled word. Each word is followed by examples of misspellings:

 in about, comma, solar. is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after and ), and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French. A selected list of common words is presented below, under Documented list of common misspellings. Although the word common is subjective depending on the situation, the focus is on general writing, rather than in a specific field. Accepted spellings also vary by country or region, with some rejecting the American or British variants as incorrect for the region. Within a particular field of study, such as computer graphics, other words might be more common for misspelling, such as "pixel" misspelled as "pixle" (or variants "cesium" and "caesium"). Sometimes words are purposely misspelled, as a form in slang, abbreviations, or in song lyrics, etc. In general writing, some words are frequently misspelled, such as the incorrect spelling "" for "consensus" found in numerous webpages. Other common misspellings include "" (for "equipment"), "" (for "independent"), "readible" (for readable), or "usible" (for usable or useable). In many languages, certain characters are used more frequently than others. Examples of more frequent characters in English are the vowels, m, r, s, t...etc. As people process the first character of the word, they make a mental prediction of what the word is before reading the rest of the characters. If the character and other preprocessing information indicates that the word is short and familiar, the reader is more likely to skip the entire word. The character frequency may be more important when reading than the frequency of the word as a whole. Word frequency depends on individual awareness of the tested language. The phenomenon can be extended to different characters of the word in non-alphabetic languages such as Chinese. A word is considered to be high frequency if the word is commonly used in daily speech, such as the word "the". A word is considered to be low frequency if the word is not commonly used, such as the word "strait". There is frequency at the character level or at the word level. There is also an effect of frequency at the orthographic level. This difference persisted, though slightly smaller (17%) when participants recalled words after a 15-min waiting period. To limit the scope to common words, the top 350 words are considered (according to various sources). In several studies, participants read a list of high or low frequency words along with nonwords (or pseudowords). According to the "law", given some dataset of text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency rank. In other words, the second most common word should appear about half as often as the most common word, and the fifth most common world would appear about once every five times the most common word appears.

Sometimes words are purposely misspelled, as a form in slang, abbreviations, or in song lyrics, etc. In general writing, some words are frequently misspelled, such as the incorrect spelling "" for "consensus" found in numerous webpages. Other common misspellings include "" (for "equipment"), "" (for "independent"), "readible" (for readable), or "usible" (for usable or useable). In many languages, certain characters are used more frequently than others. Examples of more frequent characters in English are the vowels, m, r, s, t...etc. As people process the first character of the word, they make a mental prediction of what the word is before reading the rest of the characters. If the character and other preprocessing information indicates that the word is short and familiar, the reader is more likely to skip the entire word. The character frequency may be more important when reading than the frequency of the word as a whole. Word frequency depends on individual awareness of the tested language. The phenomenon can be extended to different characters of the word in non-alphabetic languages such as Chinese. A word is considered to be high frequency if the word is commonly used in daily speech, such as the word "the". A word is considered to be low frequency if the word is not commonly used, such as the word "strait". There is frequency at the character level or at the word level. There is also an effect of frequency at the orthographic level. This difference persisted, though slightly smaller (17%) when participants recalled words after a 15-min waiting period. To limit the scope to common words, the top 350 words are considered (according to various sources). In several studies, participants read a list of high or low frequency words along with nonwords (or pseudowords). According to the "law", given some dataset of text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency rank. In other words, the second most common word should appear about half as often as the most common word, and the fifth most common world would appear about once every five times the most common word appears.

[2024-06-14 14:55:21,711] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: The femur is the only bone in the thigh and serves as an attachment site for all muscles in the thigh. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee. In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee. The hip joint must be able to accommodate these extreme forces repeatedly during intense physical exercise.The femur may also circumduct about 90 degrees around its axis at the hip joint.As well as this strength, the hip joint still enjoys a large range of motion, with its ball-and-socket structure allowing free movement of the femur through 360 degrees.This cartilage provides a smooth surface for the moving bones to glide across each other, as well as acting as a flexible shock absorber to prevent the collision of the bones during movement. The three main ligaments involved are the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral. It is also important to understand that the femur does not run down the middle of the thigh in a proximal to distal direction. At the hip the left and right femoral heads are separated by the width of the pelvis, whereas at the knee the two lower ends are almost touching. The shaft of the femur is therefore very oblique and is more pronounced in a female because of the wider pelvis. At the distal end of the femur, two rounded condyles meet the tibia and fibula bones of the lower leg, to form the knee joint. As well as this strength, the hip joint still enjoys a large range of motion, with its ball-and-socket structure allowing free movement of the femur through 360 degrees. The hip joint must be able to accommodate these extreme forces repeatedly during intense physical exercise.Gluteus maximus arises from the ilium, the sacrotuberous ligament, and the posterior aspects of the sacrum and coccyx; its deeper fibers pass obliquely downward and forward, to attach to the gluteal tuberosity on the posterior surface of the femur. These terms are used to describe bony protuberances in specific parts of the body. The Malleolus ("small hammer") is the bony prominence on each side of the ankle. Each leg is supported by two bones, the tibia on the inner side (medial) of the leg and the fibula on the outer side (lateral) of the leg. In humans, it is more common in men than women, older individuals compared to younger, and there is high regional variation, with fabellae being most common in people living in Asia and Oceania and least common in people living in North America 

The distal end of the femur, or thigh bone, has several important features that contribute to its function in the skeletal structure. This head forms part of the hip joint, connecting with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone. The angled neck of the femur allows for efficient weight-bearing and distribution of forces during movements such as walking or running. The trochanter serves as an attachment point for various muscles of the hip, including the gluteal muscles. The hip is located where the top of the femur bone, or thighbone, fits into the pelvis. The femur bone is the longest bone in the body, extending from the knee to the hip. At the top of the femur bone is the greater trochanter, that boney knob that people often refer to as their hip, and the bulbous "femoral head" which makes contact with the pelvis and forms the ball of the ball and socket joint. The femoral head fits into the acetabulum, the round socket of the pelvic bone. Both the femoral head and the acetabulum are lined with articular cartilage. When the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum, the articular cartilage allows the two surfaces to glide against each other. A strong piece of cartilage, called the labrum, rings the outer edge of the acetabulum. The labrum deepens the socket joint, making the joint more stable, but its elasticity allows for flexibility. Over time the smooth articular cartilage that makes up the surfaces of the hip joint may be damaged or blemished by normal wear and tear or from trauma. The hip has several ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvis and tendons connecting the bones to many surrounding muscles. Strong and flexible ligaments and tendons provide structure to the hip, reducing strain on the joint, so most hip osteoarthritis therapies will including stretching and strengthening of these structures. When the hip is at rest, the synovial fluid is stored in the cartilage, much like water in a sponge. When the hip rotates or bears weight the synovial fluid is squeezed out. Small sacs of synovial fluid, called bursae (singular is "bursa") surround all major joints, including the hip joint. Together, these muscles support the hip joint, so exercises

It is important for anaesthetists to make workplace adjustments to optimize their performance with their dominant hands because the performance of the non-dominant hand can have a detrimental effect on critical task performance. Studies have shown that most people, regardless of handedness, use their dominant hand for tasks that require accuracy. This means that anaesthetists, who often need to perform precise actions during procedures, should prioritize using their dominant hand. In a study conducted in Korea, it was found that only 6% of participants were left-handed and 8% were ambidextrous.

From wielding a club to threading a needle, our hands enable us to engage in both rough motor skills and fine motor skills. One crucial function of the hands is their ability to provide tactile feedback. The fingertips contain a high concentration of nerve endings, making them incredibly sensitive to touch. This allows us to explore and interact with objects in our surroundings, enhancing our sense of touch.

It is the third book of Robinson's "RAF Quartet", which began with Piece of Cake in 1983 and continued with A Good Clean Fight in 1993. Like all of Robinson's novels, Damned Good Show points out the inadequacies of the pre-war establishment and the many hurdles that Bomber Command had to overcome during the course of the war, such as inadequate aircraft—in this case the Handley Page Hampden, and the inaccuracy of the night-time bombing raids on Germany.

A card cheat will typically bend some of the important cards during the game. In poker, for instance, a cheat may crimp one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page. Another poker scenario (also popular in numerous other games) is to crimp some of the high-value cards 

 A disgorger is used in coarse fishing to remove a fish hook from deep inside the mouth of a fish that is not possible to reach using fingers alone. It is typically made of plastic or metal and is used on smaller fish. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, 

 single-deck games better for counters. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Haggis is a shedding card game similar to Tichu, Zheng Fen, and other East Asian climbing games. Haggis has received praise for being the first to successfully create a climbing, trick-taking game, designed from the start for two to three players, where most previous games required four players or more. The evenly distributed, face card "bombs" are a notable innovation for the genre, helping even out hand strength enough to make two-person play workable, and enhancing the strategic element of the game. The game's designer, Sean Ross, developed Haggis over a period of several years, with first publication in late 2010 by Indie Boards and Cards. The game was named after haggis partly in a nod to Ross' Scottish heritage, but also because the game brought together the "guts" (scoring and play mechanisms) of several other climbing games. Haggis was a nominee for "Best Card Game" in the 2010 Golden Geek Awards by BoardGameGeek. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential leg before wicket (lbw) appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit 

 Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game allows players to construct a sensei deck in addition to the main playing deck (known as a life deck), which requires the use of a sensei card. This is a draw game that plays much like a stud game. Now, in place of a second round and showdown, there is a rollout phase, which begins with the players arranging their five cards in any chosen order, placing them face down in front of themselves. This game can be played for high or low, but plays best at high-low split, in which case it is called "Skinny Minnie".

 A disgorger is used in coarse fishing to remove a fish hook from deep inside the mouth of a fish that is not possible to reach using fingers alone. It is typically made of plastic or metal and is used on smaller fish. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, 

 single-deck games better for counters. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Haggis is a shedding card game similar to Tichu, Zheng Fen, and other East Asian climbing games. Haggis has received praise for being the first to successfully create a climbing, trick-taking game, designed from the start for two to three players, where most previous games required four players or more. The evenly distributed, face card "bombs" are a notable innovation for the genre, helping even out hand strength enough to make two-person play workable, and enhancing the strategic element of the game. The game's designer, Sean Ross, developed Haggis over a period of several years, with first publication in late 2010 by Indie Boards and Cards. The game was named after haggis partly in a nod to Ross' Scottish heritage, but also because the game brought together the "guts" (scoring and play mechanisms) of several other climbing games. Haggis was a nominee for "Best Card Game" in the 2010 Golden Geek Awards by BoardGameGeek. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential leg before wicket (lbw) appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit 

 Dragon Ball Z Collectible Card Game allows players to construct a sensei deck in addition to the main playing deck (known as a life deck), which requires the use of a sensei card. This is a draw game that plays much like a stud game. Now, in place of a second round and showdown, there is a rollout phase, which begins with the players arranging their five cards in any chosen order, placing them face down in front of themselves. This game can be played for high or low, but plays best at high-low split, in which case it is called "Skinny Minnie".

Question: With which game would you use a squidger, a circular disc between 25mm and 51 mm?

The Girlie Wants a Song ; Music by Milan Kymlicka, Lyrics by Gerald Potterton ; The Birthday Contest Medley ; Music by Milan Kymlicka, Lyrics by Gerald Potterton ; Happy Birthday to You ; Used by permission Warner Bros.

 The song tells of the wedding of two teenagers and their lifestyle afterward. Eventually they purchase a "souped-up jitney" (an automobile modified for high performance) and travel to New Orleans, where their wedding had taken place, to celebrate their anniversary. The piano melody was influenced by Mitchell Torok's 1953 hit "Caribbean". In 2009, music publisher Larrikin Music, then headed by Norman Lurie (now retired), sued Men at Work and their record label EMI for plagiarism, alleging that the flute riff copied the 1934 nursery rhyme "Kookaburra", to which they owned the publishing rights. A traditional song, it was orchestrated by Ken Darby in 1956 but a version (called The Keys of Canterbury) was known in the 19th century and Alan Lomax collected it as "A Paper of Pins" in the 1930s. It is best known in a recording, made on July 17, 1956, by The Four Lads and dubbed over the opening credits of the movie, with some of its lyrics also included in early dialogue. While teaching at the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School, the Hill sisters wrote the song "Good Morning to All"; Mildred wrote the melody, and Patty the lyrics. The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students. Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s, with no author identified for the new lyrics, nor credit given for the melody from "Good Morning to You". Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company, and a series of court cases (which all settled out of court), the sisters became known as the authors of "Happy Birthday to You".

 Mildred Jane Hill, born in Louisville, Kentucky, was the oldest of three sisters, Mildred, Patty, and Jessica. She learned music from her father, Calvin Cody, and Adolph Weidig. It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher, like her younger sister Patty. She moved into music, teaching, composing, performing, and specializing in the study of Negro spirituals. Hill and her sister were honored at the Chicago World's Fair (1893) for their work in the progressive education program at the experimental kindergarten, the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School. She wrote about music using the pen name Johann Tonsor, and her 1892 article "Negro Music", suggesting that the existing body of black music would be the basis of a distinctive American musical style, influenced Dvořák in composing the New World Symphony. Hill died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916, long before her song became famous. She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky.

Finally, the 27th stanza is an example of what has been called "the most complex and exquisite type of palindrome ever invented". It may also be thought of as a syllabic Sator Square. Sanskrit aestheticians call it sarvatobhadra, "perfect in every direction" — it yields the same text if read forwards, backwards, down, or up: सकारनानारकास- कायसाददसायका । रसाहवा वाहसार- नादवाददवादना ॥ sakāranānārakāsa- kāyasādadasāyakā rasāhavā vāhasāra- nādavādadavādanā. A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as "Four minus three equals one." Kaibun (回文; literally circle sentence) is a Japanese equivalent of the palindrome, or in other words, a sentence that reads the same from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning. Single word palindromes are not uncommon in Japanese. For example, Ku-ku (九九, multiplication table), Shi-n-bu-n-shi (新聞紙, newspaper), to-ma-to (トマト, tomato), etc. So kaibun usually refers to a palindromic sentence, but a passage can be a kaibun too. In classics, diacritic marks are often ignored. Rather than saying "read the same forwards and backwards", because Japanese is traditionally written vertically, Japanese people describe the word as being the same when read from the top (ue kara yomu) as when read from the bottom (shita kara yomu). An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram itself can be rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode. The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. Secondly, ambigraphic notation assists in the visualization of palindromes, which are sequences that read the same forward and backward. This is particularly relevant in genetic research, as palindromic sequences often have significant functional implications. By using this notation, researchers can easily identify and analyze palindromic regions in genetic sequences. Furthermore, ambigraphic notation utilizes common orthographic features such as stems and loops to highlight regions rich in guanine and cytosine. The term "palindrome" is often associated with a sequence of DNA. In genetics, a palindrome refers to a DNA sequence that reads the same way forward and backward.

Secondly, ambigraphic notation assists in the visualization of palindromes, which are sequences that read the same forward and backward. This is particularly relevant in genetic research, as palindromic sequences often have significant functional implications. By using this notation, researchers can easily identify and analyze palindromic regions in genetic sequences. Furthermore, ambigraphic notation utilizes common orthographic features such as stems and loops to highlight regions rich in guanine and cytosine. The term "palindrome" is often associated with a sequence of DNA. In genetics, a palindrome refers to a DNA sequence that reads the same way forward and backward.

Green is a symbol of Ireland, which is often referred to as the "Emerald Isle". The color is particularly identified with the republican and nationalist traditions in modern times. It is used this way on the flag of the Republic of Ireland, in balance with white and the Protestant orange. The change from blue to green started in the 17th century with Owen Roe O'Neill and Confederate Ireland, The colour green became associated with Ireland from the 1640s onwards. This was a common flag used to represent Ireland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It consisted of a gold cláirseach on a green background. It is the same as the modern Flag of Leinster. The red in the flag stands for the revolutionary zeal of the youth and the sky blue symbolises their desire for peace. The red star stands for revolutionary idealism and honesty and the five corners of the star represent the solidarity and friendship of the youth of all five continents. Within the canton features a Lion of Saint Mark against a background of diagonal red, white, and green stripes. Following the outbreak of revolt in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia in 1848 and the declaration of independence of the Republic of San Marco by Venetian separatists, the flag was adopted as a symbol of the new republic. Daniele Manin, President of the Republic, decreed on 21 March 1848 that the flag should come to represent the new republic following the end of Austrian rule. By including the traditional flag of the Republic of Venice, the insurrectionists simultaneously demonstrated continuity with the previous republic alongside newfound independence.

Cullen skink appears in many traditional Scottish cookery books and restaurant and hotel menus throughout Scotland, the rest of the UK and abroad. In 2012 a Guardian columnist described the dish as "the milky fish soup which has surely replaced your haggises and porridges as Scotland's signature dish". Haggis is a high-level reference programming language used primarily to examine computing science for Scottish pupils taking SQA courses on the subject. Haggis is not based on any one language but a mixture that is intended to allow a pupil familiar with any of the many languages used in classrooms to easily understand the syntactic construct being used in an example. Online Haggis interpreters have been developed to provide a way for examiners and teachers to check their programs are correctly defined and behave as expected. In Scotland, separately boiled and mashed, rutabagas (neeps) and potatoes are served as "neeps and tatties" ("tatties" being the Scots word for potatoes), in a traditional Burns supper, together with the main course of haggis (the Scottish national dish).

 Wild haggis (given the humorous taxonomic designation Haggis scoticus) is a fictional creature of Scottish folklore, said to be native to the Scottish Highlands. It is comically claimed to be the source of haggis, a traditional Scottish dish that is in fact made from the innards of sheep (including heart, lungs, and liver). According to some sources, the wild haggis's left and right legs are of different lengths (cf. It is further claimed that there are two

Approximately 91% of people test positive for Sd(a) through blood typing, and 96% test positive through urine testing. Neutrophil: Neutrophils are the most common white blood cells in normal adult blood. When stained with a Romanowsky stain, they exhibit a multi-lobed nucleus and pink cytoplasm that contains small purple granules. Monocyte: Monocytes are large cells with a curved or folded nucleus and finely granulated, grey-blue cytoplasm that often contains vacuoles. The test may be performed as part of a routine medical examination; to investigate certain symptoms, particularly those suggestive of infection or hematological disorders; or to monitor existing conditions, such as blood disorders and inflammatory diseases. Five types of white blood cells are normally found in blood: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Marked shifts in the proportions of these cell types, as measured by the automated or manual differential, can indicate various health conditions. Additionally, cell types which do not normally occur in the blood, such as blast cells, can be identified by the manual differential. These cell types may be found in blood disorders and other pathological states. The manual differential can also identify changes in the appearance of white blood cells, such 

You thought knowing your blood type was something people do for fun. From heart disease and strokes to certain types of cancer, here’s why your blood type matters. Unless you’ve recently given blood, you may not think much about your blood type. The presence or absence of certain molecules called A or B antigens, as well as a protein called the Rh factor, determine which of the eight common blood types you have coursing through your veins. However, these antigens make a difference beyond just your blood, influencing other body systems like your blood vessels, nerve cells, and blood platelets—which is why your blood type may impact your risk of certain diseases. Here’s why you should know what blood type you have. Non-O blood types have 25 to 30 percent higher levels of blood clotting proteins known as von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. Considering that type Os have lower quantities of the proteins that help blood coagulate, they’re also less likely to suffer from blood clots. “It shouldn’t be assumed that being an O blood type means an individual is ‘protected’ or an A blood type is at higher risk,” says American Society of Hematology Councillor Terry B. Gernsheimer, MD. O may be the most common blood type, but it can interfere with pregnancy. Another interesting finding from the BMC Medicine study: Non-O blood types (A, B, or AB) also had an increased risk of gastric cancers, possibly due to an inflammatory response to H. pylori bacteria, the researchers write. (The bacteria is a cause of gastric ulcers.) Though AB is the least common blood type, research suggests that people with AB are 82 percent more likely to develop cognitive issues in the future. It may be because this blood type comes along with higher levels of factor VIII, the study authors say. People with A or B blood type have up to 21 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, per Diabetologia. For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. History Discovery The ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.

From the top and from the bottom, the stripes alternate black and royal blue. The central stripe is white. The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag or the U.S. flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the "union") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S. Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory, and the Star-Spangled Banner. Columbus, the namesake of the city, is also referenced near the center of the seal, where a ship of his fleet is depicted.

 design) on a dark blue background. The city flag's dimensions of 10:19 are also related to the United States flag. Instead of directly stating the proportions, the municipal code of Columbus mandates that the flag be of the same proportions of the United States flag, which was specified to be 20 by 38 (often simplified to 10 by 19) in a 1959 executive order following the admission of Hawaii to the Union. Perched on top of the shield is an eagle with outstretched wings, yet another example of American symbolism. Behind the eagle is the dome of the Ohio State Capitol 

 The flag of the United States Space Force is the flag used to represent the United States Space Force, as well as its subsidiary units and formations. The flag is dominated by a green, elongated and rigid letter "E" upon a white background. The flag's two blue stripes symbolize the north and south branches of the Chicago River, which flows through the city's downtown. The three white stripes represent the North, West and South sides of the city, Lake Michigan being the east side.

Since the early 1900s, beekeepers in the United States started renting out their colonies to farmers to increase the farmer's crop yields, earning additional revenue from providing privatized pollination. As of 2016, 41% of an average US beekeeper's revenue comes from providing such pollination service to farmers, making it the biggest proportion of their income, with the rest coming from sales of honey, beeswax, 

 Imagine a world without bees. Accompanying information about the history, social structure and science behind the world of bees and honey are conservation activities to make the world a place where hives of bees can thrive. In bumblebees, queens are the only ones capable of producing more queens. American foulbrood, AFB, a honey bee brood bacterial infection, is often resistant to antibiotics. Many crops are in bloom, and honey bee colonies are collecting nectar and building up honey stores after travelling for pollination service. Queen bees and worker bees develop from fertilized eggs, and drone bees develop from nonfertilized eggs. Worker bees feed developing queen bees and worker bees a different diet even though they both develop from the same fertilized eggs. The larvae of both queens and workers are fed an enriched food, royal jelly, in the first day of larval development. Worker larvae are then fed secretions workers produce from “bee bread,” a food consisting of fermenting pollen and honey. Queen larvae, however, continue to receive royal jelly through their larval development and throughout their life. Beekeepers feed bees when there is a shortage of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. Modern beekeepers feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Pollen substitute is commonly fed to bees in early spring or when bees are located in a region with poor pollen resources. Feeders may exist outside the hive, be designed to fit certain hive designs, be an integral part of a hive design, or be used separately inside the hive. Feeders may attach to the side of the hive, or slot into the flight entrance, or placed above or below the nest inside the hive or as a purpose-built hive component. As a social species, Apis cerana colonies contain divisions of labor depending on what each member of the group is specialized to perform. There is generally only one queen bee whose sole responsibility it is to lay eggs; therefore, she is the mother of all the workers present in the colony. Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age. The remaining individuals are the males, known as the “drones,” whose only responsibility is to mate with queen from another colony; therefore, drones are solely produced during the reproductive season. Similar to most beehives, an M. beecheii colony has one fertile queen and numerous nonreproductive female worker bees. At around the same time that the queen begins to lay eggs that will develop into males, the workers' ovaries, those "house bees" who stay in the nest, begin to develop. Greek bees generally tend to build up very quickly in the spring, with the queens being very prolific, resulting in strong hives. They also tend to make quite a lot of honey, but only in Mediterranean climates.

2024-06-14 14:55:38 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: Common amongst eusocial bees, females make up the worker and queen populations. Since the early 1900s, beekeepers in the United States started renting out their colonies to farmers to increase the farmer's crop yields, earning additional revenue from providing privatized pollination. As of 2016, 41% of an average US beekeeper's revenue comes from providing such pollination service to farmers, making it the biggest proportion of their income, with the rest coming from sales of honey, beeswax,

 In 1929, Karslidis settled in the village of Taxiarches (Sipsa), in Drama, Northern Greece, where he lived the remaining thirty years of his life. In 1936 Karslidis managed to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, visiting the sites of Christ's life, and visiting various monasteries and hermitages. Karslidis foresaw the coming of World War II as well as the Greek Civil War that would follow it. He was sentenced to death for the second time in his life in 1941 by Bulgarian forces, but after he prayed with calmness and asked them to proceed with their work, they abandoned him out of fear and ran away; thus once again he survived miraculously. Karslidis died a few hours after midnight on November 4, 1959, and was buried behind the Katholikon of the Monastery of the Ascension. Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (r. 1042–1055) died after contracting pleurisy while bathing in the pond at the monastery of Saint George in January 1055. He was ultimately buried at the monastery. Years later, the palace that Emperor Monomachos built at Mangana was destroyed by Emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185–1195 and 1203–1204), but the monastery complex of Saint George survived until the fall of Constantinople in May 1453. Since its construction, the Byzantine imperial court made annual visits to the monastery on April 23, which was the feast day of Saint George. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred.

  Scotland has produced many great snooker players over the years, many of which have gone on to win the World Championship. In the modern snooker era the most successful Scottish snooker player is Stephen Hendry. He has won the World Snooker Championship a record 7 times, winning it 5 years in a row from 1992 onwards and holds the record as being the youngest ever winner, beating Englishman Jimmy White 18 frames to 12 in 1990 aged just 21 years. As well as Hendry's record 7 wins, John Higgins and Graeme Dott have also won the title. In 1996, the Scotland Team of Stephen Hendry, John Higgins and Alan McManus won the Snooker World Cup. Only Davis, Hendry and Williams have won all three Triple Crown events in the same season. Hendry is the only player to achieve the feat twice, in the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons. After winning the 1999 Masters, John Higgins held all three Triple Crown titles at the same time but his victories spanned two seasons. Only O'Sullivan and Hendry have managed to successfully defend all three Triple Crown events. In 2013, Robertson became the first player from outside the United Kingdom to complete the career Triple Crown. Following his win in the 2018 UK Championship, O'Sullivan surpassed Hendry's previous record of 18 and now has won 20 Triple Crown titles. In the 1993–94 season, O'Sullivan enjoyed more success by first qualifying for the Masters as a wild card by winning the 1993 Benson and Hedges Snooker Championship by defeating John Lardner 9–6 in the final. Making his debut at the Masters, he lost in the first round 1–5 to Dennis Taylor, who was the Masters champion in 1987, by defeating Alex Higgins 9–8 in the final. Of the eighteen players to have won their first world title at the Crucible Theatre, six lost in their first match as defending champion: Terry Griffiths in 1980, Steve Davis in 1982, Dennis Taylor in 1986, Graeme Dott in 2007, Neil Robertson in 2011, and Stuart Bingham in 2016. Most recently, Judd Trump fell to the curse at the quarter-final stage. Only two of the eighteen were able to reach the final as defending champions: Joe Johnson in 1987 and Ken Doherty in 1998. Four players have won consecutive world titles at the Crucible (having already won the championship previously): Steve Davis (1983–1984 and 1987–1989), Stephen Hendry (1992–1996), Ronnie O'Sullivan (2012–2013), and Mark Selby (2016–2017).

 The title of "World's Greatest Athlete" traditionally belongs to the world's top competitor in the decathlon (males) and heptathlon (females) in track and field. The decathlon consists of 10 events: 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m. The heptathlon consists of seven events: the 100 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters. That title has been associated with the decathlon event ever since. Firstly, he demonstrates great endurance and stamina, as these competitions require participants to complete challenging courses that include swimming, cycling, and running. These athletes must possess the mental resilience to push through fatigue, discomfort, and mental barriers that may arise during the race. Furthermore, successful male athletes in these competitions often have a well-rounded skill set across all three disciplines of swimming, cycling, and running. While they might excel in one particular area, such as cycling, they are also proficient in the others, allowing them to perform consistently across the entire race. Proper training, nutrition, and recovery are also important factors. Male athletes who excel in triathlon or Ironman competitions have a comprehensive training program that includes specific workouts for each discipline, as well as cross-training activities to enhance overall physical fitness. These athletes are not only physically talented, but also possess the mental acuity to make split-second decisions that can impact their overall performance. In conclusion, a male athlete who excels in triathlon or Ironman competitions typically demonstrates exceptional endurance, mental toughness, well-rounded skills across all disciplines, proper training and recovery practices, as well as a competitive and strategic mindset. The first world record in the decathlon was recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1922. The current world record holder in the decathlon is French national Kevin Mayer.

Nadal would also beat Federer in five sets at the 2009 Australian Open, and Federer would beat Nadal in five sets in the final of the 2017 Australian Open.

Due to this potential Borg returned to the All England Club for the first time in many years to witness the Wimbledon final.

 Ronald McKenzie is a New Zealand professional male tennis player who reached the final of ATP Auckland Open in 1960, where he lost to Roy Emerson 6–3, 6–1, 6–1. In 1940, he was the New Zealand Junior tennis champion, but his tennis career was then interrupted by World War II. McKenzie, John Barry and Jeff Robson formed the 1947 New Zealand Davis Cup team, and they travelled to Europe by container ship. Their training on the deck of the freighter came to an end when they lost all their tennis balls overboard. The team was arrested during the journey as there were problems with their documentation. One of McKenzie's more notable appearances resulted on this journey when he turned around a 2 nil lead by Norway into a 3 to 2 win by his team in the 1947 Davis Cup. McKenzie was New Zealand's best player in the 1950s. It was the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, and was later recognised as the first Grand Slam tournament or "Major". In June 1877 the club decided to organise a tennis tournament to pay for the repair of its pony roller, needed to maintain the lawns.

 Brendan H. Macken (21 January 1923 – 12 March 2020) was a Canadian National tennis champion and Davis Cup player. Originally from Montreal, Macken won the precursor to today's Roger Cups, the 1950 Canadian National championship, in singles, by defeating Henri Rochon in the final, 6-0, 6-0, 6-3. Despite this convincing scoreline, it was his only Canadian championship singles title. He also won the doubles crown twice - in 1946 with his brother Jim and in 1951 partnering Lorne Main.

 Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have a storied rivalry that many consider to be the greatest in tennis history. He won the acclaimed tennis crown, after winning 3 of 5 sets against Australian John Bromwich. Bromwich had a match point at 5–3 in the fifth set, but Falkenburg saved three match points and went on to win 7–5 in the fifth set. Similar to the situation with Edberg in 1990, the ITF cited Nadal's failure to win a match at 2 of the 4 slams (DNP the Australian Open, 1st round loss at Wimbledon) to justify their decision and Djokovic's consistent results across all four Slams (1 title, 2 runner-ups, 1 SF), Davis Cup (led Serbia to final, won 7/7 singles rubbers) and the ATP World Tour Finals (won title). None of these, however, were controversial and were generally agreed upon, with the 1978 and 1982 choices being particularly clear cut in favor of Borg (1978) and Connors (1982). The performances of Britons Andy Murray in the men's singles and Laura Robson in the girls' singles were able to arouse significant interest from the home crowd.

Here van Gogh primarily captures the respite and relief from city life found in nature. A few of the paintings were made in Paris and the rest in the northwestern suburbs of Paris in Clichy and Asnières. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as cousin-in-law Anton Mauve a Dutch realist painter who was a leading member of the Hague School. In Paris van Gogh was exposed to and influenced by Impressionism, Symbolism, Pointillism, and Japanese woodblock print genres which were overtime integrated into his works. The spring of 1887 seemed to trigger an awakening within van Gogh where he experimented with the genres to develop his personal style. Van Gogh was about 35 years of age when he moved to Arles in southern France. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as Harvest at La Crau. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This was also likely one of Van Gogh's happier periods of life. His work during this period represents a culmination of influences, such as Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism and Japanese art (see Japonism) from his period in Paris the prior two years. Vincent van Gogh is an 1886 oil on canvas portrait painting by Australian artist John Russell. It depicts Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, who befriended Russell after meeting him at Fernand Cormon's atelier in Paris, which they both attended. It is the earliest of three portraits painted of Van Gogh from life by his contemporaries, the other two being Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's Portrait of Vincent van Gogh (1887) and Paul Gauguin's The Painter of Sunflowers (1888). The painting passed from Van Gogh to his brother Theo, then to their family, and is now in the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. In the Netherlands van Gogh was influenced by great Dutch masters as well as his cousin-in-law Anton Mauve, a Dutch realist painter and leading member of the Hague School, who had a significant early impact on Vincent van Gogh. To dull colors, van Gogh often added black to his paintings. There is no consensus on Vincent van Gogh's health. Symptoms and characteristics Various symptoms are described in van Gogh's letters and other documents such as the asylum register at Saint-Rémy. Van Gogh suffered from some sort of seizures or crises, and in one of these attacks, on December 23, 1888, he cut off a part, or possibly all, of his ear. One of the most frequent complaints in Van Gogh's letters is the problems he endured with his stomach and poor digestion. Van Gogh suffered from hallucinations and nightmares at times. Van Gogh reported his impotence to Theo, his brother, in the summer after he arrived in Arles, and a month later when he wrote to Bernard it seemed to still be very much on his mind. Behavior Many analysts, such as American psychiatrist Dietrich Blumer, agree that one of the things Vincent van Gogh suffered from was bipolar disorder. From a young age, van Gogh grew up with a strong connection to painting and religion.

The memorial is the second of two that have been constructed in Washington to commemorate that president. Dedicated on May 2, 1997 by President Bill Clinton, the national memorial, spread over 7.5 acre adjacent to the southwest side of the Tidal Basin along the Cherry Tree Walk in West Potomac Park, traces 12 years of the history of the United States through a sequence of four outdoor rooms, one for each of FDR's terms of office.

  The first public memorial to United States President Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., was a statue by Lot Flannery erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after Lincoln's assassination. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, Clark Mills, was chosen to design the monument. Funds for the monument were raised in the 

 American composer Michael Daugherty's 2010 piece for chorus and orchestra, "Mount Rushmore," depicts each of the four presidents in separate movements. The piece sets texts by George Washington, William Billings, Thomas Jefferson, Maria Cosway, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Alice Cooper references Mount Rushmore in his album DaDa on the song "I love America" with the words, "I love that mountain with those four big heads." Adam Young composed a score in based on the shrine called "Mount Rushmore." The Lincoln Memorial is a US national memorial built to honor the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. It is on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument, and is in the form of a neoclassical temple. The designer of the memorial interior's large central statue, Abraham Lincoln (1920), was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli brothers. Dedicated in May 

 Built in 1827, the original tower was the first monument dedicated to George Washington to be completed. Former President Trump has been known to share an affinity with Mount Rushmore, even telling South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem that it is a dream of his to have his own face carved onto the monument. A portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on Mount Rushmore, which receives about 3 million visitors a year. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on Mount Rushmore – George Washington ("George"), Thomas Jefferson ("Tom"), Abraham Lincoln ("Abe"), and Theodore Roosevelt ("Teddy") – have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant – William Howard Taft ("Bill") – was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the White House Historical Association, with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. Herbert Hoover ("Herbie") replaced Coolidge for 2016. The original bust was sculpted by French sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon in 1785 at George Washington's home, Mount Vernon, in Virginia. It is believed that Washington posed for the original sculpture.

 Rice vinegar is a vinegar made from fermented rice in East Asia (China, Japan and Korea), as well as in Vietnam in Southeast Asia. It is made from either rice or sake lees. These vinegars are used in making sunomono (酢の物, "vinegar dishes"), tsukemono (漬物, "pickles"), nimono (煮物, "simmered dishes"), as well as in marinades to mitigate the stronger odors of certain fishes and meats. Seasoned rice vinegar (合わせ酢 awasezu) is made by adding sake, salt and sugar. In the culinary arts, vinegar is primarily used as a flavorful and acidic cooking ingredient. It adds tanginess and brightness to dishes and can be used in marinades, dressings, sauces, and soups. Vinegar is also commonly used in pickling vegetables or fruits, as its acidity helps preserve them. There are various types of vinegar available, depending on the source materials used during production. Balsamic vinegar, for example, is made from grape must and is known for its rich flavor and syrupy consistency. Malt vinegar is made from malted barley and has a distinctive malty taste. Overall, vinegar's versatility makes it a valuable ingredient both in cooking and various industrial settings. White rice vinegar is a colorless to pale yellow liquid, higher in acetic acid than other Chinese vinegars, but still less acidic and milder in flavor than Western vinegars.

You must have heard the buzz about Apple cider vinegar? What exactly is the chemical composition of Apple cider vinegar? Apple cider vinegar is the fermented juice of crushed apples. Being made from apples it contains pectin and potassium, which promotes cell and tissue growth. The typical Western diet creates an acidic pH in our bodies and many health problems are attributed to this. The term "wine" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. The finest wine was reserved for the upper classes of Rome. Below that was posca, a mixture of water and sour wine that had not yet turned into vinegar.

One of the most vital minerals for detoxifying the body is potassium, and there is no better source than raw apple cider vinegar.Only vinegar with the "mother" can be used as medicine because it has beneficial minerals (especially potassium), malic and tartaric acids, and enzymes intact.Raw vinegars have been used to cure ailments for centuries, not only for specific medical problems, but also to improve one's health, to detoxify the body, and to treat a wide range of diseases related to toxins and acidity. In Asia, vinegar is often called "the best friend of Chinese herbs" because it is frequently used to process herbal preparations. The historical origins of vinegar are not exactly known; it was probably discovered when our ancestors saw that wine exposed to the air turned sour, thereby creating vinegar. The process of creating this raw apple cider vinegar involves fermenting apple juice to wine or cider, which is then allowed to ferment a second time until the alcohol mixes with oxygen in the air, changing it into acetic acid and water. Apple cider vinegar is often called one of Mother Nature's perfect foods, so it seems fitting that medicinal apple cider vinegar must contain the "mother," a term that refers to the milky sediment at the bottom of the bottle, which should not be confused with commercially made (nonmilky) processed apple cider vinegar, which is only good for taste, pickling, and cleaning. Chinese rice vinegars are stronger than Japanese ones, and range in color from clear to various shades of red, brown and black and are therefore known as rice wine vinegars. Chinese and especially Japanese vinegars are less acidic than the distilled Western vinegars which, for that reason, are not appropriate substitutes for rice vinegars. Chinese rice vinegars are made from huangjiu, a type of rice wine. Yogurt and cheese are produced using the milk-souring bacterial genus Lactobacillus, which ferments the milk and gives it its characteristic taste and texture. In the case of vinegar production, bacteria are involved in the process of fermenting alcohol, usually derived from grapes or apples, into acetic acid. These bacteria convert the alcohol into acetic acid through a two-step fermentation process, resulting in the sour taste of vinegar. In summary, bacteria play a vital role in the production of traditional foods like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Their fermentation abilities contribute to the distinct flavors and textures of these products.

Notes The OFC Nations Cup has often acted as part of the FIFA World Cup qualification process for Oceanian national teams and, as a result, American Samoa have competed in the qualifiers for both competitions in every edition since 1998. They have yet to qualify for either competition. Lui was in charge of American Samoa in the 31–0 loss against Australia in a qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup. The American Samoa national team was then without a coach for two years before the appointment of Ian Crook in 2003. The U.S. defeated Uruguay 42–13 in the first match and 26–7 in the second to send them through to the Rugby World Cup. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the U.S. joined England, Samoa, South Africa and Tonga in Pool A. The Eagles, ranked 13th in the world standings, lost all 4 games in Pool A, scoring 1 bonus point in the game against Samoa. The U.S. was then beaten by Tonga 25–15, 

 American Samoa is one of the weakest teams in the world, due to both its small population base and the overwhelming popularity of American football, basketball and baseball in the islands. In fact, it holds the distinction of suffering the largest loss in international football history, having been defeated by Australia 31–0 on April 11, 2001. As of December 2010 according to the FIFA World Rankings, American Samoa are ranked 203rd, or joint last, in the world of FIFA-sanctioned, international football. In November 2011, American Samoa defeated Tonga 2–1 in the first round of OFC World Cup Qualification to record their second international victory after 38 consecutive defeats. Lomu's 1999 international season kicked off with a warm-up match against New Zealand A, which was followed by a game against Samoa in which Lomu scored one of the All Blacks' nine tries. As New Zealand and Australia had already qualified for the World Cup, Samoa and Fiji met in the playoff match with the winner gaining qualification to the World Cup and the loser to play against the winner of a match between Tonga and Papua New Guinea to earn a place in the repechage tournament. As a result, Fiji qualified for the World Cup, while Samoa awaited the winner of Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Tonga played Samoa to determine who advanced to the repechage tournament.

Question: Which team beat American Samoa 31-0 in a qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup, but still failed to qualify?
Answer: 
2024-06-14 14:55:50 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:American Samoa have only won against Cook Islands and Tonga. Notes The OFC Nations Cup has often acted as part of the FIFA World Cup qualification process for Oceanian national teams and, as a result, American Samoa have competed in the qualifiers for both competitions in every edition since 1998. They have yet to qualify for either competition. Lui was in charge of American Samoa in the 31–0 loss against Australia in a qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup. The American Samoa national team was then without a coach for two years before the appointment of Ian Crook in 2003. The U.S. defeated Uruguay 42–13 in the first match and 26–7 in the second to send them through to the Rugby World Cup. In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the U.S. joined England, Samoa, South Africa and Tonga in Pool A. The Eagles, ranked 13th in the world standings, lost all 4 games in Pool A, scoring 1 bonus point in the game against Samoa. The U.S. was then beaten by Tonga 25–15, 

 American Samoa is one of the weakest teams in the world, due to both its small population base and the overwhelming popularity of American football, basketball and baseball in the islands. In fact, it holds the distinction of suffering the largest loss in international football history, having been defeated by Australia 31–0 on April 11, 2001.

The gestation period varies depending on climate, lasting 2–3 months in tropical areas, while lasting up to 5 months in temperate climates. At birth, this species weighs about 50% of the mother’s weight. The females fly, carrying their young, between roosts to keep them safe from predators. Females give birth to litters containing two to five young around early spring. Mating takes place in short periods throughout the rainy season in December. Afterwards, both males and females go their separate ways and return to their solitary lives once more. Young are raised solely by the females. Gestation lasts around two months (63 days).

 Gestation lasts roughly six months, ending in parturition, which normally occurs during June or July. Typically, females give birth to one or two young. The newborns weigh about 500 g, and have spots. The young are cared for by their mother after birth for several months, until weaning occurs. At six months, the young have typically reached full adult size. Sexual maturity, however, does not occur until roughly 18 months. Not much is known about black musk deer parental care. Females are generally the main caretakers, as they watch their young for roughly 3 to 4 months. Typically, the young travel with their mothers throughout this period, during which the mother defends and grooms her young. Abnormalities may cause calving problems. Occasionally, a difficult calving is caused by a skeletal defect in the fetus. Vulnerability varies at different stages of gestation. Vulnerability varies at different stages of gestation. Many of these are simple recessives; the defective gene must come from both sire and dam in order for the defect to show up in the calf. In calves with arthrogryposis multiplex (AM, or curly calf syndrome), legs are crooked and twisted in different directions.

Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls. After arrival on shore, males fast for three months, and females fast for five weeks during mating and when nursing their pups. The gestation period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females.

Pregnancy, also known as gestation, is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman's womb. This is just over nine months (gestational age). When using fertilization age, the length is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following fertilization (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age), after which the term fetus is used until birth. The first trimester includes conception, which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the Fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care, though babies born at this time will likely experience serious health complications such as heart and respiratory problems and long-term intellectual and developmental disabilities. Babies born before 37 weeks are "preterm" and at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy. Babies born between weeks 37 and 39 are considered "early term" while those born between weeks 39 and 41 are considered "full term".

In some areas, the presence of certain species (such as beavers) can be beneficial for flood control reasons. Beavers build and maintain beaver dams which will reduce the height of flood waves moving down the river (during periods of heavy rains), and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures, at the cost of minor flooding near the dams (often on farmland). Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis' satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Dams impound water and lodges serve as shelters. Their infrastructure creates wetlands used by many other species, and because of their effect on other organisms in the ecosystem, they are considered a keystone species.

 An ecosystem engineer is a species that maintains, modifies and creates aspects of a community. Dam building beavers are ecological engineers. Beavers live in freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. Water is the most important part of the beaver habitat. Beavers prefer to use slower moving streams, typically with a gradient or steepness of one percent, though they have been recorded using streams with gradients as high as 15 percent. Beavers also prefer wider streams over narrower ones. Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. Beavers in some areas will dig canals connected to their ponds. It has been hypothesized that beavers' canals are not only transportation routes but an extension of their "central place" around the lodge and/or food cache. Beavers create trails or "slides" as they drag wood, which then make it easier for the animals to transport new material. Some muskrat push-ups are swept away in spring floods and have to be replaced each year. Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife

Wallaroos are typically distinct species from kangaroos and wallabies. An exception is the antilopine wallaroo, which is commonly known as an antilopine kangaroo when large, an antilopine wallaby (when small), or an antilopine wallaroo when of intermediate size. The males compete for females during the breeding season. The gestation period is 30–31 days, after which the incompletely developed fetus (referred to as a joey) attaches to the teat in the pouch for 130–150 days. Females sexually mature at 17 months while males mature at around 20 months. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild.

The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first 2–4 weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother. As a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. The majority of the young are born between May and July. The average litter is two, although there are very occasionally triplets. As with other marsupials, the common ringtail possum's 

 In the early 2000s, while working as a tour guide running tours between Alice Springs and Uluru, Barns came across a joey, still in its dead mother's pouch, near Curtin Springs.

In 2017, it was among many other holiday songs (such as "Driving Home for Christmas" and "Step into Christmas") 

 A year-end Christmas show featuring a review of the year's biggest hits was inaugurated on 24 December 1964, and has continued every year since. In 1975, the first of the two shows was broadcast prior to Christmas Day, airing on 23 December, followed by the traditional Christmas 

 In December 1965, The Beatles became the first act to secure three consecutive Christmas number-one singles in the UK chart when "Day Tripper"/"We Can Work It Out" topped the chart for five consecutive weeks. The group's two previous Christmas chart-toppers were 1963's "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and 1964's "I Feel Fine".

The Beatles would secure a fourth Christmas number-one single in 1967 with "Hello Goodbye". As of 2021, The Beatles remain the act with the most Christmas number-one singles in the United Kingdom. The song was the odds-on favourite with the bookmakers to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart, but was beaten by the relatively unknown Gary Jules and Michael Andrews with a cover of Tears for Fears' "Mad World", and thus the band had to settle for the number two position, joining a list of acts including Wham!, The Pogues, Mariah Carey and Cliff Richard to miss out on the top spot (though Cliff did make number one with differing releases too). The Beatles, The Dave Clark Five, Dusty Springfield, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1963. The 1962 Christmas number-one, "Return to Sender" by Elvis Presley, remained at number one for the first week of 1963.

The song can be traced only as far as the early nineteenth century, but the lyrics reflect an association between holly and Christmas dating at least as far as medieval times. The version which is now popular was collected in 1909 by the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp in the market town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, from a woman named Mary Clayton. Milton for Christmas Day. The words of the carol were included in Sylvester's 1861 collection A Garland of Christmas Carols where it is claimed to originate from "an old broadside, printed a century and a half since" [i.e. around 1711]: Husk's 1864 Songs of the Nativity also includes the carol, stating: "This carol appears to have nearly escaped the notice of collectors, as it has been reprinted by one alone, who states his copy to have been taken from "an old broadside, printed a century and a half since," i.e. An early mention of the carol's title occurs in William Hone's 1823 work Ancient Mysteries Described, which includes "The holly and the ivy, now are both well grown" among an alphabetical list of "Christmas Carols, now annually printed" that were in the author's possession. The complete words of the carol are found in a book review dating from 1849, in which the reviewer suggested using the text of "The Holly and the Ivy" in place of one of the readings found in the book under discussion. Henry VIII wrote a love song Green Groweth the Holly which alludes to holly and ivy resisting winter blasts and not changing their green hue So I am and ever hath been Unto my lady true. Hone's 1823 Ancient Mysteries Described, which lists the carol's title as mentioned above, also describes (p 94) a British Museum manuscript: ''The same volume contains a song on the Holly and the Ivy which I mention because there is an old Carol on the same subject still printed. The MS begins with'',  <poem style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, my nay, hyt shal not be I wys, Let holy hafe the maystry, as the maner ys: Holy stond in the hall, faire to

Nay, my nay etc "The Holly and the Ivy" is also related to an older carol described by Sharp as: "The Contest of the Ivy and the Holly", a contest between the traditional emblems of woman and man respectively. <poem style="margin-left: 2em;">Holly stands in the hall, fair to behold: Ivy stands without the door, she is full sore a cold.

 The words have traditionally been sung to countless folk melodies, including three further tunes having been collected in Gloucestershire alone. Some traditional recordings have been made which demonstrate this melodic variety; these include one sung by Peter Jones of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, and another performed by Bessie Wallace of Camborne, Cornwall in the early 1930s and recorded by James Madison Carpenter, which is publicly available on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. The "Sans Day Carol", considered a variant of the song, is associated with a different tune. The early nineteenth-century sources do not provide music for the carol. Several late nineteenth-century collections set the words to "old French carol" in D minor. Holly & Ivy is a 1994 Christmas album and 16th overall studio album by American singer Natalie Cole. Released on October 4, 1994 by Elektra, it is Cole's first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to Take a Look (1993). Holly & Ivy consists of 12 tracks, including 11 covers of Christmas standards and carols and one original song written by Gerry Goffin and Michael Masser. Holly & Ivy spawned one single "No More Blue Christmas". Holly, especially the variety found in Europe, is commonly referenced at Christmas time, and is often referred to by the name Christ's thorn. Combined with the fact that holly maintains its bright colors during the Christmas season, it naturally came to be associated with the Christian holiday."

Written by George Harrison, it was the last new track recorded by the band before their break-up in April 1970. The song originated from their January 1969 rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios when they were considering making a return to live performance. Written at a time of acrimony within the group, the lyrics lament humankind's propensity for self-centredness and serve as a comment on the discord that led to Harrison temporarily leaving the Beatles.

 "Instant Karma!" The lyric focuses on a concept in which the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. The single was credited to "Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band", apart from in the US, where the credit was "John Ono Lennon". The song reached the top five in the British and American singles charts, competing with the Beatles' "Let It Be" in the US, where it became the first solo single by a member of the band to sell a million 

 Atwood columnist Russ Finney notes The Same Noise represents "a refinement of what the band did well on its previous extended play," adding "what sticks out about the latest EP is the way in which the humor and distinct personality conveyed lyrically not only anchor, but also manage to reinvigorate, the tropes of surf-punkish music." The Deli editor Olivia Sisinni describes the song "Through Being Hip" as an "upbeat anthem set against the millenial malaise[;] the ironic lyrics are supported by catchy instrumentals with surf rock drumbeats, that have the potential to become our next earworm." The song is also called a "quirky, catchy jam that clocks in at barely over two minutes but packs major attitude, the breezy, power-pop combo of guitar and drums mixing with the slightly snarky punch of lead vocals" by Elmore. "I Want to Tell You" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1966 album Revolver. After "Taxman" and "Love You To", it was the third Harrison composition recorded for Revolver. The lyrics address what he later termed "the avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit". In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties 

 The lyric concerns a man's entreaties to his girlfriend's young siblings not to reveal his courtship of their elder sister and to leave them alone, at some points, even bribing them with things like "candy and a quarter" and "a movie", on the condition that they "keep a secret". As such, it was a departure from the traditional love songs previously recorded by Kramer (sometimes supplied by Lennon & McCartney). set a romantic tone on the verses". "Easier" is a synth-heavy new wave song, released as the album's lead single, with conversational tone and "mellow" electro instrumentation. The album concludes with the slow-burner "Lonely Heart" and the self-reflective "High", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a "calm end" to the album. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, "I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me." The chorus borrows lyrically from the Beatles' song, "Revolution." Eventually they purchase a "souped-up jitney" (an automobile modified for high performance) and travel to New Orleans, where their wedding had taken place, to celebrate their anniversary. Each verse ends with the refrain, "'C'est la vie,' say the old folks, 'it goes to show you never can tell.'" The piano melody was influenced by Mitchell Torok's 1953 hit "Caribbean".

 however, he praised Churchill's sense of humour, his vitality, his loyalty and greatest of all his oratory – "a tower of debating strength in the House of Commons". The announcement of the Community Charge (often referred to as the Poll Tax) during 1989 and the onset of a recession shortly before Thatcher's resignation had seen Tory support plunge in the opinion polls, most of which were showing a double-digit Labour lead and making it seem likely that Neil Kinnock would be the next Prime Minister. Conservative MPs elected Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major as their new leader on 27 November 1990, and he was invited by the Queen to form a majority government the following day. Leonard James Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, (27 March 1912 – 26 March 2005), commonly known as Jim Callaghan, was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1976 to 1979 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1976 to 1980.

There were differences within the Cabinet over Thatcher's perceived intransigence in her approach to the European Economic Community. In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Chancellor Nigel Lawson forced Thatcher to agree to the "Madrid Conditions", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM "when the time was right".

 however, he praised Churchill's sense of humour, his vitality, his loyalty and greatest of all his oratory – "a tower of debating strength in the House of Commons". The announcement of the Community Charge (often referred to as the Poll Tax) during 1989 and the onset of a recession shortly before Thatcher's resignation had seen Tory support plunge in the opinion polls, most of which were showing a double-digit Labour lead and making it seem likely that Neil Kinnock would be the next Prime Minister. Conservative MPs elected Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major as their new leader on 27 November 1990, and he was invited by the Queen to form a majority government the following day. Leonard James Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, (27 March 1912 – 26 March 2005), commonly known as Jim Callaghan, was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1976 to 1979 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1976 to 1980. Callaghan is the only person to have held all four Great Offices of State, having served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1964 to 1967, Home Secretary from 1967 to 1970 and Foreign Secretary from 1974 to 1976. Born into a working class family in Portsmouth, Callaghan left school early and began his career as a 

 In Parliament, Hogg served as a member of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Select committee from 1979, until his appointment as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Leon Brittan in 1982. Hogg was moved in 1990 under the leadership of Prime Minister John Major to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, becoming a member of the Privy Council in 1992. There were differences within the Cabinet over Thatcher's perceived intransigence in her approach to the European Economic Community. In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Chancellor Nigel Lawson forced Thatcher to agree to the "Madrid Conditions", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM "when the time was right". In July 1989, she retaliated by removing Howe from the Foreign Office, while making him Deputy Prime Minister (in theory a promotion but in 

 that the salary "shall be reduced by the amount of the salary payable to him otherwise than out of moneys so provided in respect of his office". This applied in the case of Alan Milburn, who was given the title by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2004 and at the same time rejoined the Cabinet.

Question: During Margaret Thatcher's years as Prime Minister, there were three Chancellors of the Exchequer. Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson were two, but who was the other one?

The 

 species, indicating the recent divergence of these species. Many species are having edible fruits. Others swallow the fruit and pass the seed intact through the gut. An incomplete list of birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diet include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan. The fruits are an important food source for Palaeognathae highly dependent. Seed dispersal of various species in the genus is also carried out by fishes and big and small mammals as Pachyderms, Bovids, monkeys, arboreal rodents, porcupines, or possums. Red fruit bats are frugivores. They primarily feed on fruit like Cecropia schrebriana, Manilkara bidentata, and Prestoea montana. Flying foxes, also known as Pteropus spp., are megabats with a brain structure similar to that of primates and flying lemurs. They have keen eyesight and roost in trees instead of caves or houses. Male flying foxes sing during courtship, while females have single babies and nurse them at their breasts. This mutualistic relationship between flying foxes and plants benefits both parties. As they feed on nectar, flying foxes transfer pollen from the male part (stamen) of one flower to the female part (pistil) of another flower, facilitating cross-pollination. This process is crucial for the reproduction of many flowering plant species. Additionally, flying foxes play a key role in seed dispersal. When they consume fruit, they often drop or excrete the seeds in different locations, allowing plants to colonize new areas and maintain genetic diversity. It's worth noting that flying foxes carry various viruses, including Hendra, Nipah, SARS, Ebola, and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers. This underscores the complex relationship between flying foxes, their viruses, and human health. In some regions, like Guam, there have been concerns about the concentration of neurotoxins from the fruit of the palm-like cycad Cycas micronesica in flying foxes. The Chamorro people of Guam, who consume these bats cooked in coconut milk, have experienced high rates of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or Lou Gehrig's disease. Researchers have suggested that the neurotoxin from the cycad fruit may be contributing to the prevalence of ALS in this population. Firstly, they play a crucial role in controlling insects. Additionally, bats contribute to the reseeding of forests. This helps in the regeneration of forests and the growth of diverse plant populations. Bats also play a significant role in pollination. They transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing for the reproduction of numerous plant species, including economically important ones like bananas, mangoes, and agave (used for tequila production). It is used as a natural fertilizer in agriculture due to its rich nutrient content. Guano has been used for centuries to enhance soil fertility and agricultural productivity. It is important to note that while bats offer these benefits, they are also associated with the transmission of zoonotic diseases. In summary, bats provide essential ecosystem services, including insect control, forest reseeding, and plant pollination. Their guano is a valuable resource with various applications. This model states that fruit bats and primates share several anatomical features not seen in microbats, and are thus more closely related; for example, their brains show a number of advanced characteristics that link them to primates. Red fruit bats can range from tan to dark brown in color and their wings can be dark brown to black with red or pinked colored arms and figures. The nose-leaf are erect and shaped like a lace with a tan coloration. The ears pointed and go from light to dark brown, starting from the base of the ear and to the top of the ears. The eyes are small and oval shaped with brown iris and a circular pupils. They are highly diverse and can be found in various sizes and shapes. They include familiar organisms such as crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and krill. Bats host a diverse array of viruses, including all seven types described by the Baltimore classification system: (I) double-stranded DNA viruses; (II) single-stranded DNA viruses; (III) double-stranded RNA viruses; (IV) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (V) negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses; (VI) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate; and (VII) double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate. These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups.

Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development. Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings.

 Temperature has a notable effect on animals, contributing to body growth and size, and behavioral and physical adaptations. Ways that animals can control their body temperature include generating heat through daily activity and cooling down through prolonged inactivity at night. Placental mammals have several unique characteristics that set them apart from other vertebrates. One distinguishing feature is the presence of mammary glands, which are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk. Another unique characteristic of placental mammals is the presence of hair or fur, which helps protect them against extreme cold. Unlike other vertebrates, placental mammals have a lower jaw consisting of only a single bone on each side. Additionally, placental mammals are warm-blooded (endothermic) and have specialized or differentiated teeth. They possess a larger brain, particularly the neocortex, which is the most advanced brain area. Placental mammals also have a diaphragm, a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity, and an efficient four-chambered heart. It is worth noting that humans, as primates, are classified as placental mammals. These unique characteristics collectively contribute to the successful adaptation and diversity of placental mammals. Most mammals develop similarly to Homo sapiens; during the earliest stages of development, the embryo is largely indistinguishable from another mammal. However, there are phenomena found in human beings not found in all other mammals, as well as phenomena occurring in other mammals, but not in humans. When it comes to sex, mammals use chemical signals (pheromones) to convey information to one another. Mammal's pheromones are air-borne chemical substances released in the urine or feces of animals or secreted from sweat glands that are perceived by the olfactory system and that elicit both behavioral and endocrine responses in conspecifics. Mammals use sex pheromones to arouse, attract, and elicit specific behavioral responses from the opposite sex. In mammals, chemical signals and the scent glands that secrete them have many features in common, for example, expression in only one sex, development only in adults, often only secreted in breeding season and used exclusively in mating. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796).The first true mammals made their appearance some 200 million years ago and, over the course of tens of millions of years, diverged into three branches: The monotremes are egg-laying mammals, such as the duckbilled platypus, found only in Australia and New Guinea. Ninety percent of all mammals are placental (eutherians), in which the fetus is carried in the womb until birth at which time it is at an advanced stage of development. Humans are placental mammals classified as **primates**. Mammals have a number of unique characteristics not shared by other vertebrates: Mammary glands are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk, the offspring's primary source of nutrition. (In 1758, Linnaeus named these animals _mammals_ , from the Latin = "breast.") Hair or fur, present at some time during life, protects mammals against extreme cold. Other characteristics, although not necessarily unique to mammals, include being warm-blooded (endothermic) and having specialized or differentiated teeth, a larger brain (in particular, the neocortex, the most advanced brain area), a diaphragm (a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity), and an efficient four-chambered heart. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796). Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. In most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility (in humans, lactational amenorrhea), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring.

Other characteristics, although not necessarily unique to mammals, include being warm-blooded (endothermic) and having specialized or differentiated teeth, a larger brain (in particular, the neocortex, the most advanced brain area), a diaphragm (a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity), and an efficient four-chambered heart. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796). Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. In most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility (in humans, lactational amenorrhea), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring.

Green tea has its roots in China, and it is obtained from the leaves of Camellia sinensis. Various ancient books speak volumes about the benefits of green tea, The Kissa Yojoki (Book of Tea) written by a Zen Priest describes how green tea has positive effects on the five vital organs. There are over 450 organic substances in this tea. The EGCG polyphenols in green tea inhibit an enzyme required for cancer cell growth and even kills cancer cells without harming the healthy cells. The antioxidants present in green tea neutralizes free radicals and protects the cells. The tannins in green tea boost your immunity levels and provide protection against environmental toxins such as cigarette smoke and pollution. The theanine present in green tea provides neuronal cell protection, lowers blood pressure, helps in the production of dopamine and increases alpha waves to the brain. Thus it relaxes people and promotes good sleep. The caffeine present in green tea increases alertness and decreases tiredness and drowsiness. Vitamin C - The amount of vitamin C in green tea is comparable to a lemon. Folic acid - five cups of green tea a day will provide 5-10% the daily requirement of niacin, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid. The oolong variety was well suited as the canned tea proved stable even at temperatures up to 50° - 60 °C in vending machines. The tea also appealed to consumers inclined to use vending machines for convenient access "on the street." Further, there are perceived health benefits to canned tea, as opposed to other canned soft drinks, due to tea's portrayal as an aid to maintaining a slim body build. The introduction of oolong was quickly followed by the development of canned teas based on other tea varieties, including green and black teas. Additional flavor options also included the addition of sweeteners, sugar, milk and lemon, along with other fruit flavors.

On 28 October 2009, following the club being threatened with administration and on-loan midfielder Lee Sawyer returning to Chelsea, Tilson came out of retirement to play for Southend in the Essex Senior Cup. After Bond's resignation he took caretaker charge of the team until the appointment of Sol Campbell.

The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The unconventional decision to use a two-sided swingarm on a superbike from Ducati was made because of the substantial upgrades added to the bike including electronically adjustable anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic braking control, and a quickshifter. The 899 surprised observers by topping sales charts for all motorcycles in the UK for December 2013, at a price five times higher than the number two seller, the Honda CBF125 — a situation compared by The Telegraph to the Ferrari California outselling the Ford Focus. For 2016, Ducati revised the 899, including enlarging the engine to 955 cc (the 959 Panigale). The Ducati Panigale V2 is a 955 cc (58.3 cu in) sport bike manufactured by Ducati as the successor to the Panigale 959. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale.

Ducati claimed weight is 10 lb heavier than the 1299, with foot pegs 10 mm higher. Ducati and Brembo designed 70 g-lighter brake calipers than the 1299's.

 The Panigale V4's 1103 cc desmodromic 90° V4 engine, unlike the prior 1199 and 1299 where the engine is the primary element of the frame, is surrounded by a more conventional aluminum perimeter frame. The engine is rotated further backwards than other Ducatis, so that the swingarm pivot is mated to the rear cylinders, rather than lower on the engine near the crankshaft. Unlike most street bikes and previous Ducatis other than MotoGP racing machines, the Panigale V4's engine rotates in the opposite direction of the wheels, counteracting the gyroscopic effect and therefore decreasing the force necessary to change the bike's inclination.

The northern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the Korea Bay, into which flow the Yalu River, the Chongchon River and the Taedong River. The peninsula is located in Northeast Asia, between China and Japan. To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia.

He was also one of the first comedians to confront the Troubles in his material, while still appealing to both sides of the divided community. Sean Lock (22 April 1963 – 16 August 2021) was an English comedian and actor. He began his comedy career as a comedian and in 2000 won the British Comedy Award, in the category of Best Live Comic, and was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award. He was a team captain on the Channel 4 comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats from 2005 to 2015, and on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown from 2012 until his death in 2021. Lock frequently appeared on stage, television and radio. His routines were often surreal and delivered in a deadpan style. He also wrote material for Bill Bailey, Lee Evans and Mark Lamarr. Lock was voted the 55th-greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups in 2007, and was ranked 19th in the updated 2010 list. Michael James Dominic Sweeney (born 7 February 1955; Bournemouth, England) is an English actor and comedian, best known for his improvisation partnership with Steve Steen. The pairing's first television work as a duo came on the ITV children's show CBTV, followed by the Channel 4 comedy Little Armadillos and resident support comic slots on Rory Bremner's first sketch show for 

 basis for a series of comic records released by Emerald Records. He then appeared in commercials and radio comedies before acquiring a semi-regular slot as a contestant on the Channel 4 improvisation show Whose Line Is It Anyway? He adapted his award-winning play Danny's Wake into a radio series, 

 Adam Hills (born 10 July 1970) is an Australian comedian and radio and television presenter. In Australia, he hosted the music quiz show Spicks and Specks from 2005 to 2011, and again in 2021, and the talk show Adam Hills Tonight from 2011 to 2013. In the United Kingdom, he has hosted the talk show The Last Leg since 2012. He has been nominated for an Edinburgh Comedy Award, the Gold Logie Award and numerous BAFTA TV Awards. Born in Loftus, Sydney, he began performing as a stand-up comedian in 1989 at the age of 19 and, since 1997, has produced ten solo shows which have toured internationally. He has performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just for Laughs festival, earning three consecutive Edinburgh Award nominations for his Edinburgh shows in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In 1995 the British Comedy Awards gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award for Comedy, and eight years later, a few weeks before he died, the Television and Radio Industries Club awarded him a Special Award for Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting. In a poll of fellow comedians and comedy insiders to find the Comedians' Comedian in 2005, Monkhouse was voted among the best 50 comedy acts. In a piece written several years after Monkhouse's death, critic and satirist Michael Deacon suggested that although Monkhouse had feared that his legacy as a comedian would be limited, as many people knew him only from his decades of work as a game show host, his style of writing and performing could be seen as influencing many contemporary British comedians, such as Jimmy Carr (whose book on comedy The Naked Jape quoted several Monkhouse jokes), Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay, John Bishop, Lee Mack and Tim Vine. They moved into a flat on the 

 A former comedy critic for the Evening Standard and editor of Tough Puzzles, Pye has performed as a comedian. He is, however, known best for his work as a writer, having written material for series including Never Mind the Buzzcocks, They Think It's All Over, Armstrong and Miller, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Would I Lie to You?, and Channel 4's The 100 Greatest Cartoons. He also worked as one of the head writers on 8 out of 10 Cats alongside presenter Jimmy Carr and fellow comedian Frankie Boyle. He first met his comedy partner Harry Thompson while working on The 11 O'Clock Show, and together they created the dark satirical animation Monkey Dust, which broadcast on BBC Three for three series.

Merton's first guest was Nick Hancock and his last was his fellow regular team captain on Have I Got News for You, Ian Hislop. Following Merton's departure in 2007, it was announced that a replacement would be sought; however, it was not until 2012 that a twelfth series, now fronted by Frank Skinner, was aired. The first show was transmitted in January 1956 and the comedian Arthur Haynes appeared on it. The show received a bit of a panning so after the sixth show, George Jr. said to Parsons, "I'm getting rid of everybody but I'm going to keep Arthur Haynes and you.

In "Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta).

This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.

 Uranus was discovered in 1781 and has comparatively rarely been featured in fiction since then. The earliest such works, such as Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1935 short story "The Planet of Doubt" and Clifton B. Kruse's 1936 short story "Code of the Spaceways", portray it as having a solid surface; in the former, humans landing on Uranus encounter hostile aliens. Later works depict it more accurately as a gaseous planet; for instance, Cecelia Holland's 1976 novel Floating Worlds depicts floating cities in the Uranian atmosphere. Towards the end of the 20th century, there was a slight uptick in appearances by Uranus in science fiction, including the 1985 short story "Dies Irae" by Charles Sheffield about life in the atmosphere and the 1999 short story "Into the Blue Abyss" by Geoffrey A. Landis where there is life in the ocean below. Of Uranus' moons, Ariel was discovered in 1851 and appears in J. Harvey Haggard's 1930s novella "Evolution Satellite", and Miranda was discovered in 1948 and appears in the 1993 short story "Into the Miranda Rift" by G. David Nordley. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 1. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell, it is named for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Shakespeare's The Tempest. Both Ariel and the slightly larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, claimed to have observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious. All of Uranus's moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest.

The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy 

 Oberon was discovered by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; on the same day he discovered Uranus's largest moon, Titania. For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope. All of the moons of Uranus are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope. In 1851 Lassell eventually numbered all four known satellites in order of their distance from the planet by Roman numerals, and since then Oberon has been designated Uranus IV. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt to the surface of the moon and lead to cryovolcanism.

 Uranus was discovered in 1781 and has comparatively rarely been featured in fiction since then. The earliest such works, such as Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1935 short story "The Planet of Doubt" and Clifton B. Kruse's 1936 short story "Code of the Spaceways", portray it as having a solid surface; in the former, humans landing on Uranus encounter hostile aliens. Later works depict it more accurately as a gaseous planet; for instance, Cecelia Holland's 1976 novel Floating Worlds depicts floating cities in the Uranian atmosphere. Towards the end of the 20th century, there was a slight uptick in appearances by Uranus in science fiction, including the 1985 short story "Dies Irae" by Charles Sheffield about life in the atmosphere and the 1999 short story "Into the Blue Abyss" by Geoffrey A. Landis where there is life in the ocean below. Of Uranus' moons, Ariel was discovered in 1851 and appears in J. Harvey Haggard's 1930s novella "Evolution Satellite", and Miranda was discovered in 1948 and appears in the 1993 short story "Into the Miranda Rift" by G. David Nordley. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 1. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties.

On June 9, 2010, it was announced that Tony Gilroy would be writing and directing a movie entitled The Bourne Legacy that would have a 2012 release date. The new film would have nothing but the title in common with Van Lustbader's novel, and would be a side-story with a new character "in the mold of Bourne", dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third film. The Bourne Legacy is a 2004 spy fiction thriller written by Eric Van Lustbader. It is the fourth novel in the Jason Bourne series created by Robert Ludlum and the first to be written by Lustbader. He has also written other novels in the series, The Bourne Betrayal, The Bourne Sanction, The Bourne Deception, The Bourne Objective, The Bourne Dominion, The Bourne Imperative, The Bourne Retribution, The Bourne Ascendancy, The Bourne Enigma, The Bourne Initiative and The Bourne Nemesis. With the climactic events of The Bourne Ultimatum behind him, Jason Bourne is able to once again become David Webb, now professor of linguistics at Georgetown University.

 The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 American action-thriller film directed by Paul Greengrass loosely based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. The Bourne Ultimatum is the third installment in the Jason Bourne film series, after The Bourne Identity (2002) and The Bourne Supremacy (2004). The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016. Matt Damon reprises his role as Ludlum's signature character, former CIA assassin and psychogenic amnesiac Jason Bourne.

It is preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and followed by The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016). The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy involving the CIA and Operation Treadstone.

 The Bourne Identity is a 1980 spy fiction thriller by Robert Ludlum that tells the story of Jason Bourne, a man with remarkable survival abilities who has retrograde amnesia, and must seek to discover his true identity. It is the first novel of the original Bourne Trilogy, which also includes The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Peter Cannon of Publishers Weekly named The Bourne Identity among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carré's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper.

Peter Cannon of Publishers Weekly named The Bourne Identity among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carré's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper.

Question: Who wrote the Bourne trilogy of books, made into movies starring Matt Damon?

He and the other two musketeers, Athos and Porthos, are friends of the novels' protagonist, d'Artagnan. Porthos, honest and slightly gullible, is the extrovert of the group, enjoying wine, women and song. Though he is often seen as the comic relief, he is also extremely dedicated and loyal toward his friends and fellow Musketeers and stands out for his physical strength and size. In The Three Musketeers, Athos and the other two musketeers, Porthos and Aramis, are friends of the novel's protagonist, d'Artagnan.

 A young man named d'Artagnan leaves home to travel to Paris, with the intention to join the Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan is not able to join this elite corps immediately, he befriends the three most formidable musketeers of the age — Athos, Porthos and Aramis — and gets involved in affairs of the state and court. The story, set in 17th-century France, follows a young Dogtanian (Darutaniyan (ダルタニヤン) in the original Japanese version and voiced by Satomi Majima (間嶋 里美) and D'Artacán in the Spanish version) who travels from Béarn to Paris in order to become one of King Louis XIII of France's musketeers. He quickly befriends three musketeers (Porthos, Athos and Aramis) saving Juliette, a maid-in-waiting for Queen Anne of Austria. A key difference between the Dogtanian adaptions and Dumas' novel is that the character traits of Athos and Porthos were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group. young Gascon spots the very man and in his haste to confront him, annoys three of the most skillful Musketeers: Athos (Van Heflin), Porthos (Gig Young) and Aramis (Robert Coote).

In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits, while in digitigrade animals, more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs). can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe. The seriema also has an enlarged second toe claw, and uses it to tear apart 

 In terrestrial vertebrates, digitigrade locomotion is walking or running on the toes (from the Latin digitus, 'finger', and gradior, 'walk'). A digitigrade animal is one that stands or walks with its toes (metatarsals) touching the ground, and the rest of its foot lifted. Digitigrades include walking birds (what many assume to be bird knees are actually ankles), cats, dogs, and many other mammals, but not plantigrades or unguligrades. Digitigrades generally move more quickly and quietly than other animals. There are anatomical differences between the limbs of plantigrades, like humans, and both unguligrade and digitigrade limbs. Digitigrade and unguligrade animals have relatively long carpals and tarsals, and the bones which would correspond to the human ankle are thus set much higher in the limb 

 the tibia from sliding forward in relation to the femur. It is attached to the cranial (anterior) medial side of the interdylar notch of the tibia at one end and the caudal (posterior) side of the lateral femoral condyle at the other end. Trauma to the equivalent ligament in humans is common, and damage most frequently occurs during some form of sporting activity (including football, rugby and golf). The nature of the injury is very different in dogs. Rather than the ligament suddenly breaking due to excessive trauma, it usually degenerates slowly over time, rather like a 

 clipped, in the conformation ring. Historically, the breed's tail was typically docked to a length just sufficient to serve as a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Dewclaw Removal: Dewclaws are vestigial nails located on the inside of a dog's leg. It is most commonly seen in larger dog breeds. Lipomas: Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that are quite common in older dogs. It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other procedures and conditions related to dogs. ; The drawer sign: ; The examiner stands behind the dog and places a thumb on the caudal aspect of the femoral condylar region with the index finger on the patella. The other thumb is placed on the head of the fibula with the index finger on the tibial crest. The ability to move the tibia forward (cranially) with respect to a fixed femur is a positive cranial drawer sign indicative of a rupture (it will look like a drawer being opened). ; Another method used to diagnose a rupture is the tibial compression test, in which a veterinarian will stabilize 

 Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”). However, it could also simply mean that the dog isn't receiving enough calories. Professional (surgical) removal of the dewclaw is often the best course of action. Consult your veterinarian about particularly large hot spots.Apply hydrocortisone cream two to three times daily.Skin Irritation: Cleanse area, remove the causative agent, and apply hydrocortisone cream two to three times daily.Superficial Cuts and Scrapes: Cleanse the area with mild soap and water.Baby wipes work well.Apply triple antibiotic ointment twice daily. Entropion has been documented in most dog breeds, although there are some breeds (particularly purebreds) that are more commonly affected than others.

Lehmann's contract with Arsenal expired at the end of the season, and then he decided to retire once again. On 8 September 2018, a match was organised between Arsenal legends and Real Madrid legends in which Lehmann appeared after David Seaman picked up injury during training. Arsenal legends won 5–3 on penalties, with Lehmann scoring the last penalty for Arsenal.

This is a tale of international intrigue and espionage, therefore opening up the possibility of more spy fiction from Christie. Black adds that Christie's work is, in its way, typical of the literature of the interwar period, much of which reflected a concern about foreign threats and links between domestic and international challenges. The Big Four, the characters, are positioned as the hidden cause and connecting threat between the world-wide unrest, labour disputes, and the revolutions of the period—in particular, the October Revolution, with 

 The Enola Holmes Mysteries is a young adult fiction series of detective novels by American author Nancy Springer, starring Enola Holmes as the 14-year-old sister of an already-famous Sherlock Holmes, twenty years her senior. When their mother disappears, Enola's brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, decide to send her to a finishing school against her will. Instead, with the aid of her mother who had provided hidden funds and an elaborate cipher for her daughter to communicate with her, Enola runs away to London where she establishes a clandestine private detective career specializing in 

 Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography is a Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel by Nick Rennison, originally published in 2005. In the novel, Rennison postulates that Sherlock Holmes was involved in various historical events, including the Jack the Ripper case, the Crippen murder case, and World War I. "So, really, the book is three strands woven together. who wrote the note, a Mr Jonathan Whalley, has been murdered. It is the first of the 56 Holmes short stories written by Doyle and the first of 38 Sherlock Holmes works illustrated by Sidney Paget. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. One of Doyle's early short stories, "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste. Cheng Xiaoqing had first encountered Conan Doyle's highly popular stories as an adolescent. This style began China's interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, Sherlock in Shanghai. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle's style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction. Erasing Sherlock is an original novel by Kelly Hale set in the Faction Paradox universe. It has been described as a "fascinating (and undeservedly obscure) novel" and reviewed in publications ranging from various Sherlock Holmes Society publications to the science fiction, Aeon Magazine.

It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving mask. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for underwater activities such as spearfishing, freediving, finswimming, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and for surface breathing with scuba equipment. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter "L" or "J", fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end and constructed of light metal, rubber or plastic. The snorkel may come with a rubber loop or a plastic

  The trim of a diver is the orientation of the body in the water, determined by posture and the distribution of weight and volume along the body and equipment, as well as by any other forces acting on the diver. Both static trim and its stability affect the convenience and safety of the diver while under water and at the surface. This may be accomplished either by accelerating the water past the swimmer or by supporting the swimmer, either in water or on dry land. The first type, known as a countercurrent swimming machine, usually consists of a water tank at least twice as long and about one and a half times as wide as an average person with the limbs extended. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth. After all, being surrounded by the ocean presents the unique opportunity to enjoy activities like surfing, swimming, body surfing, body boarding, paddling and more year-round.

Swimmer’s ear, or otitis externa, can occur when water remains in the outer ear after a swimming session. Some symptoms of swimmer’s ear can include redness, itchiness, pain, temporary hearing loss and pus-like fluid draining from the ear. Wear customized ear plugs in the water. Visit an ear, nose and throat specialist for periodic cleaning. Surfer’s ear, or exostosis, occurs due to a constant exposure to cold water and wind, which makes the condition very rare in Hawaii. This combination encourages bony developments to grow in the ear, therefore restricting the ear canal. Wetsuits do not protect the ears. Wear swim caps or neoprene hoods in the water. A perforated ear drum can happen in water sports when traumatic forces act upon the ear. For example, if an ear is slapped by a wave, the pressure could cause the ear drum to rupture, which makes it more susceptible to infection. However, having an ear, nose and throat specialist monitor the status of the ruptured ear drum is extremely important to ensure the ear is healing properly. Many also either slightly increase

[2024-06-14 14:56:10,679] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background:Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg. Palpation is one of the oldest, simplest, and least expensive methods for approximate IOP measurement. A newer transpalpebral and transscleral tonometry method is not influenced by corneal biomechanics and does not need to be adjusted for corneal irregularities as measurement is done over upper eyelid and sclera. Tonometry . Gonioscopy . You will place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar while looking straight ahead. The goniolens is placed lightly on the front of your eye, and a narrow beam of light is directed into your eye while your doctor looks through the slit lamp at the drainage angle. There are two types of ophthalmoscopy: direct and indirect. With indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ophthalmologist wears a headband with a light attached and uses a small handheld lens to look inside your eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy allows a better view of the fundus, even if your natural lens is clouded by cataracts. The peripheral (side) vision of each eye is tested with visual field testing, or perimetry. While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights will flash off and on. A computer records your response to each flash. Photography . Sometimes photographs or other computerized images are taken of the optic nerve to inspect the nerve more closely for damage from elevated pressure in the eye. Special imaging . The most common form of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma , in which the aqueous fluid is blocked from flowing back out of the eye at a normal rate through a tiny drainage system. Most people who develop primary open-angle glaucoma notice no symptoms

the episcleral venous pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The reason for this is because the vitreous humour in the posterior segment has a relatively fixed volume and thus does not affect intraocular pressure regulation. What's the difference between glaucoma and ocular hypertension? The two most common types of "glaucoma tests" performed during a routine eye exam are non-contact tonometry and applanation tonometry. In non-contact tonometry (NCT), an instrument emits a quick puff of air toward the surface of your eye. Nothing but air touches your cornea.

 Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure used in the treatment of glaucoma to relieve intraocular pressure by removing part of the eye's trabecular meshwork and adjacent structures. This outpatient procedure was most commonly performed under monitored anesthesia care using a retrobulbar block or peribulbar block or a combination of topical and subtenon (Tenon's capsule) anesthesia. Due to the higher risks associated with bulbar blocks, topical analgesia with mild sedation is becoming more common. Rarely general anesthesia will be used, in patients with an inability to cooperate during surgery. Tonometry is a technique used by eye care professionals to measure the intraocular pressure (IOP), which refers to the fluid pressure inside the eye. It plays a crucial role in evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma. There are different types of tonometers available, but most are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The specific method used may vary depending on the equipment and technique employed by the eye care professional. One common type of tonometry is called applanation tonometry, which involves gently touching the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) with a small probe or device. This allows for an accurate measurement of IOP based on how much force is needed to flatten a small area of the cornea. Another type is non-contact tonometry, also known as air-puff tonometry. In this method, a quick puff of air is directed towards the cornea while a sensor measures changes in reflection or indentation caused by the air puff. Overall, tonometry serves as an essential tool for evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma because it allows eye care professionals to measure intraocular pressure accurately.

2024-06-14 14:56:10 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg. Palpation is one of the oldest, simplest, and least expensive methods for approximate IOP measurement. A newer transpalpebral and transscleral tonometry method is not influenced by corneal biomechanics and does not need to be adjusted for corneal irregularities as measurement is done over upper eyelid and sclera. Tonometry . Gonioscopy . You will place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar while looking straight ahead. The goniolens is placed lightly on the front of your eye, and a narrow beam of light is directed into your eye while your doctor looks through the slit lamp at the drainage angle. There are two types of ophthalmoscopy: direct and indirect. With indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ophthalmologist wears a headband with a light attached and uses a small handheld lens to look inside your eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy allows a better view of the fundus, even if your natural lens is clouded by cataracts. The peripheral (side) vision of each eye is tested with visual field testing, or perimetry. While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights will flash off and on. A computer records your response to each flash. Photography . Sometimes photographs or other computerized images are taken of the optic nerve to inspect the nerve more closely for damage from elevated pressure in the eye. Special imaging . The most common form of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma , in which the aqueous fluid is blocked from flowing back out of the eye at a normal rate through a tiny drainage system. Most people who develop primary open-angle glaucoma notice no symptoms

the episcleral venous pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The reason for this is because the vitreous humour in the posterior segment has a relatively fixed volume and thus does not affect intraocular pressure regulation. What's the difference between glaucoma and ocular hypertension? The two most common types of "glaucoma tests" performed during a routine eye exam are non-contact tonometry and applanation tonometry.

There are four main types of tea: black, oolong, green, and white. Tea is a natural source of caffeine, theophylline, theanine, and antioxidants; but it has almost no fat, carbohydrates, or protein Tea has been consumed in China for around 5,000 years. Black tea, also translated to red tea in various Asian languages, is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced. Plain black tea without sweeteners or additives contains caffeine, but negligible quantities of calories or nutrients. Black teas from Camellia sinensis contain polyphenols, such as flavonoids, which are under preliminary research for their potential to affect blood pressure and blood lipids as risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but overall this research remains inconclusive. Long-term consumption of black tea only slightly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures (about 1–2mmHg). Black tea consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of stroke, but there is only limited research to evaluate this possibility. Meta-analyses of observational studies concluded that black tea consumption does not affect the development of oral cancers in Asian or Caucasian populations, esophageal cancer or prostate cancer in Asian populations, or lung cancer. The visible film often formed on black tea consists of oxidized polyphenols and calcium carbonate, and is therefore more pronounced for tea brewed with hard water. **Benefits**

Tea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.This allows natural enzymes in the tea leaves to produce the characteristic red-brown colour and reduced astringency.Grapeseed oil also has beneficial properties and taking 30 ml daily can both increase levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol (which protects against coronary heart disease), and reduce triglyceride levels by around 15 per cent within one month. **Green tea**

Green and black tea are similar in that both are made from the young leaves and leaf buds of the same shrub, _Camellia sinensis_. sinensis sinensis_ ) and the large-leaved Assam tea plant ( _C. sinensis assamica_ ). **Benefits**

Tea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.These are converted into less active antioxidants (such as theaflavins and thearubigins) during fermentation but even so, drinking four to five cups of black tea per day still provides over 50 per cent of the total dietary intake of flavonoid antioxidants (other sources include fruit and vegetables especially apples and onions). Both green and black tea are popular around the world, and have historically been associated with health benefits, though this is not currently supported by scientific research. Black, white, and green tea all come from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Green and white tea contains an abundant amount of polyphenols (which are antioxidant plant elements that have health benefits). The University of Maryland Center says that green tea can help stop the spreading of cancer cells in many forms of the disease, including breast, prostate, esophageal, and stomach. The medical center also says that green tea shows results in preventing atherosclerosis and high cholesterol, which both have the ability to change to heart disease. Studies from Linus Pauling Institute in 2000 performed test on four types of white tea on rats to study their benefits on colon cancer protection. White tea has higher content of polyphenols than green tea. White tea has a group of antioxidants that are proven to reduce cholesterol, decrease blood pressure, repair vein tissue, and general cardiovascular function. The antioxidants of white tea help boost the immune system in both humans and animals. White tea can also thin the blood and improve artery function which in turn is good against high blood pressure. It has also been proven that adding a lemon, soy sauce, or rice milk to green tea greatly enhances the body’s absorption of its antioxidants. Hot brewed tea contains greater concentrations

Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects.Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure.It is also used to promote mental alertness, protect against solar radiation, improve dental health, and prevent aging.There is a concern that adding stevia to beverages such as colas could expose consumers to high doses of stevia, because consumers may drink large quantities. The tea plant is a member of the Theaceae family. Three types of tea—oolong, black, and green—are produced from the leaves of the tea plant, depending on the processing technique. Oolong and green tea are closely related and have been used medicinally for a variety of conditions, including diabetes. USES

Medicinally, tea is used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease, cancer, and obesity. Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects. Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Although closely related, oolong and green tea differ in their caffeine and polyphenol content.Recent evidence indicates that regularly drinking six or more cups a day of green tea may lower your risk of developing of type 2 diabetes.Some of the ingredients in tea are thought to enhance insulin activity, which may be responsible for some of the benefit in diabetes. Green tea has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, starting in China but used widely throughout Asia, this amazing beverage has many uses ranging from diet - weightloss, IBS, to lowering blood pressure, according to the experts. Diabetes – Green tea can help regulate body glucose levels, potentially preventing high insulin levels. Esophageal Cancer – Green Tea can potentially reduce the risk of esophageal cancer, and it is widely thought to kill cancer cells in general without damaging the healthy tissue around them. Tooth Decay – Studies have suggested that catechin in green tea can destroy bacteria and viruses that cause throat infections, dental caries and other dental conditions. Green tea leaves are typically steamed, which prevents the EGCG compound from being oxidized. In contrast, black and oolong tea leaves are made typically from fermented leaves, that results in the EGCG being converted into other compounds, that are not as effective in disease prevention. ; 3) ; Orthodox: The withered tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically through the use of a cylindrical rolling table or a rotovane.

Tea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.This allows natural enzymes in the tea leaves to produce the characteristic red-brown colour and reduced astringency.Grapeseed oil also has beneficial properties and taking 30 ml daily can both increase levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol (which protects against coronary heart disease), and reduce triglyceride levels by around 15 per cent within one month. **Green tea**

Green and black tea are similar in that both are made from the young leaves and leaf buds of the same shrub, _Camellia sinensis_. sinensis sinensis_ ) and the large-leaved Assam tea plant ( _C. sinensis assamica_ ). **Benefits**

Tea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.These are converted into less active antioxidants (such as theaflavins and thearubigins) during fermentation but even so, drinking four to five cups of black tea per day still provides over 50 per cent of the total dietary intake of flavonoid antioxidants (other sources include fruit and vegetables especially apples and onions). Both green and black tea are popular around the world, and have historically been associated with health benefits, though this is not currently supported by scientific research. Black, white, and green tea all come from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Green and white tea contains an abundant amount of polyphenols (which are antioxidant plant elements that have health benefits). The University of Maryland Center says that green tea can help stop the spreading of cancer cells in many forms of the disease, including breast, prostate, esophageal, and stomach. The medical center also says that green tea shows results in preventing atherosclerosis and high cholesterol, which both have the ability to change to heart disease. Studies from Linus Pauling Institute in 2000 performed test on four types of white tea on rats to study their benefits on colon cancer protection. White tea has higher content of polyphenols than green tea. White tea has a group of antioxidants that are proven to reduce cholesterol, decrease blood pressure, repair vein tissue, and general cardiovascular function. The antioxidants of white tea help boost the immune system in both humans and animals. White tea can also thin the blood and improve artery function which in turn is good against high blood pressure. It has also been proven that adding a lemon, soy sauce, or rice milk to green tea greatly enhances the body’s absorption of its antioxidants. Hot brewed tea contains greater concentrations

Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects.Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure.It is also used to promote mental alertness, protect against solar radiation, improve dental health, and prevent aging.There is a concern that adding stevia to beverages such as colas could expose consumers to high doses of stevia, because consumers may drink large quantities. The tea plant is a member of the Theaceae family. Three types of tea—oolong, black, and green—are produced from the leaves of the tea plant, depending on the processing technique. Oolong and green tea are closely related and have been used medicinally for a variety of conditions, including diabetes. USES

Medicinally, tea is used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease, cancer, and obesity. Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects. Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Although closely related, oolong and green tea differ in their caffeine and polyphenol content.Recent evidence indicates that regularly drinking six or more cups a day of green tea may lower your risk of developing of type 2 diabetes.Some of the ingredients in tea are thought to enhance insulin activity, which may be responsible for some of the benefit in diabetes. Green tea has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, starting in China but used widely throughout Asia, this amazing beverage has many uses ranging from diet - weightloss, IBS, to lowering blood pressure, according to the experts. Diabetes – Green tea can help regulate body glucose levels, potentially preventing high insulin levels. Esophageal Cancer – Green Tea can potentially reduce the risk of esophageal cancer, and it is widely thought to kill cancer cells in general without damaging the healthy tissue around them. Tooth Decay – Studies have suggested that catechin in green tea can destroy bacteria and viruses that cause throat infections, dental caries and other dental conditions. Green tea leaves are typically steamed, which prevents the EGCG compound from being oxidized. In contrast, black and oolong tea leaves are made typically from fermented leaves, that results in the EGCG being converted into other compounds, that are not as effective in disease prevention. ; 3) ; Orthodox: The withered tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically through the use of a cylindrical rolling table or a rotovane.

[2024-06-14 14:56:15,418] [opencompass.openicl.icl_inferencer.icl_gen_inferencer] [WARNING] ??????????????final prompt:Background: In Japanese folklore, Kitsune (狐, キツネ) are intelligent foxes that possess paranormal abilities that increase as they get older and wiser. According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Conversely foxes were often seen as "witch animals", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). These shapes are not limited by the fox's own age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxy traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form. In some stories, kitsune retain—and have difficulty hiding—their tails when they take human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. Kitsune can also 

The zenko (善狐) are benevolent, celestial foxes associated with Inari; they are sometimes simply called Inari foxes in English. They are a type of yōkai. This does not mean that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. There are two common classifications of kitsune:  Local traditions add further types. For example, a ninko is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses them. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: "Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes 

 Depictions of kitsune or people possessed by them may feature round white balls known as hoshi no tama (ほしのたま). When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail. One belief is that when a kitsune changes shape, its hoshi no tama holds a portion of its magical power. The following is a list of appearances made by kitsune (Japanese foxes) in various works of popular fiction. Embedded in popular folklore as they are, kitsune have made appearances in many contemporary Japanese works. Specific depictions of kitsune include:

 In folk religion, stories of fox possession can be found in all lands of Japan. There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki.

Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Conversely foxes were often seen as "witch animals", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). These shapes are not limited by the fox's own age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxy traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form. In some stories, kitsune retain—and have difficulty hiding—their tails when they take human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. Kitsune can also 

The zenko (善狐) are benevolent, celestial foxes associated with Inari; they are sometimes simply called Inari foxes in English. They are a type of yōkai. This does not mean that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. There are two common classifications of kitsune:  Local traditions add further types. For example, a ninko is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses them. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: "Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes 

 Depictions of kitsune or people possessed by them may feature round white balls known as hoshi no tama (ほしのたま). When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail. One belief is that when a kitsune changes shape, its hoshi no tama holds a portion of its magical power. The following is a list of appearances made by kitsune (Japanese foxes) in various works of popular fiction. Embedded in popular folklore as they are, kitsune have made appearances in many contemporary Japanese works. Specific depictions of kitsune include:

 In folk religion, stories of fox possession can be found in all lands of Japan. There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki.
