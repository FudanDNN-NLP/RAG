David Barlow was played by Alan Rothwell for a period of eight years between 1960 and 1968.

Latrobe became a patent lawyer and was shy about taking credit for his stoves which succeeded Benjamin Franklin's much larger Franklin stove.\n\n"

It was his son, Harry E. Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure balloon tires around 1939. The process was not applied to vehicle tires on a large scale until the 1950s, when superior tread compounds were developed that could stand up to the siping process. A US patent to Goodyear also claimed sipes improve tire traction, and tend to close completely in \n\n Lorin Beryl Sebrell (19 November 1894 – 5 August 1984) was an American scientist at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. noted for identifying mercaptobenzothiazole as a vulcanization accelerator. In 1942, Sebrell received the Charles Goodyear Medal. A team under German chemist Fritz Hofmann first synthesizes synthetic rubber (Methylkautschuk). ; Linde–Frank–Caro process was invented by Adolf Frank and developed with Carl von Linde and Heinrich Caro. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile and the need for rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of \n\n2-Mercaptobenzothiazole is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula C7H5NS2. These synthetic routes were initially developed by the compound's discoverer, A. W. Hoffmann. This effect was first reported by researchers at Pirelli and Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The plant-derived latex crosslinked with sulfur that was introduced as a denture base material in 1853 was called vulcanized rubber. This process was first developed by Charles Goodyear in the mid-19th century and revolutionized the use of rubber in various applications, including denture base materials. In the fall of 1928 Bock had the idea to copolymerize dimethyl butadiene with isoprene and butadiene, respectively, to combine the positive mechanical properties. Both synthetic rubbers had mechanical properties almost comparable with natural rubber. In spring 1929 Bock replaced dimethyl butadiene by styrene.

It was there that he made the first modern puncture patch, a thin circular patch of flexible rubber that was already coated with a gum that did not need to be heated. He patented his invention, offering “ instant repair of inner tubes without solutions, without petrol, without anything ” The patent covered the patch, the dry fixative attached to it, and the protective bands which kept the patch clean until they were removed just before the repair.

Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure balloon tires around 1939. The process was not applied to vehicle tires on a large scale until the 1950s, when superior tread compounds were developed that could stand up to the siping process. A US patent to Goodyear also claimed sipes improve tire traction, and tend to close completely in \n\n Lorin Beryl Sebrell (19 November 1894 – 5 August 1984) was an American scientist at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. noted for identifying mercaptobenzothiazole as a vulcanization accelerator. In 1942, Sebrell received the Charles Goodyear Medal. A team under German chemist Fritz Hofmann first synthesizes synthetic rubber (Methylkautschuk). ; Linde–Frank–Caro process was invented by Adolf Frank and developed with Carl von Linde and Heinrich Caro. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile and the need for rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of \n\n2-Mercaptobenzothiazole is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula C7H5NS2. These synthetic routes were initially developed by the compound's discoverer, A. W. Hoffmann. This effect was first reported by researchers at Pirelli and Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The plant-derived latex crosslinked with sulfur that was introduced as a denture base material in 1853 was called vulcanized rubber.

Georgia-born Augusta Jane Evans (1835-1909) moved to Mobile in 1849 and wrote many popular novels that incorporated aspects of her experience in Alabama. In 1960, Harper Lee, born in Monroeville, published perhaps the most celebrated novel set in Alabama, To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\n"

As illustrated in the Quran numerous times: \"... it [theQuran] is guidance for the righteous… for those who believe in the unseen\" (2:3-4). These verses are mentioned at the beginning of the Quran as core characteristics of a believer and consequently all six articles of faith are based on this notion of \"the unseen\". Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edward Peters, \"The Qur’ān insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews . The Qur’an's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham\". Muslims believe that God (Allah) is beyond all comprehension and equal, and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, are not expected to visualize God, and instead of having pictures of Allah in their mosques, typically have religious calligraphy written on the wall. According to Islamic belief, Allah is the most common word to represent God, and humble submission to his will, divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith. \"He is unique (wāḥid) and inherently one (aḥad), all-merciful and omnipotent.\" and in the Ayat ul-Kursi (\"Verse of the Throne\"), which is the 255th verse and the powerful verse in the longest chapter (the 2nd chapter) of the Qur'an, Al-Baqarah (\"The Cow\") states:  In Islam, Allah is the unique, omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to God in other Abrahamic religions. In the Quran, God warns of grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife, and admonishes mankind that hellfire is prepared for the disbelievers. Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's creation is entirely to worship God alone, which includes being kind to other humans as well as animals and plants, by not oppressing them. The Quran repeatedly reminds the reader that the worldly life (ḥayāt ad-dunyā) is nothing but a test and to determine \n\n God), reported in the Litanias Lauretanas.

As illustrated in the Quran numerous times: \"... it [theQuran] is guidance for the righteous… for those who believe in the unseen\" (2:3-4). These verses are mentioned at the beginning of the Quran as core characteristics of a believer and consequently all six articles of faith are based on this notion of \"the unseen\". Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edward Peters, \"The Qur’ān insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews . The Qur’an's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham\". Muslims believe that God (Allah) is beyond all comprehension and equal, and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, are not expected to visualize God, and instead of having pictures of Allah in their mosques, typically have religious calligraphy written on the wall. According to Islamic belief, Allah is the most common word to represent God, and humble submission to his will, divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith. \"He is unique (wāḥid) and inherently one (aḥad), all-merciful and omnipotent.\" and in the Ayat ul-Kursi (\"Verse of the Throne\"), which is the 255th verse and the powerful verse in the longest chapter (the 2nd chapter) of the Qur'an, Al-Baqarah (\"The Cow\") states:  In Islam, Allah is the unique, omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to God in other Abrahamic religions. In the Quran, God warns of grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife, and admonishes mankind that hellfire is prepared for the disbelievers. Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's creation is entirely to worship God alone, which includes being kind to other humans as well as animals and plants, by not oppressing them. The Quran repeatedly reminds the reader that the worldly life (ḥayāt ad-dunyā) is nothing but a test and to determine \n\n God), reported in the Litanias Lauretanas. Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is transcendent and does not resemble any of his creations in any way.

The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle, distinct from the proton. The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and nuclear weapons by the end of World War II.

Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases.

He was the father of the second U.S. president, John Adams Jr., and grandfather of the sixth president, John Quincy Adams. He was also descended from John and Priscilla Alden. Adams worked as a farmer and cobbler (also called a cord-wainer or shoemaker) for most of his life. Adams' descendants include many prominent persons in American history, and his home is a National Park, the Adams National Historical Park. Not only was he the father and grandfather of presidents; he also was a first cousin, once removed, of Samuel Adams. He was a Congregationalist (that is, Puritan) deacon. The younger John Adams wrote of the religion his father was so passionate for, \"[they are] bearers of freedom, a cause that still had holy urgency.\" He \n\n In 1720, Adams purchased a farm in what is now Quincy, Massachusetts (then called the \"north precinct\" of Braintree, Massachusetts). The location of his farm, and where his children were born, is now part of Adams National Historical Park. This saltbox house, a simple and common dwelling characterized by its sloping roof, is operated by the National Park Service as the John Adams Birthplace, and is open to the public.

He graduated from Yale College in 1779, was a tutor there from 1781 to 1783, and studied law.

Crawford, and Henry Clay in the 1824 presidential election. Like Monroe, Adams sought a geographically-balanced cabinet that would represent the various party factions, and he asked the members of the Monroe cabinet to remain in place for his own administration. Adams chose Henry Clay as Secretary of State, angering those who believed that Clay had offered his support in the 1824 election for the most prestigious position in the cabinet. Adams presided over a harmonious and productive cabinet. Although Maryland voted for John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford and Henry Clay, only three electoral votes were assigned to Adams, while Jackson received seven and Crawford received one. After a period of consideration, he voted for the Tariff of 1828, which raised tariff rates. While Clay rallied support for the party in the West, he emerged as a leading National Republican in the Northeastern states. Despite his efforts and those of Clay, Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson decisively defeated President Adams in the 1828 election. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1804. Senator from Massachusetts (1817–1822), and then Mayor of Boston (1829–1831).\n\nQuestion: what was john quincy adams famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Adams worked as a farmer and cobbler (also called a cord-wainer or shoemaker) for most of his life. Adams' descendants include many prominent persons in American history, and his home is a National Park, the Adams National Historical Park. Not only was he the father and grandfather of presidents; he also was a first cousin, once removed, of Samuel Adams. He was a Congregationalist (that is, Puritan) deacon. The younger John Adams wrote of the religion his father was so passionate for, \"[they are] bearers of freedom, a cause that still had holy urgency.\" He \n\n In 1720, Adams purchased a farm in what is now Quincy, Massachusetts (then called the \"north precinct\" of Braintree, Massachusetts).

Crawford, and Henry Clay in the 1824 presidential election. Like Monroe, Adams sought a geographically-balanced cabinet that would represent the various party factions, and he asked the members of the Monroe cabinet to remain in place for his own administration. Adams chose Henry Clay as Secretary of State, angering those who believed that Clay had offered his support in the 1824 election for the most prestigious position in the cabinet. Adams presided over a harmonious and productive cabinet. Although Maryland voted for John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford and Henry Clay, only three electoral votes were assigned to Adams, while Jackson received seven and Crawford received one. After a period of consideration, he voted for the Tariff of 1828, which raised tariff rates. While Clay rallied support for the party in the West, he emerged as a leading National Republican in the Northeastern states. Despite his efforts and those of Clay, Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson decisively defeated President Adams in the 1828 election. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1804. Senator from Massachusetts (1817–1822), and then Mayor of Boston (1829–1831).\n\n"

Despite this there are several areas of Indonesia where Muslims are the minority: ; 84% of the population of Bali practice a form of Hinduism called Balinese Hinduism, although Hindus only form 1.7% of Indonesia's overall population. ; Protestants form the majority in three Indonesian provinces: West Papua at 60%, Papua at 68%, and North Sulawesi at 64%. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of this province are very diverse, including Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Protestantism forms the second-largest religion, forming as many as 9.74%, while Catholics forms as many as 1.02%, Most of the people who adhered to Protestantism and Catholicism are from Batak ethnic groups (specifically Batak Toba, Karo and Simalungun), Nias, Chinese and residents from Eastern Indonesia. Lastly, about 0.01% of the total population embrace Hinduism, mostly are Balinese and Indonesians of Indian descent. Buddhism has a long history in Indonesia, and is recognized as one of six official religions in Indonesia, along with Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism and Confucianism. According to the 2018 national census roughly 0.8% of the total citizens of Indonesia were Buddhists, and numbered around more than 2 million. Most Buddhists are concentrated in Jakarta, Riau, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung, North Sumatra, and West Kalimantan. These totals, however, are probably inflated, as practitioners of Taoism and Chinese folk religion, which are not considered official religions of Indonesia, likely declared themselves as Buddhists on the most recent census. By the end of the 16th century, Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra. After that for 450 years, there is no significant Buddhist adherence and practice in Indonesia.\n\n"

In the United States, lung cancer causes more deaths than all other types of cancers. It is crucial to diagnose and treat lung cancer as early as possible for effective treatment. Approximately 25% of lung cancer cases do not display symptoms. Certain types of lung cancer are highly aggressive and spread quickly through the body. The generic five-year survival rate for lung cancer is roughly 15%. Lung cancer tumors often impede the lung’s ability to provide the body with oxygen via the blood. It is the leading cause of worldwide cancer-related deaths, accounting for roughly 1.3 million deaths a year. This death toll is higher than that of colon, prostate, and breast cancer deaths combined. The majority of lung cancer cases are carcinomas, or malignancies arising from epithelial cells that line the airways of the lungs. There are two main types of primary lung cancer: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma. There are other types of lung cancer that are more rare, including carcinoid tumors, glandular tumors, and undifferentiated carcinomas. There are three subtypes of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common, accounting for nearly 40% of lung cancer cases. These carcinomas are typically found close to larger airways. Large-cell carcinoma accounts for roughly 9% of lung cancers. SCLC is also known as oat-cell carcinoma due to its flat shape.

Professor X later convinces Munroe to join the X-Men and use her abilities for a greater cause and purpose. Mystique (Raven Darkhölme) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by artist David Cockrum and writer Chris Claremont, she first appeared in the comic book Ms. Marvel #16 (April 1978). Typically portrayed as a foe of the X-Men, Mystique has been both a supervillain and an antiheroine, founding her own Brotherhood of \n\n to the X-Men. With Moira, she is transported to an alternate Earth where Britain is dominated by Nazis. Meanwhile, the Nazi counterparts of Callisto and Moira appear on the mainstream Earth. Both Callisto and Moira and their counterparts then return to their native Earths. They alternated between doing graduate work and earning a postgraduate degree in the American Southwest – where they occasionally encountered the Hulk – and helping out Moira MacTaggert at her facility for genetic research on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland. They are both defeated by the combined forces of the Avengers and the X-Men, and Moira dies during a failed prison escape. Moira IX: Even further radicalized, Moira decides to ally with Apocalypse and go to war with humankind. Moira X: Facing her last life and looking back at all her experiences, Moira decides that in this timeline, she and Xavier will \"break all the rules.\" She meets Xavier in Oxford and tells him to read her mind showing him all she has done. She prevents Rogue from giving up her mutant powers and continues her investigation of the U.S. Government over her son's death, leading to her aiding Toad and his most recent incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants on a mission to raid a government base. Xavier trains her in the use of her telekinesis, while inhibiting her telepathic abilities until she matures. Around this time, he also starts working with fellow mutation expert, Karl Lykos, as well as Moira MacTaggert again, who built a mutant research station on Muir Island. Xavier discusses his candidates for recruitment to his personal strike force, the X-Men, with Moira, including those he passes over, which are Kurt Wagner, Piotr Rasputin, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, and Ororo Munroe.\n\n"

His wife was Rudidevi and his son Vijitasena. He left home and performed austerities for ten months until he was given milk rice by Yasodhara, daughter of the merchant Saundana. At the temple, he met the Buddhist monk Moggaliputta Tissa, and became more devoted to the Buddhist faith. This legend about Ashoka's search for a worthy teacher may be aimed at explaining why Ashoka did not adopt Jainism, another major contemporary faith that advocates non-violence and compassion. The legend suggests that Ashoka was not attracted to Buddhism because he was looking for such a faith, rather, for a competent spiritual teacher. The Sri Lankan tradition adds that during his 6th regnal year, Ashoka's son Mahinda became a Buddhist monk, and his daughter became a \n\n Anomadassi Buddha was born in Chandawatinagara. As soon as his son was born, he decided to leave the palace to practise asceticism. Buddhism in Nepal started spreading since the reign of Ashoka through Indian and Tibetan missionaries. It has not been possible to assign with certainty the year in which Prince Siddhartha, the birth name of the Buddha, was born, it is usually placed at around 563 BCE. A story in Divyavadana attributes Ashoka's conversion to the Buddhist monk Samudra, who was an ex-merchant from Shravasti. According to this account, Samudra was imprisoned in Ashoka's \"Hell\", but saved himself using his miraculous powers. When Ashoka heard about this, he visited the monk, and was further impressed by a series of miracles performed by the monk. A story in the Ashokavadana states that Samudra was a merchant's son, and was a 12-year-old boy when he met Ashoka; this account seems to be influenced by the Nigrodha story. Another story claims that the young boy ate 500 Brahmanas who were harassing \n\n Buddha's Birthday (also known as Buddha Jayanti, also known as his day of enlightenment - Buddha Purnima, Buddha Pournami) is a Buddhist festival that is celebrated in most of East Asia and South Asia commemorating the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Gautama Buddha, who was the founder of Buddhism. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563–483 BCE in Lumbini. The exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. In South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of Vesak, a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment (on the day of the full moon) and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays. Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th century BCE or c. 5th to 4th century BCE). He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being, who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. One day, Ashoka saw a young Buddhist monk called Nigrodha (or Nyagrodha), who was looking for alms on a road in Pataliputra. Ashoka was impressed by Nigrodha's tranquil and fearless appearance, and asked him to teach him his faith. Impressed by the sermon, Ashoka offered Nigrodha 400,000 silver coins and 8 daily portions \n\n rest of the saṅgha for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments. He was known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and was often praised by the \n\n Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art.

He left home and performed austerities for ten months until he was given milk rice by Yasodhara, daughter of the merchant Saundana. At the temple, he met the Buddhist monk Moggaliputta Tissa, and became more devoted to the Buddhist faith. This legend about Ashoka's search for a worthy teacher may be aimed at explaining why Ashoka did not adopt Jainism, another major contemporary faith that advocates non-violence and compassion. The legend suggests that Ashoka was not attracted to Buddhism because he was looking for such a faith, rather, for a competent spiritual teacher.

As soon as his son was born, he decided to leave the palace to practise asceticism. Buddhism in Nepal started spreading since the reign of Ashoka through Indian and Tibetan missionaries. It has not been possible to assign with certainty the year in which Prince Siddhartha, the birth name of the Buddha, was born, it is usually placed at around 563 BCE. A story in Divyavadana attributes Ashoka's conversion to the Buddhist monk Samudra, who was an ex-merchant from Shravasti. According to this account, Samudra was imprisoned in Ashoka's \"Hell\", but saved himself using his miraculous powers. When Ashoka heard about this, he visited the monk, and was further impressed by a series of miracles performed by the monk. A story in the Ashokavadana states that Samudra was a merchant's son, and was a 12-year-old boy when he met Ashoka; this account seems to be influenced by the Nigrodha story. Another story claims that the young boy ate 500 Brahmanas who were harassing \n\n Buddha's Birthday (also known as Buddha Jayanti, also known as his day of enlightenment - Buddha Purnima, Buddha Pournami) is a Buddhist festival that is celebrated in most of East Asia and South Asia commemorating the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Gautama Buddha, who was the founder of Buddhism. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563–483 BCE in Lumbini. The exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. In South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of Vesak, a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment (on the day of the full moon) and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays. Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama or Buddha Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th century BCE or c. 5th to 4th century BCE). He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being, who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. One day, Ashoka saw a young Buddhist monk called Nigrodha (or Nyagrodha), who was looking for alms on a road in Pataliputra. Ashoka was impressed by Nigrodha's tranquil and fearless appearance, and asked him to teach him his faith. Impressed by the sermon, Ashoka offered Nigrodha 400,000 silver coins and 8 daily portions \n\n rest of the saṅgha for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments.

Along with her husband Will Smith, she has a production company, and has had producing credits in films, documentaries, and television series. Since 1997, Pinkett Smith has been married to Will Smith, with whom she has two children: son Jaden and daughter Willow. Through their marriage, she is also stepmother to Smith's son from his earlier marriage, Trey Smith. Willow 'whips' her hair to give colour to the lockers and the students' attire, before performing choreography with the hallway students. The last scenes shows Smith, wearing puff braids and a yellow jumpsuit, trying to get her backup singers to dance in a classroom, which is intercut with more paint-splashing scenes as the dancers, including her brother Jaden and actor Cameron Boyce, teachers, the janitor, an elderly lady, and a toddler dance. A writer for Rap-Up said that Smith \"is in a class of her own in the breakout video for her empowering anthem\", calling the video \"the birth of more B.S.\". Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Jada Pinkett Smith was named after her mother's favorite soap opera actress, Jada Rowland. Pinkett Smith is of Jamaican and Bajan descent on her mother's side and African-American descent on her father's side. Her parents are Adrienne Banfield-Jones, the head nurse of a Baltimore inner-city clinic, and Robsol Pinkett Jr., who ran a construction company. Banfield-Jones, who during the 2010s became Adrienne Banfield-Norris, became pregnant in high school; the couple married but divorced after several months. Banfield-Jones raised Pinkett with the help of her own mother, Marion Martin Banfield, a Jamaican-born social worker. Banfield noticed her granddaughter's passion for the performing arts and enrolled her in piano, tap dance, and ballet lessons. Pinkett Smith has remained close to her mother \n\n The video begins in a futuristic cafeteria with kids, dubbed the \"Warriorettes\", sitting down at grey tables in white clothing. Smith enters the room in colorful attire (including a blue vest, orange pants and a belt with her name on it, rhinestones on her lips and extravagant nail tips). On July 10, during an episode of Red Table Talk featuring Will Smith, Pinkett Smith confirmed an \"entanglement\" with Alsina during her separation from Will, although not with Will's permission. Pinkett Smith further claimed she wanted to \"heal\" Alsina, but needed to find healing for herself first. In 2021, Pinkett Smith stated that she was guilty of having an affair with a man; Will Smith also admitted to having had sex outside the marriage as well. said, \"A mother and daughter's relationship is usually the most honest, and we are so close.\" She also added: \"[My mother] understood what I wanted and never stood in my way.\" Pinkett Smith has shown great admiration for her grandmother, saying, \"My grandmother was a doer who wanted to create a better community and add beauty to the world.\" Pinkett Smith attended the Baltimore School for the Arts, where she met and became close friends with her classmate, rapper Tupac Shakur. Her mother had been a heroin addict. In an interview with Rap-Up, Kay said \"I'm certain people that are watching the video will feel inspired to develop their own individuality and freedom and express their own art after seeing Willow in this video.\" Willow is definitely here to stay, she's a superstar. HOUSTON – JULY 03, 2018 – In a May episode of “Red Table Talk,” Jada Pinkett Smith opened up about her recent hair loss, starting a conversation about an issue that is shockingly common, but rarely discussed: alopecia among African-American women. Pinkett-Smith shared her fears, insecurities and treatment plan with her audience. Yates is hopeful that Jada Pinkett Smith’s announcement will help change the way women think about alopecia. In the past months, Pinkett Smith has been wearing scarves, turbans, and head wraps to cover up her hair loss. Yates believes that Pinkett Smith will become an inspiration and style icon to thousands of women with hair loss. think we managed to create a fresh expression using Willow's amazing energy, a positive and inspiring concept, and mixing the colors of the sets with Willow's fashion, which consisted of custom-made clothing and exclusive One Z jumpsuits.\n\n"

The reason why there are many jobs to be done in a hospital is that there is more work to be done other than treatment only. You will find clinical and nonclinical personnel in a hospital. Here are some of the descriptions of the different people who work in hospitals and what they are involved in. One of the jobs in a hospital is that of the medical assistant. The work of administration in a doctor’s office or hospital is carried out by a medical assistant. Licensed practical nurses provide basic health care in hospitals, nursing homes, health facilities, and also clinics. Some of the work done by the practical licensed nurses is drawing blood, noting patients records, taking vital signs, and administering medicine. It is also important to learn that therapists are also important staff in a hospital. The people who help patients deal and overcome with what they are facing in their daily lives are the therapists. A diagnostic medical sonographer is also an important person in a hospital. A diagnostic medical sonographer operates the imaging machines found in a hospital. The sonographer passes the info to the physician who is responsible for diagnosis and treatment. First, you need to dig up a little bit of history about the person you will be working with.

The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students. As of 2021, approximately 150 million users use Google Classroom. Google Classroom integrates a variety of other Google Applications for Education, such as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Gmail, and Google Calendar into a cohesive platform to manage student and teacher communication. Students can be invited to join a class through a private \"class code\", or be imported automatically from a school domain. Teachers can create, distribute and mark assignments all within the Google domain. Each class creates a separate folder in the respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher. Assignments and due dates are added to Google Calendar, where each assignment can belong to a category or topic. Teachers can monitor each student's progress by reviewing revision history of a document, and after being graded, teachers can return work along with comments and grades. Students study a science-heavy curriculum, which will include classes like anatomy & physiology, basic physics, instrumentation, radiology, patient care, medical ethics, and ultrasound principles. Everything the student learns can be immediately applied on the job—on the first day! Diagnostic medical sonographers work in clinics, hospitals, and diagnostic imaging centers. Breast sonography, neurosonography (which is focused on the nervous system and the brain), obstetric and gynecological sonography, cardiac sonography, abdominal sonography (which focuses on pancreas, spleen, liver, kidneys, and male reproductive system), and vascular sonography (which focuses on the circulatory system). The equipment used during the process captures the echoes created and turns them into images that can then be read by a physician trained in examining those images. This non-invasive means of getting answers regarding patient symptoms and conditions is a preferred method of diagnosis. Sonographers not only run the machines, but they also explain the procedure to the patient. The field allows you to help patients get answers to their concerns and questions and provide reassurance. Many people enjoy their jobs as sonographers. Sites such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity claim to offer the best price – sometimes even guaranteed.

Google Inc. was officially launched in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to market Google Search, which has become the most used web-based search engine. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University in California, developed a search algorithm at first known as \"BackRub\" in 1996, with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg. The search engine soon proved successful and the expanding company moved several times, finally settling at Mountain View in 2003. This marked a phase of rapid growth, with the company making its initial public offering in 2004 and quickly becoming one of the world's largest media companies.

The reason why there are many jobs to be done in a hospital is that there is more work to be done other than treatment only. You will find clinical and nonclinical personnel in a hospital. Here are some of the descriptions of the different people who work in hospitals and what they are involved in. One of the jobs in a hospital is that of the medical assistant. The work of administration in a doctor’s office or hospital is carried out by a medical assistant. Licensed practical nurses provide basic health care in hospitals, nursing homes, health facilities, and also clinics. Some of the work done by the practical licensed nurses is drawing blood, noting patients records, taking vital signs, and administering medicine. It is also important to learn that therapists are also important staff in a hospital. The people who help patients deal and overcome with what they are facing in their daily lives are the therapists. A diagnostic medical sonographer is also an important person in a hospital. A diagnostic medical sonographer operates the imaging machines found in a hospital. The sonographer passes the info to the physician who is responsible for diagnosis and treatment. First, you need to dig up a little bit of history about the person you will be working with.

The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students. As of 2021, approximately 150 million users use Google Classroom. Google Classroom integrates a variety of other Google Applications for Education, such as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Gmail, and Google Calendar into a cohesive platform to manage student and teacher communication. Students can be invited to join a class through a private \"class code\", or be imported automatically from a school domain. Teachers can create, distribute and mark assignments all within the Google domain. Each class creates a separate folder in the respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher. Assignments and due dates are added to Google Calendar, where each assignment can belong to a category or topic. Teachers can monitor each student's progress by reviewing revision history of a document, and after being graded, teachers can return work along with comments and grades. Students study a science-heavy curriculum, which will include classes like anatomy & physiology, basic physics, instrumentation, radiology, patient care, medical ethics, and ultrasound principles. Everything the student learns can be immediately applied on the job—on the first day! Diagnostic medical sonographers work in clinics, hospitals, and diagnostic imaging centers. Breast sonography, neurosonography (which is focused on the nervous system and the brain), obstetric and gynecological sonography, cardiac sonography, abdominal sonography (which focuses on pancreas, spleen, liver, kidneys, and male reproductive system), and vascular sonography (which focuses on the circulatory system). The equipment used during the process captures the echoes created and turns them into images that can then be read by a physician trained in examining those images. This non-invasive means of getting answers regarding patient symptoms and conditions is a preferred method of diagnosis. Sonographers not only run the machines, but they also explain the procedure to the patient. The field allows you to help patients get answers to their concerns and questions and provide reassurance. Many people enjoy their jobs as sonographers. Sites such as Expedia, Orbitz, and Travelocity claim to offer the best price – sometimes even guaranteed.

Rodd. She married attorney Dale W. Hagen in 1960; the couple divorced in 1978. During the 1970s, she appeared in several made-for-television productions, and continued making appearances on television shows through the next three decades. Miller left the SNL staff in 1979 to work on Radner's one-woman Broadway revue and movie, Gilda Live.″ After more theatrical work, she returned to weekly television as a producer on The Tracey Ullman Show, for which she won another Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program in 1990. Miller was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in 1992. In 1998, she wrote an episode about breast cancer for Murphy Brown, winning a Humanitas Prize. She died of a heart attack during the series' final season. One of the last episodes she filmed before her death, \"Mother Dexter's Wedding\", marked the final appearance of veteran actor Burt Mustin, who played her bridegroom, Arthur Lanson. By the time the episode aired in December 1976, Lowry had died at age 86, and the 92-year-old Mustin, who died in January 1977, was too ill to see it. Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, NY, was founded in 1898 as the nation’s first center devoted to cancer research, setting the standard for today’s multidisciplinary approach to cancer research and patient care. Roswell Park is among a select group of Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. The Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry was established at Roswell Park in 1981 by then-Chair of Gynecologic Oncology, M. Steven Piver, MD. In 1990, it was named The Gilda Radner Registry to honor the memory of American comedian Gilda Radner, who died of ovarian cancer in 1989. Her husband, actor and producer Gene Wilder generously agreed to lend his late wife’s name to the registry in an effort to increase awareness of the disease and to help national research efforts. Under the direction of Dr. Odunsi, the Registry is investigating other genetic causes of ovarian cancer in order to better detect, prevent and treat the disease.

During the 1970s, she appeared in several made-for-television productions, and continued making appearances on television shows through the next three decades. Miller left the SNL staff in 1979 to work on Radner's one-woman Broadway revue and movie, Gilda Live.″ After more theatrical work, she returned to weekly television as a producer on The Tracey Ullman Show, for which she won another Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program in 1990. Miller was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in 1992. In 1998, she wrote an episode about breast cancer for Murphy Brown, winning a Humanitas Prize. She died of a heart attack during the series' final season. One of the last episodes she filmed before her death, \"Mother Dexter's Wedding\", marked the final appearance of veteran actor Burt Mustin, who played her bridegroom, Arthur Lanson. By the time the episode aired in December 1976, Lowry had died at age 86, and the 92-year-old Mustin, who died in January 1977, was too ill to see it. Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, NY, was founded in 1898 as the nation’s first center devoted to cancer research, setting the standard for today’s multidisciplinary approach to cancer research and patient care. Roswell Park is among a select group of Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. The Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry was established at Roswell Park in 1981 by then-Chair of Gynecologic Oncology, M. Steven Piver, MD. In 1990, it was named The Gilda Radner Registry to honor the memory of American comedian Gilda Radner, who died of ovarian cancer in 1989. Her husband, actor and producer Gene Wilder generously agreed to lend his late wife’s name to the registry in an effort to increase awareness of the disease and to help national research efforts. Under the direction of Dr. Odunsi, the Registry is investigating other genetic causes of ovarian cancer in order to better detect, prevent and treat the disease.

The Enquirer cited claims from an anonymous source that Edwards had engaged in an affair with Rielle Hunter, a filmmaker hired to work for his 2008 presidential campaign, and that Hunter had given birth to a child from the relationship. ABC News reported that Andrew Young, a member of Edwards' campaign team, stated that Edwards asked him to, \"Get a doctor to fake the DNA results ... and to steal a \n\n On August 8, in a statement that coincided with the Opening Ceremonies of the 2008 Olympic Games, Edwards admitted to the affair but denied he was the father of the child, expressing his willingness to take a paternity test. In July 2008, several U.S. mainstream news outlets cited the allegations in relation to Edwards' future political career, as well as in relation to his chances of being selected as a running mate in Barack Obama's 2008 presidential bid. Then, on August 7, 2008, Edwards admitted to ABC News correspondent Bob Woodruff that he did have an extended affair with Hunter, but denied that he was the father of \n\n my child and I'm going to take legal action against the people who are spreading these lies.' Edwards' admission that he engaged in an affair came less than a day after these warnings were published. When asked about Edwards' future in public service, Bonior further stated, \"You can't lie in politics and expect to have people's confidence.\" night on the ABC News program Nightline, in which her husband admitted the affair to Woodruff. Elizabeth, in her statement, criticized the claims that her husband fathered a child as an \"absurd lie in a tabloid publication.\" On August 12, a friend of Hunter's, Pigeon O'Brien, informed CBS News that Edwards had lied about \n\n A federal grand jury investigated whether any of Edwards' campaign funds were misspent on covering up the affair and, on August 6, 2009, Hunter testified before a federal grand jury in Raleigh. In February 2010, the Enquirer reported that Edwards had proposed to Hunter, but that report was categorically denied by an Edwards spokesperson. Rielle Hunter also released a book about the relationship and announced her breakup with Edwards on the day of the book's release in 2012. On February 9, 2016, Hunter spoke on Steve Harvey in her first televised interview in almost five years, and stated she and Edwards were still dating until February of 2015. According to Donald Fowler, former Democratic National Committee chair, \"If there is not an explanation that's satisfactory, acceptable and meets high moral standards, the answer is 'no,' [Edwards] would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention.\" The statement said that, in 2006, \"John had made a terrible mistake,\" though she went on to praise her husband for \"courage in the face of shame.\" She also said that she hoped people would watch the interview that aired later \n\n an advisor to Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign from 2003 to 2004.\n\n"

Lead by Hammer, the group was responsible for Florida passing a permissive concealed carry handgun law. Following an 18-month investigation, on August 6, 2020, Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, filed a civil lawsuit against the NRA alleging fraud, financial misconduct, and misuse of charitable funds by some of its executives, including its long-time CEO and EVP Wayne LaPierre, treasurer Wilson Phillips, former chief of staff and current executive director of general operations Joshua Powell and general counsel and secretary John Frazer. The suit calls for the dissolution of the NRA as being \"fraught with fraud and abuse.\" The lawsuit alleges that the NRA made payments directly to Marion Hammer, and made grants paid to USF. According to the lawsuit, in 2018 the NRA audit committee retroactively approved $3.69 million that the NRA had already paid to Hammer between 1998 and 2017. It has been described as being to the right of the National Rifle Association. On December 21, 2012 – between the formation of Biden's task force and the announcement of Obama's proposals – Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown.

Carter was an advocate for gun rights in the United States. Carter's 1977 election as NRA Executive Vice President marked a turning point for the organization. During his tenure, from 1977 to 1985, he shifted the organization's focus from promoting marksmanship and sports shooting towards strident advocacy for less restrictive gun laws. Under Carter's leadership, the NRA became less compromising on gun rights issues.

Lead by Hammer, the group was responsible for Florida passing a permissive concealed carry handgun law. Following an 18-month investigation, on August 6, 2020, Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, filed a civil lawsuit against the NRA alleging fraud, financial misconduct, and misuse of charitable funds by some of its executives, including its long-time CEO and EVP Wayne LaPierre, treasurer Wilson Phillips, former chief of staff and current executive director of general operations Joshua Powell and general counsel and secretary John Frazer. The suit calls for the dissolution of the NRA as being \"fraught with fraud and abuse.\" The lawsuit alleges that the NRA made payments directly to Marion Hammer, and made grants paid to USF. According to the lawsuit, in 2018 the NRA audit committee retroactively approved $3.69 million that the NRA had already paid to Hammer between 1998 and 2017.

        "context": "Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the peninsula between the York River and James River, southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the Peninsula Campaign, Also in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his Valley Campaign. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's spring 1862 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Cross Keys by fighting off an attack from Union troops under Maj. Gen. John C. Frémont, and then seizing the initiative to counterattack and rout them. It was created on October 22, 1861, as Johnston prepared defenses in Northern Virginia. The Valley District was defined as the area between the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Alleghenies and extended south from the Potomac River to the vicinity of Staunton, Virginia and covered an area of roughly five thousand square miles. It fought again at Cross Keys before being sent eastward to reinforce the Union troops after the Peninsula Campaign. County&ndash; Confederate cavalry attacks the town and the small untrained Union force stationed there. Battle of Hancock (January 5–6, 1862), Morgan County – Stonewall Jackson's operations against the B&O Railroad. ; Battle of the Henry Clark House (May 1, 1862), Mercer County, West Virginia – Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign – Cox's actions against Princeton and the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad at Dublin, Virginia. The armies clashed briefly at McCoy's Mill (three miles south of Franklin, now a National Historic Site), but Jackson withdrew and returned to the Shenandoah Valley to continue his campaign. From January 22–24, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the Tallapoosa River. They arrived the day after the Battle of Cedar Mountain, and joined Pope's army in its retreat from that Confederate victory. After a series of minor actions along the Rappahannock, Pope's forces met Jackson's half of Lee's army near Manassas Station. Lee had divided his army into wings led by Jackson and Lt. Gen. James Longstreet and sent Jackson's force to raid Pope's rear to cut his supply line. Pope believed he had a chance to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia one half at a time, and made \n\n 20. After resting for two weeks at Winchester, the division started, on May 2, under command of General William Rosecrans, and after crossing the Allegheny Mountains marched into western Virginia through Romney, and joined General John C. Frémont's Mountain Department forces. On May 24, Frémont forces started for the Shenandoah Valley to pursue Confederate Major General Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley. The regiment's first engagement occurred on June 8 at the Battle of Cross Keys, Virginia, in which Frémont's forces were defeated by a Confederate corps under command of Jackson.\n\n"

Bush's tenure as the 41st president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 1989, and ended on January 20, 1993. Bush was a Republican from Texas and the incumbent vice president for two terms under president Ronald Reagan. Bush took office following a landslide victory over Democrat nominee Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election. His presidency ended following his defeat in the 1992 presidential election by Democrat Bill Clinton. By December 2008, 60% of Americans gave George H. W. Bush's presidency a positive rating. In the 2010s, Bush was fondly remembered for his willingness to compromise, which contrasted with the intensely partisan era that followed his presidency. Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country, but especially in the South. Having served in various government positions, particularly the position of Director of the CIA, Bush sought the presidential nomination in the 1980 Republican primaries. He was defeated by Ronald Reagan, a conservative former governor from California. Seeking to balance the ticket with an ideological moderate, Reagan selected Bush as his running mate. Reagan triumphed over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and Bush took office as vice president in 1981. Bush entered the 1988 \n\n The 2000 United States presidential election in Connecticut took place on November 7, 2000, and was part of the 2000 United States presidential election. Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Connecticut was won by Vice President Al Gore by a 17.5% margin of victory. Five months later, in June 1999, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 2000. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush was nominated for President of the United States and narrowly won the election against Al Gore. In the aftermath of allied victory in the Gulf War, Bush was widely considered to be likely to win re-election, but Clinton defeated Bush in large part by focusing on the economy. Despite his defeat, Bush left office with a 56 percent job approval rating, and he remained popular with the public until his death in 2018. Historians generally view Bush as a passive, hands-off president who was \"successful in foreign affairs but a disappointment in domestic affairs.\" In 2000, the United States presidential election in New Jersey, along with every U.S. state and Washington, D.C., took place on November 7, 2000 as part of the 2000 United States presidential election. The major party candidates were Democratic Vice President Al Gore of the incumbent administration and Republican Governor of Texas George W. Bush, son of the 41st U.S. president, George H. W. Bush. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, \n\n for his Presidency, with opponents such as Bill Clinton and Ross Perot claiming that he ignored domestic issues and exclusively solved foreign ones.

        "context": " George H. W. Bush's tenure as the 41st president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 1989, and ended on January 20, 1993. Bush was a Republican from Texas and the incumbent vice president for two terms under president Ronald Reagan. Bush took office following a landslide victory over Democrat nominee Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election. His presidency ended following his defeat in the 1992 presidential election by Democrat Bill Clinton. By December 2008, 60% of Americans gave George H. W. Bush's presidency a positive rating. In the 2010s, Bush was fondly remembered for his willingness to compromise, which contrasted with the intensely partisan era that followed his presidency. Bush ran well in all the major regions of the country, but especially in the South. Having served in various government positions, particularly the position of Director of the CIA, Bush sought the presidential nomination in the 1980 Republican primaries. He was defeated by Ronald Reagan, a conservative former governor from California. Seeking to balance the ticket with an ideological moderate, Reagan selected Bush as his running mate. Reagan triumphed over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and Bush took office as vice president in 1981. Bush entered the 1988 \n\n The 2000 United States presidential election in Connecticut took place on November 7, 2000, and was part of the 2000 United States presidential election. Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Connecticut was won by Vice President Al Gore by a 17.5% margin of victory. Five months later, in June 1999, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 2000. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, Bush was nominated for President of the United States and narrowly won the election against Al Gore. In the aftermath of allied victory in the Gulf War, Bush was widely considered to be likely to win re-election, but Clinton defeated Bush in large part by focusing on the economy. Despite his defeat, Bush left office with a 56 percent job approval rating, and he remained popular with the public until his death in 2018. Historians generally view Bush as a passive, hands-off president who was \"successful in foreign affairs but a disappointment in domestic affairs.\" In 2000, the United States presidential election in New Jersey, along with every U.S. state and Washington, D.C., took place on November 7, 2000 as part of the 2000 United States presidential election. The major party candidates were Democratic Vice President Al Gore of the incumbent administration and Republican Governor of Texas George W. Bush, son of the 41st U.S. president, George H. W. Bush. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, \n\n for his Presidency, with opponents such as Bill Clinton and Ross Perot claiming that he ignored domestic issues and exclusively solved foreign ones. Despite his defeat, Bush climbed back from low election day approval ratings to leave office in 1993 with a 56%\n\n"

Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious. Once SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon. Initial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town.

Special Containment Procedures: Samples of SCP-3105 are to be stored in a liquid N2-cooled storage container. Testing with SCP-3105 is to be subject to standard precautionary procedures for virulent pathogens. Note that SCP-3105 constitutes a Class A, UN 2814 biohazard. However, the transportation stage of an SCP-3105 infection occurs over an extremely short period. In addition, SCP-3105 targets Type II alveolar cells, causing minor shortness of breath and allowing airborne infection. Note that SCP-3105 is largely asymptomatic during its transport stage, though it is still present in the bloodstream, and remains infectious. Once SCP-3105 reaches the central nervous system, it will target the medial temporal lobe2. Symptoms at this stage of infection include anterograde amnesia. In the final stage of infection, SCP-3105 targets parts of the temporal lobe assigned with semantic and episodic memory. The final stage of SCP-3105 infection lasts between 5 and 19 days. Testing with SCP-3105 has failed to show evidence for this phenomenon. Initial samples of SCP-3105 were collected after unidentified GOI activity in the area surrounding Spruce Creek, Colorado, and the subsequent radio silence from the town. Much of the local population, as well as local insect populations, were found to be infected with SCP-3105. It is not only the largest in Hawaii but also in the United States.

Cellular Pathology: Virchow formulated theories on cellular pathology during his time at Würzburg. Anthropological Work: Virchow started his anthropological work, studying the skulls of cretins and investigating the development of the base of the skull. His anthropological research contributed to the understanding of human anatomy and the effects of various conditions on skeletal structures. He focused on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, hospital design, meat inspection, and school hygiene. He supervised the design of two new Berlin hospitals, opened a nursing school, and designed the city's sewer system. Virchow's contributions had a profound impact on medicine and public health, shaping our understanding of diseases, promoting advancements in anatomical research, and advocating for healthcare improvements. In 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics.In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin.He pioneered the modern concept of pathological processes by his application of the cell theory to explain the effects of disease in the organs and tissues of the body. Moreover, he campaigned vigorously for social reforms and contributed to the development of anthropology as a modern science. In 1839 Virchow began the study of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute of the University of Berlin and was graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1843. At Würzburg Virchow published many papers on pathological anatomy. He began there the publication of his six-volume _Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie_ (\"Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics\"), most of the first volume of which he wrote himself. At Würzburg he also began to formulate his theories on cellular pathology and started his anthropological work with studies of the skulls of cretins (dwarfed, mentally deficient individuals) and investigations into the development of the base of the skull. During the 19th century, Germany was the center of the medical world, and several influential physicians emerged during this time. Some notable figures were Kussmaul, Quincke, von Recklinghausen, Müller, and Schönlein. These physicians made significant contributions to medicine and clinical observation, and their relationships with Virchow played a crucial role in shaping their work. In particular, Virchow's relationships with his mentors Müller and Schönlein had a profound impact on the development of Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen as students of Virchow. Virchow, as a mentor, provided guidance and inspiration to his students, fostering an environment of scientific and intellectual growth. Von Recklinghausen, also a student of Virchow, had a significant impact on the field of medicine through his contributions to pathology and dermatology. Virchow's mentorship and his emphasis on cellular pathology, meticulous observation, and accurate documentation influenced these individuals in their respective fields. Virchow founded the medical fields of cellular pathology and comparative pathology (comparison of diseases common to humans and animals). This is regarded as the basis of modern medical science, and the \"greatest advance which scientific medicine had made since its beginning.\" His very innovative work may be viewed as between that of Giovanni Battista Morgagni, whose work Virchow studied, and that of Paul Ehrlich, who studied at the Charité while Virchow was developing microscopic pathology there. One of Virchow's major contributions to German medical education was to encourage the use of microscopes by medical students, and he was known for constantly urging his students to \"think microscopically\". He was the first to establish a link between infectious diseases between humans and animals, for which he coined the term \"zoonoses\". Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of cells and cancer. Although Virchow made significant contributions to cellular biology and our understanding of cancer, it is important to mention that he rejected the notion that bacteria can cause disease and the value of cleanliness in preventing infection.

(In subsequent years, Romney became pro-life and opposed Roe. ) Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy won re-election to his sixth full term, defeating the Republican nominee, businessman Mitt Romney. Romney was later elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, was the Republican nominee for President of the United States in 2012, in which he lost the presidency to then-incumbent President Barack Obama, and he ultimately became a U.S. Senator from Utah in 2018, 24 years later. Romney defeated his closest competitor, John Lakian, to win the Republican primary, with over 80% of the vote. Through her ex-husband, she was the sister-in-law of Mitt Romney, who would later serve as Governor of Massachusetts (2003-2007) and U.S. Senator from Utah (since 2019), and was the 2012 Republican nominee for President.

Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the Nile River, reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium BC, which is referred to as the New Kingdom period. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilisation included, at different times, areas of the southern Levant, the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea coastline, the Sinai Peninsula and the Western Desert (focused on the several oases). It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during Naqada III and its unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period. Both Upper and Lower Egypt became imbedded within the symbolism of the sovereignty in Ancient Egypt such as the Pschent double crown. For geopolitical purposes, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa.

During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great. The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture.

Egypt has coastlines on the Mediterranean Sea, the River Nile, and the Red Sea. Egypt has an area of 1,002,450 km2 which makes it the 31st largest country in the world. Egypt has more than 2,900 km of coastline on the Mediterranean Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Gulf of Aqaba. They enjoy popularity even among non-Egyptians.

Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the Nile River, reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium BC, which is referred to as the New Kingdom period. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilisation included, at different times, areas of the southern Levant, the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea coastline, the Sinai Peninsula and the Western Desert (focused on the several oases). It is believed to have been united by the rulers of the supposed Thinite Confederacy who absorbed their rival city states during Naqada III and its unification with Lower Egypt ushered in the Early Dynastic period. Both Upper and Lower Egypt became imbedded within the symbolism of the sovereignty in Ancient Egypt such as the Pschent double crown.

During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great. The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture.

Bolivia has been a completely landlocked country ever since. It mostly uses seaports in eastern Argentina and Uruguay for international trade because its diplomatic relations with Chile have been suspended since 1978. In general, Latin America is still subject to a developmental lag when it comes to education, and higher education in particular. The country of Brazil is the main exception to this \"developmental lag\". Brazil boasts many of the top universities in Latin America, in some of the country's richest areas. Low amounts of money are invested into research and development in the region. One-third of the country is within the Andean mountain range.

The unexpected tendency of consumers to spend their legacy currency, rather than exchange it at banks, led to temporary shortages of euro small change, with some consumers being given change in legacy currency. Some businesses did take advantage of the currency exchange to raise prices. According to a study by the Deutsche Bundesbank, there was a price rise, but consumers refused to buy as much. A coffee bar in Italy that took advantage of the transition to raise coffee prices by a third was ordered to pay compensation to customers.

Thomson thought that the negatively-charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a sea of positive charge that was distributed across the whole volume of the atom.

On the 1984 Costello album Goodbye Cruel World and its accompanying tour, he was credited as \"Maurice Worm.\" He wrote some material on The Attractions' Costello-less album, Mad About the Wrong Boy under the name Norman Brain, in collaboration with his then girlfriend, Fay Hart. In the mid-1980s, Costello began to work less frequently with the Attractions and stopped working with them entirely between \n\n of Costello's albums since the mid-1990s, including 1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration Painted From Memory, 2001's Anne Sofie von Otter collaboration For the Stars and 2003's North. In 2001 Costello formed a new backing band consisting of Nieve, Attractions drummer Pete Thomas, and bassist Davey Faragher. Elvis Costello & the Imposters have toured extensively and released the albums When I Was Cruel (2002), Cruel Smile (2003), The Delivery Man (2004), The River in Reverse (2006) with Allen Toussaint and Momofuku (2008), National Ransom (2010), and Look Now (2018). Declan Patrick McManus, OBE (born 25 August 1954), known professionally as Elvis Costello, is an English singer-songwriter. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Costello number 80 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Costello began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album My Aim Is \n\n At the insistence of Costello's record company, \"You Little Fool\" was released as the first single from Imperial Bedroom in June 1982. The latter was credited to \"the Emotional Toothpaste,\" which was a pseudonym for Costello. The single was accompanied by a music video, where Costello and the Attractions act in roles relating to the song's lyrics. In 1985, the song was released as a single to promote the compilation album The Man: The Best Of Elvis Costello. The release was accompanied by a newly created music video that featured clips from previous Elvis Costello music videos. City Pages named the song one of Costello's 30 best deep cuts, praising the \"buoyant bounce underpinning some of Costello's darkest lyrics\" on the track. Tony Clayton-Lea of the Irish Times described the song as one of Costello's \"back-catalogue gems\" and praised the \"staccato backdrop\" and \"spooky vocal\". Tucker Beathard (born January 24, 1995) is an American country music singer and songwriter. A son of songwriter Casey Beathard, Beathard was signed to Dot Records, a subsidiary of Big Machine Records in 2015 where he released his debut single titled \"Rock On\" and released an EP titled Fight Like Hell in 2016. The first single from his third album titled \"Prayin' For You\" was released on December 10, 2021\n\n \"New Lace Sleeves\" is a song written by new wave musician Elvis Costello and performed by Costello and the Attractions for his 1981 album Trust. The first version of the song was written by Costello in 1974 and featured post-war themed lyrics that were largely scrapped in the final recording. In the final version of the song, Costello included lyrics about seduction and power. Pete Thomas notably performed a drum beat inspired by songs from Devo and Stevie Wonder. The track has also made multiple appearances in Costello's live performances.\n\n"

By the time he married Deborah Hitchborn, a member of a long-standing Boston family that owned a small shipping wharf, in 1729, Rivoire had anglicized his name to Paul Revere. Their son, Paul Revere, was the third of 12 children and eventually the eldest surviving son. Revere grew up in the environment \n\n weak economy, since army service promised consistent pay. On August 4, 1757, he married Sarah Orne (1736–1773); their first child was born eight months later. Revere relented and returned to his father's church, although he did become friends with Mayhew, and returned to the West Church in the late 1760s. Revere's father died in 1754, when Paul was legally too young to officially be the master of the family silver shop. As for religion, although his father attended Puritan services, Revere was drawn to the Church of England. In 1750, aged 15, Revere was part of the first group of change ringers to ring the new bells (cast in 1744) at Christ Church, in the north of Boston (the Old North Church). Revere eventually began attending the services \n\n 1770 Revere purchased a house on North Square in Boston's North End. Sarah died in 1773, and on October 10 of that year, Revere married Rachel Walker (1745–1813). They had eight children, three of whom died young. He boarded in Watertown, where he was eventually joined by Rachel and most of his children (Paul Jr., then 15, remained in Boston to mind the family properties). He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April 1775 to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord, as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, \"Paul Revere's Ride\". At age 41, Revere was a prosperous, established and prominent Boston silversmith. Revere later served as a Massachusetts militia officer, though his service ended after the Penobscot Expedition, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the American Revolutionary War, for which he was absolved of blame. Following the war, Revere returned to his silversmith trade. Revere remained politically active throughout his life. Revere died on May 10, 1818, at the age of 83, at his home on Charter Street in Boston. Revere was born on April 30, 1777 in Boston, Massachusetts.

By the time he married Deborah Hitchborn, a member of a long-standing Boston family that owned a small shipping wharf, in 1729, Rivoire had anglicized his name to Paul Revere. Their son, Paul Revere, was the third of 12 children and eventually the eldest surviving son. Revere grew up in the environment \n\n weak economy, since army service promised consistent pay. On August 4, 1757, he married Sarah Orne (1736–1773); their first child was born eight months later. Revere relented and returned to his father's church, although he did become friends with Mayhew, and returned to the West Church in the late 1760s. Revere's father died in 1754, when Paul was legally too young to officially be the master of the family silver shop. As for religion, although his father attended Puritan services, Revere was drawn to the Church of England. In 1750, aged 15, Revere was part of the first group of change ringers to ring the new bells (cast in 1744) at Christ Church, in the north of Boston (the Old North Church). Revere eventually began attending the services \n\n 1770 Revere purchased a house on North Square in Boston's North End. Sarah died in 1773, and on October 10 of that year, Revere married Rachel Walker (1745–1813). They had eight children, three of whom died young. He boarded in Watertown, where he was eventually joined by Rachel and most of his children (Paul Jr., then 15, remained in Boston to mind the family properties). He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April 1775 to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord, as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, \"Paul Revere's Ride\". At age 41, Revere was a prosperous, established and prominent Boston silversmith. Revere later served as a Massachusetts militia officer, though his service ended after the Penobscot Expedition, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the American Revolutionary War, for which he was absolved of blame. Following the war, Revere returned to his silversmith trade. Revere remained politically active throughout his life. Revere died on May 10, 1818, at the age of 83, at his home on Charter Street in Boston. Revere was born on April 30, 1777 in Boston, Massachusetts.

The book provides an overview of the historical and philosophical debates that have continued throughout the history of evolutionary theory, and carry on to this day in debates surrounding the merits of gene-centric selection and group selection models. The book is particularly critical of the popular science author Richard Dawkins, claiming that he presents a brand of evolutionary theory that portrays natural selection as acting at the level of the individual gene to the exclusion of group selection models which state that it could also act at the level of organisms or species. The book also claims Dawkins embraces an outdated and prescriptive conception of evolution that actually restricts debate rather than promoting it. The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas. The Selfish Genius has been criticized in The Economist for failing to fully understand Dawkins' selfish gene metaphor, with the reviewer claiming Dawkins accommodates proposed alternative evolutionary mechanism Elsdon-Baker suggests within her own ideas. However a generally positive reception has been seen amongst proponents of group selection and Philip Ball wrote a largely positive review in The Times that acknowledges she is right to \"call time on a Whiggish view of the history of evolution\". Popular Science author Brian Clegg reviewed the book and described it as brilliantly identifying how Dawkins' views sit within the latest theories on evolution. He was also profoundly influenced by Robert Chambers' work, Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things. ...'

The book is particularly critical of the popular science author Richard Dawkins, claiming that he presents a brand of evolutionary theory that portrays natural selection as acting at the level of the individual gene to the exclusion of group selection models which state that it could also act at the level of organisms or species. The book also claims Dawkins embraces an outdated and prescriptive conception of evolution that actually restricts debate rather than promoting it. The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas. The Selfish Genius has been criticized in The Economist for failing to fully understand Dawkins' selfish gene metaphor, with the reviewer claiming Dawkins accommodates proposed alternative evolutionary mechanism Elsdon-Baker suggests within her own ideas. However a generally positive reception has been seen amongst proponents of group selection and Philip Ball wrote a largely positive review in The Times that acknowledges she is right to \"call time on a Whiggish view of the history of evolution\". Popular Science author Brian Clegg reviewed the book and described it as brilliantly identifying how Dawkins' views sit within the latest theories on evolution. He was also profoundly influenced by Robert Chambers' work, Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things. ...' From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds is a 2017 book about the origin of human consciousness by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, in which the author makes a case for a materialist theory of mind, arguing that consciousness is no more mysterious than gravity. Drawing on ideas from René Descartes and Charles Darwin, Dennett writes that: and that:\n\n A review for the National Center for Science Education by Louise Mead states that the book \"should be required reading for those teetering on the edge of accepting evolution, as well as anyone interested in learning more about the great epic of life\", and that it provides evocative and powerful examples of how evolution works and why it matters.\n\n"

Benjamin Franklin really enjoyed his grandchildren, particularly Benjamin Franklin Bache. When Franklin returned from England in 1775 he became enthralled by his young grandson. Franklin would begin to consider men and women as more intellectually equal later in his life, but he did not take this approach to his own children and grandchildren.

Franklin's father wanted him to attend school with the clergy but only had enough money to send him to school for two years. He attended Boston Latin School but did not graduate; he continued his education through voracious reading. Although \"his parents talked of the church as a career\" for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten.

Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter and signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first United States postmaster general. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library Company, Philadelphia's first fire department, and the \n\n  The New-England Courant was founded on August 17, 1721 by James Franklin and was the third newspaper to appear in Boston. He owned his own printing press and type brought over from London where he had served as an apprentice. After describing the exploits of some of his ancestors, Amos tells his own story: The eldest of twenty-six siblings living in the Christ Church in Philadelphia, he sets out on his own in 1745 to find work.\n\n"

Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization.

After 1945 Stalin did not directly engage in any wars. Stalin continued his totalitarian rule until his death in 1953. Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food.

In defiance of Churchill's assessment, Stephen Kotkin's attempts to unravel and understand Stalin and his Soviet Union in the second of a three-volume biography of Stalin. In the first volume of Kotkin's biography, he detailed how the world that Stalin was born into molded his personality and shaped his views as he developed into the person who would in turn mold the Bolshevik party and shape the Soviet government, both of which he would come to dominate. In this second volume, Kotkin begins to explore and understand the person who had come to dominate party and government and his evolution from dictator to despot, from a ruthless and brutal revolutionary into a mass murderer and architect of genocide.

Stalin sought to destroy his political rivals while transforming Soviet society with central planning, in particular a collectivization of agriculture and a development of heavy industry. Stalin's power within the party and the state was established and eventually evolved into Stalin's cult of personality, Soviet secret-police and the mass-mobilization. Stalin's methods in achieving his goals, which included party purges, political repression of the general population, and forced collectivization, led to \n\n of deaths: in Gulag labor camps, during the man-made famine, and during forced resettlements of population. After 1945 Stalin did not directly engage in any wars. Stalin continued his totalitarian rule until his death in 1953. Despite harsh conditions, the war led to a spike in Soviet nationalism and unity. The people of the Soviet Union were probably better prepared than any other nation involved in World War II to endure the material hardships of the war – primarily because they were so used to shortages and economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I had brought similar restrictions on food. MVD was authorized to hold, when deemed necessary, such political prisoners beyond the expiration dates of their sentences and to send them to the so-called \n\n Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, dies of a stroke. He is replaced by Nikita Khrushchev, who began a period of De-Stalinization. As a result of this association, Malenkov became heavily involved in Stalin's purges before later being given sole responsibility over the Soviet missile program during World War II. Following Stalin's death on 5 March 1953, Malenkov temporarily emerged as the Soviet leader's undisputed successor by replacing him as both Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or \n\n Mark Atwood Lawrence in his review of Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941 for The New York Times, quotes Winston Churchill's 1939 assessment about understanding Stalin's Soviet Union: \"It is,\" Churchill said, \"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\". In defiance of Churchill's assessment, Stephen Kotkin's attempts to unravel and understand Stalin and his Soviet Union in the second of a three-volume biography of Stalin. In the first volume of Kotkin's biography, he detailed how the world that Stalin was born into molded his personality and shaped his views as he developed into the person who would in turn mold the Bolshevik party and shape the Soviet government, both of which he would come to dominate. In this second volume, Kotkin begins to explore and understand the person who had come to dominate party and government and his evolution from dictator to despot, from a ruthless and brutal revolutionary into a mass murderer and architect of genocide. Having to detour around German-occupied locations, Sakhnov and four other officers from his unit and the 3rd Army staff slowly made their way northeast on foot. He and the other officers reached Soviet lines on 6 September north of Andreapol in the sector of the 133rd Rifle Division of the 22nd Army, unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes, without his identity papers.

Dwyer’s own early series Cardz (1980), for example, was created from an archive the artist had assembled of magazine clippings, advertisements and news stories purporting to depict “everyday life.” Dwyer distilled from these images a set of twenty-six \n\n Nancy Dwyer (born 1954) is an American contemporary artist whose works include paintings, works on paper, public art, word sculpture and furniture art. Her work has been exhibited widely at venues including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, the New Museum in New York and many others. Bianca is no stranger to dressing in drag. In an interview with After Ellen in 2008, Bianca expressed surprise and pleasure at never being criticized for her portrayal of gender, saying, \"I find it interesting that as a 'female' artist in this time, I can go in complete drag on a regular basis and no one really notices, where as an artist like Antony [of Antony and the Johnsons] was torn apart about [her] transexuality in all of the first major articles written about [her].\"\n\n"

Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject \n\n following six works: Aristotle's Metaphysics has some points of overlap with the works making up the Organon but is not traditionally considered part of it; additionally there are works on logic attributed, with varying degrees of plausibility, to Aristotle that were not known to the Peripatetics. Aristotle introduced what may be called a scientific method. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: empiricism. For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. It was therefore the work of the philosopher to demonstrate universal truths and to discover their causes. For this task Aristotle used the tool of deductive reasoning in the form of syllogisms. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. He also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400) during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense. Instead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative \n\n poet Dante called him “the master of those who know\". Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. Aristotle has been called \"the father of logic\", \"the father of biology\", \"the father of political science\", \"the father of zoology\", \"the father of embryology\", \"the father of natural law\", \"the father of scientific method\", \"the father of rhetoric\", \"the father of psychology\", \"the father of realism\", \"the father of criticism\", \"the father of individualism\", \"the father of teleology\", and \"the father of meteorology\". More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.

Sam’s (not his real name) chief complaint was recurrent viral infections. He had chronic gastroesophageal reflux, which was worse in Spring, and severe asthma with strider. The physicians advised that he would outgrow it, so they didn’t treat it at that time. He had used an epinephrine pen at that time because soon after his vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) at 18 months he developed breathing difficulties with “strider,” a high-pitched crowing sound of his airway closing off when trying to breathe.

A civil war has been ongoing in Libya since 2014, and after 2016 the country was mainly divided between the Tobruk-based House of Representatives in the east, and the Government of National Accord in Tripoli and western Libya.

When the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) was established in Tripoli, part of the Libyan military forces were named the Libyan Army to contrast with the other part that retained the LNA identity. In the ongoing Civil War, the LNA is loyal to that part of the Libyan House of Representatives that meets in Tobruk, internationally recognised until October \n\n in Skhirat, Morocco, although there was opposition to this within both factions. The Government of National Accord was formed as a result of this agreement, and its first meeting took place in Tunis on 2 January 2016.

Dutch (Nederlands ) is a West Germanic language spoken by about 25 million people as a first language and 5 million people as a second language, constituting most of the population of the Netherlands (where it is the only official language countrywide) and about 60% of the population of Belgium (as one of three official languages). Outside the Low Countries, it is the native language of the majority of the population of Suriname where it also holds an official status, as it does in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, which \n\n indicated there, and only a single vowel was written. That eventually led to the modern Dutch spelling system. The official language of the Netherlands is Dutch, spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands. Dutch is also spoken and official in Aruba, Brussels, Curaçao, Flanders, Sint Maarten and Suriname. It is a West Germanic, Low Franconian language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardized in the 16th century. Several dialects of Low Saxon (Nedersaksisch in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. blijven (\"to stay\") → blijf  \"(I) stay\" ; huizen \"houses\" → huis  \"house\" leven (\"to live\") → leefde  \"(I) lived\" ; blozen (\"to blush\") → bloosde  \"(I) blushed\" blaffen (\"to bark\") → blafte  \"(I) barked\" ; ruisen (\"to rustle, to hiss\") → ruiste  \"(I) rustled\" The letters and  are somewhat special: Then, therefore, final devoicing is reflected in the spelling:  However, and  are \n\n dialects are spoken outside of the German language area, in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n"

Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the Gulf of Alexandretta to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. In 1941, with the First Geography Congress which divided Turkey into seven geographical regions based on differences in climate and landscape, the eastern provinces of Turkey were placed into the Eastern Anatolia \n\n  The Turkish Straits (Türk Boğazları) are two internationally significant waterways in northwestern Turkey. They consist of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The straits are on opposite ends of the Sea of Marmara. Located in the western part of the landmass of Eurasia, the Straits are conventionally considered the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia, as well as the dividing line between European Turkey and Asian Turkey. Owing to their strategic importance in international commerce, politics, and warfare, the Straits have played a significant role in European and world history. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian \n\n Turkey is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia – thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persian descent. This cultural influence mainly stems from the Iranian culture, which spread through multiple ways but mainly during the early modern period where Iranian and Ottoman contact flourished and the influence of the Kurds, an Iranian ethnic group, on Turkish culture. In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent Ottoman Empire. However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe. In the United Nations geopolitical Eastern European Group, Armenia and Georgia are included in Eastern Europe, whereas Cyprus and East Thracian Turkey are in Southern Europe. These three nations are listed in the European category of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). East Thrace has an area of 23,764 km2 (3 percent of Turkey's land area), slightly smaller than Sardinia, and a population of about 16-17 million people or about 20 percent of the total Turkish population (in 2021); the population density is around 430 people/km2, compared to about 80 people/km2 for Asiatic Turkey, which is also called Anatolia or Asia Minor. The two continents are separated by the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus (collectively known as the Turkish Straits) and the Sea of Marmara, a route of about 361 km. European Turkey is bordered on the west by Greece for 212 km and on the north by Bulgaria for 269 km, with the Aegean Sea to the south-west and the Black Sea to the north-east.\n\nQuestion: what two continents is turkey on?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Traditionally, Anatolia is considered to extend in the east to an indefinite line running from the Gulf of Alexandretta to the Black Sea, coterminous with the Anatolian Plateau. In 1941, with the First Geography Congress which divided Turkey into seven geographical regions based on differences in climate and landscape, the eastern provinces of Turkey were placed into the Eastern Anatolia \n\n  The Turkish Straits (Türk Boğazları) are two internationally significant waterways in northwestern Turkey. They consist of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. The straits are on opposite ends of the Sea of Marmara. Located in the western part of the landmass of Eurasia, the Straits are conventionally considered the boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia, as well as the dividing line between European Turkey and Asian Turkey. Owing to their strategic importance in international commerce, politics, and warfare, the Straits have played a significant role in European and world history. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian \n\n Turkey is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia – thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persian descent. This cultural influence mainly stems from the Iranian culture, which spread through multiple ways but mainly during the early modern period where Iranian and Ottoman contact flourished and the influence of the Kurds, an Iranian ethnic group, on Turkish culture. In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent Ottoman Empire. However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe. In the United Nations geopolitical Eastern European Group, Armenia and Georgia are included in Eastern Europe, whereas Cyprus and East Thracian Turkey are in Southern Europe. These three nations are listed in the European category of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). East Thrace has an area of 23,764 km2 (3 percent of Turkey's land area), slightly smaller than Sardinia, and a population of about 16-17 million people or about 20 percent of the total Turkish population (in 2021); the population density is around 430 people/km2, compared to about 80 people/km2 for Asiatic Turkey, which is also called Anatolia or Asia Minor. The two continents are separated by the Dardanelles, the Bosphorus (collectively known as the Turkish Straits) and the Sea of Marmara, a route of about 361 km. European Turkey is bordered on the west by Greece for 212 km and on the north by Bulgaria for 269 km, with the Aegean Sea to the south-west and the Black Sea to the north-east.\n\n"

Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home. Bring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. Medical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. Although it is not something many of us like to dwell on before traveling, having insurance is a good safe guard against much hardship if an emergency does unfortunately occur.

More broadly, money in circulation is the total money supply of a country, which can be defined in various ways, but always includes currency and also some types of bank deposits, such as deposits at call. The published amount of currency in circulation tends to be overstated by an unknown amount because it does not take into account money that has been destroyed, or held by individuals as a form of security (the proverbial “money under the mattress”), or by coin collectors, domestic or foreign, or which is held in reserve within the banking system, including currency held by foreign central banks as a foreign exchange reserve asset.\n\nQuestion: what currency should you take to morocco?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Centuries ago, Mahr and Sadaq meant something different in Morocco.

Although relatively safe, when traveling to anywhere in the world, I would advise taking certain precautions in the unlikely event something unexpected happens while abroad. Based on my recent travels to the Andean region of Peru, I have written out a few guidelines below to help ensure health and safety while enjoying your trip to Peru. Diamox 125- 250mg every 12 hours should be started at least 24 hours prior to departure for Cusco. Both can be purchased in country, but may be more expensive than simply bringing a bit from home. Bring your medications in your carry on luggage. Although most medications can be purchased in Peru, it is always better to be prepared. Medical evacuation from Peru could cost more than $50,000 without evacuation insurance. Although it is not something many of us like to dwell on before traveling, having insurance is a good safe guard against much hardship if an emergency does unfortunately occur.

Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight Nazis. If built, the German Stadium would have accommodated 400,000 spectators. Speer modified Werner March's design for the Olympic Stadium being built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. He added a stone exterior that pleased Hitler. Speer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris. Speer was involved virtually from the beginning. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the 4 entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column or Siegessäule, and the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, 46 ft high, was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures proposed as part of Welthauptstadt Germania, Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public. During the war, the Speer-designed Reich Chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin. Notwithstanding the practical limitations \n\n Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge domed assembly hall over 700 ft high, with floor space for 180,000 people. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the Prachtstrasse. Plans to build a \n\n  On 30 January 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the Prachtstrasse, or Street of Magnificence; he also referred to it as the \"North–South Axis\".\n\n"

Balls are held in the many palaces in Vienna, with the principal venue being the Hofburg Palace in Heldenplatz. While the Opera Ball is the best known internationally of all the Austrian balls, other balls such as the Kaffeesiederball (Cafe Owners Ball), the Jägerball (Hunter's Ball) and the Life Ball (AIDS charity event) are almost as well known within Austria and even better appreciated for their cordial atmosphere. Viennese of at least middle class may visit a number of balls in their lifetime. Dancers and opera singers from the Vienna State Opera often perform at the openings of the larger balls. A Vienna ball is an all-night cultural attraction. Major Vienna balls generally begin at 9 pm and last until 5 am, although many guests carry on the celebrations into the next day. Viennese balls are being exported (with support from the City of Vienna) to around 30 cities worldwide such as New York, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Rome, Prague, Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow.

Jordan moved from one coast to another and resettled in Los Angeles after his sophomore year in high school. He transferred to Cleveland High School in Reseda and joined future NBA veteran Lucious Harris as stars of the school's varsity basketball team. The New York \n\n Jordan was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1993 NBA Draft after a storied basketball career at Kansas. Jordan's legacy with Kansas is also recognized in holding the Jayhawks' number six spot for most assists in the school's history and is 22nd on the school's all-time scoring list. In the summer of 1984, the team's fortunes changed when it received the third pick of the NBA draft, after Houston and Portland. As a star at Southwestern High School in Detroit, where he was teammates with future NBA players Voshon Lenard and Howard Eisley, Rose obtained a high profile and can even be seen at a high school All-American camp in the documentary film Hoop Dreams. Rose attended the University of Michigan where the Wolverines reached two NCAA Finals games in 1992 and 1993, finishing as national runners up both times.

Hammer would later dance and read the lyrics to this song on the first VH1 Hip Hop Honors in 2004. According to the Family Affair album insert, \"Unconditional Love\" lyrics were written and arranged by 2Pac and the songs producer, Johnny \"J\". Hammer wrote this about the song: \"This song was given to me as a gift from the late Tupac Shakur. Thank you Tupac for this beautiful, spiritual song.\" Hammer would later go on to mention his friendship with Tupac and the gift of this song to him in a TBN interview. \"Pac's Life\" is a single written and performed by American rappers Tupac Shakur and T.I and R&B singer Ashanti, produced by L. T. Hutton for Shakur's posthumously released album of the same name. It is a hip hop and R&B song; the second Tupac verse was recycled from a song titled \"This Life I Lead\". In 1977, he published his first compilation of poems, \"Dance of the Head and the Rose\". In 1978, six of his poems were deemed morally dangerous and Zrika was sentenced to two years in prison. Apart from his career as a poet, Zrika also holds a degree in sociology. Recently released from several years of youth incarceration, Dresta had forged his rap skill through activities inside, whereby his reputation preceded him onto the streets. Visiting the brothers' house, Eazy's associate found Dresta and took him to the studio, where Eazy told him tales of Dre. Dresta, thereby forming the song concept, wrote all the lyrics for an Eazy and Dresta duet. And so Eazy's leading answer to Dre became \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's.\" The Vigil also honored who have died in jail and the thousands of people in L.A. jails. The idea was inspired by Tupac Shakur's poem entitled The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection). claimed that he was recording \"Nasty Boy\" when Tupac Shakur was shot in Las Vegas on September 7, 1996. Instead of traveling to Las Vegas for the Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon fight, he recorded his verse in the morning and saw the fight at home. Flowers's writing is characterized by blues-inspired lyricism and the incorporation of dialects and African-American Vernacular English. These invocations, by identifying Flowers himself as the narrator of his stories, also point to his interest in metafictional techniques. Flowers has termed his approach to his work \"literary hoodoo\". The Rose That Grew from Concrete is a posthumous album based on the poetry/writings of Tupac Shakur, released on November 21, 2000. This album features a large cast of celebrities reading Shakur's poetry and writing, much in the spirit of a traditional spoken word album. 2Pac is featured on the song \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\". He later declared the icons to be Tupac Shakur and Pimp C, along with Trey Songz singing the chorus.

According to the Family Affair album insert, \"Unconditional Love\" lyrics were written and arranged by 2Pac and the songs producer, Johnny \"J\". Hammer wrote this about the song: \"This song was given to me as a gift from the late Tupac Shakur. Thank you Tupac for this beautiful, spiritual song.\" Hammer would later go on to mention his friendship with Tupac and the gift of this song to him in a TBN interview. \"Pac's Life\" is a single written and performed by American rappers Tupac Shakur and T.I and R&B singer Ashanti, produced by L. T. Hutton for Shakur's posthumously released album of the same name. It is a hip hop and R&B song; the second Tupac verse was recycled from a song titled \"This Life I Lead\". In 1977, he published his first compilation of poems, \"Dance of the Head and the Rose\". In 1978, six of his poems were deemed morally dangerous and Zrika was sentenced to two years in prison. Apart from his career as a poet, Zrika also holds a degree in sociology. Recently released from several years of youth incarceration, Dresta had forged his rap skill through activities inside, whereby his reputation preceded him onto the streets. Visiting the brothers' house, Eazy's associate found Dresta and took him to the studio, where Eazy told him tales of Dre. Dresta, thereby forming the song concept, wrote all the lyrics for an Eazy and Dresta duet. And so Eazy's leading answer to Dre became \"Real Muthaphuckkin G's.\" The Vigil also honored who have died in jail and the thousands of people in L.A. jails. The idea was inspired by Tupac Shakur's poem entitled The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection). claimed that he was recording \"Nasty Boy\" when Tupac Shakur was shot in Las Vegas on September 7, 1996. Instead of traveling to Las Vegas for the Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon fight, he recorded his verse in the morning and saw the fight at home. Flowers's writing is characterized by blues-inspired lyricism and the incorporation of dialects and African-American Vernacular English. These invocations, by identifying Flowers himself as the narrator of his stories, also point to his interest in metafictional techniques. Flowers has termed his approach to his work \"literary hoodoo\". The Rose That Grew from Concrete is a posthumous album based on the poetry/writings of Tupac Shakur, released on November 21, 2000. This album features a large cast of celebrities reading Shakur's poetry and writing, much in the spirit of a traditional spoken word album. 2Pac is featured on the song \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\". He later declared the icons to be Tupac Shakur and Pimp C, along with Trey Songz singing the chorus.

Classes are held both online and at the University of Northern Colorado main campus in Greeley, CO.\n\n Around 2008, an opportunity arose in Denver, Colorado. Adventist Health System had four hospitals in the Denver area where they had been struggling to find qualified, mission-oriented healthcare providers. When the leaders of these institutions became aware of FHCHS and its ability to deliver distance education, they invited college administrators to offer classes in Denver.

As of 1 January 2021 its population was 2,962,180 making Kyiv the seventh-most populous city in Europe. Kyiv is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kyiv Metro. With a population of one million, it is one of the largest urban regions in Ukraine. From east to west, the region includes the cities of Kryvyi Rih, Zhovti Vody, Oleksandriia, Novyi Buh as well as parts of the more \"rural\" raions and (factually) includes far more territories in central and southern parts of Ukraine. The Kryvyi Rih metro area doesn't have an administrative center; each city in the area has its own administration.

Initially lasting between April 1992 and June 1992, it involved the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) fighting against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. That phase ended in June 1992 after the success of Operation Jackal, launched by the Croatian Army (HV) and HVO. As the wider conflict matured and the political landscape changed, the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks began to fight against each other, culminating in the Croat–Bosniak War. Between June 1993 and April 1994 the HVO besieged Bosniak-concentrated East Mostar, resulting in the deaths of numerous civilians, a cut off of humanitarian aid, damage or destruction of ten mosques, and the blowing up of the historic Stari Most bridge. Hostilities ended with the signing of the Washington Agreement in March 1994 and the establishment of the Croat–Bosniak federation. The VRS were backed by Yugoslavia, and the Bosnian Army by the newly-created Republic of Croatia as well as the unrecognized proto-state Herzeg-Bosnia. Crimes against civilians were committed on both sides. Most of the Bosniak and Croat atrocities were committed during the Croat–Bosniak War, a sub-conflict of the Bosnian War that pitted the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) against the HVO.\n\n"

Although Service Merchandise was early to embrace the Internet in the 1990s, generating tens of millions of dollars in sales, it was not enough to offset the damage done by the mega-chain stores springing up nationwide. The company responded to the market pressures with a series of restructuring plans that included the discontinuation of unprofitable product lines such as electronics, toys and sporting goods, and refocusing on jewelry, gifts, and home decor products. Many of their showrooms were also closed or downsized significantly.

Aldi has forced the other two to cut prices and increase their private label product ranges. For example, in 2009 51% of Wal-Mart's $251 billion domestic sales were recorded from grocery goods. In early 2014, Walmart, Inc purchased naming rights to the venue. They are generally regional rather than national in their company branding. Kroger is perhaps the most nationally oriented supermarket chain in the United States but it has preserved most of its regional brands, including Ralphs, City Market, King Soopers, Fry's, Smith's, and QFC. These three chains are subsidiaries of large retail companies which also have other kinds of business units, such as department stores and home improvement outlets. From 2016 to 2021, he was the President and CEO of Walmart U.S. eCommerce. He was appointed in September 2016 to lead Walmart's e-commerce division when his company Jet.com, an e-commerce website launched in 2014, was acquired by Walmart, Inc. Walmart purchased Jet for $3.3 billion. After stepping down from Walmart, Recode reported that Lore's next venture will be \"a multi-decade project to build 'a city of the future' supported by 'a reformed version of capitalism,'\" announced in September 2021 as Telosa. The company lost market share in its housewares and electronics sectors to giant discounters such as Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond, and later Best Buy and Circuit City. Although Service Merchandise was early to embrace the Internet in the 1990s, generating tens of millions of dollars in sales, it was not enough to offset the damage done by the mega-chain stores springing up nationwide. The company responded to the market pressures with a series of restructuring plans that included the discontinuation of unprofitable product lines such as electronics, toys and sporting goods, and refocusing on jewelry, gifts, and home decor products. Many of their showrooms were also closed or downsized significantly. During this time, the company was successful in sub-dividing a number of its company-owned stores into two or three units and sub-leasing the newly created spaces to other national chains, thus reducing costs and generating more store traffic.\n\n"

Beethoven's funeral was held three days later, and the procession was witnessed by a large crowd. Beethoven's last words and the exact cause of his death have also been the subject of some historical debate. The funeral was held on 29 March 1827 at the parish church in Alsergrund, and he was buried in the Währing cemetery, northwest of Vienna. In \n\n Beethoven eventually returned to Vienna permanently in 1792, the year after Mozart's death. In particular, like Mozart, Beethoven early established a strong reputation as a keyboard performer, was mentored by Joseph Haydn, and was given patronage by Countess Maria Wilhelmine Thun. Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. On the Prague phase of his journey, Beethoven composed an extended concert aria for the noted soprano Josepha Duschek, as Mozart had done on his visit in 1789. When he was around ten years old, he began studying with Theodor Leschetizky, who was a student of Carl Czerny, who was in turn Beethoven's student, close friend and assistant. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. ; Hans Christian Ørsted (1777–1851), Danish physicist \n\n Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, about 14 years after Mozart (born Salzburg, 1756).

One of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. By using alcohol as a tool, Rushdie explores the conflicts and tensions that emerge as India transitions from a colonized nation to an independent one. Another way Rushdie uses alcohol is to satirize and undermine the supposed benefits that Empire presented to India and its people. By depicting characters struggling with alcoholism, he challenges the notion that colonial rule brought progress and advancement to the country. Through the lens of alcohol, Rushdie critiques the exploitative nature of Empire and exposes the contradictions inherent in its claims of superiority. Furthermore, Rushdie's exploration of alcohol and alcoholism allows him to delve into the medical legacy of Empire.

Houstonia rosea, the rose bluet, is a North American plant species in the coffee family. It is a tiny plant only a few centimeters tall, with pink flowers. It is native to the south-central United States: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and southern Missouri. Touchardia latifolia, commonly known as olonā in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering shrub in the nettle family, Urticaceae. T. latifolia is endemic to Hawaii and inhabits mesic valleys and wet forests at elevations of 70 - 1200 m. Typical to many Hawaiian plants, the olonā does not have the stinging hairs of its mainland cousins. It is found on all the main Hawaiian islands except Kahoolawe and Niihau. Olonā has alternate leaves whose shape greatly varies depending upon the environment from thin lancolate to broad elliptic.

In \n\nHank Marvin – Lead Guitar, piano, vocals ; Bruce Welch – Rhythm guitar ; Tony Meehan – Drums ; Jet Harris – Bass guitar ; Norrie Paramor – Recording manager \n\n Shade first heard jug band music in 1925, recorded by the Dixieland Jug Blowers, from Louisville, Kentucky. He was excited by what he heard and felt that bringing this style of music to his hometown of Memphis could be promising. He persuaded a few local musicians, though still reluctant, to join him in creating one of the first jug bands in Memphis. The original Memphis Jug Band consisted of Shade and three others: Lionhouse, whom Shade converted from a whiskey bottle blower to a jug blower; Tee Wee Blackman on guitar; and Ben Ramey on kazoo. Shade played the guitar, the \"bullfiddle\" (washtub bass), and the harmonica, the instrument \n\n Daniel Joseph Anthony Meehan (2 March 1943 – 28 November 2005 ), professionally known as Tony Meehan, was a founder member of the British group The Drifters, with Jet Harris, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch, which would evolve into The Shadows.

Singer-guitarist Joe Brown had bought an Italian-built guitar echo chamber that he did not like and gave it to The Shadows' guitarist Hank Marvin, who developed a distinctive sound using it and the tremolo arm of his Fender Stratocaster. Bruce Welch borrowed an acoustic Gibson J-200 guitar from Cliff Richard, the heavy melodic bass was performed by Jet Harris, and drums by Tony Meehan. Richard himself played a Chinese drum at the beginning and end to provide an atmosphere of stereotypically Native American music. The core members from 1958 to present are Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch; Brian Bennett has been with the group since 1961.\n\n"

UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan cover about 70 operations throughout different parts of the world. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. The peacekeepers are allowed to use force to protect civilians and humanitarian operations. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through. The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty \n\nThe United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and advocating for global health initiatives. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN. These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. The UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. In summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all.

The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse.

UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan cover about 70 operations throughout different parts of the world. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. The peacekeepers are allowed to use force to protect civilians and humanitarian operations. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through. The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty \n\nThe United Nations (UN) plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and advocating for global health initiatives. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN. These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. The UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. In summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all. The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, and collects data on global health issues. The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse.

It would consist of United Nations and AMIS troops, numbering 19,555 troops, including 360 military observers and liaison officers, and 3,772 police personnel, including 19 police units of 140 officers. The resolution emphasised that there was no military solution to the conflict in Darfur. There was a need to focus on developmental initiatives such as reconstruction and development, compensation and the return of internally displaced persons to bring about peace in Darfur. Finally, the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was requested to report on the situation every 90 days, including the situation on the ground and the implementation of the peace process.\n\n"

Jackson selected Calhoun as his running mate, and together they defeated Adams and his running mate Richard Rush. The only other man who accomplished this feat was George Clinton, who served as vice president from 1805 to 1812 under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. During the election, Jackson's aide James Alexander Hamilton attempted a rapprochement between Jackson and Crawford, whom Jackson resented owing partially to \n\n by a split between Adams and Hamilton, the latter of whom led a faction of Federalists who favored declaring war on France. Adams fired Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, a Hamilton supporter, after Pickering tried to undermine peace negotiations with France. Adams directed Marshall to bring an end to the Quasi-War and settle ongoing disputes with Britain, Spain, and the Barbary States. Adams reluctantly signed the Alien and Sedition Acts designed to weaken the Republicans. However Adams broke with the Hamiltonian wing of his Federalist Party and made peace with France in 1800. Vice President John Adams, a member of the Federalist Party, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 presidential election and sought to continue Washington's policy of neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars. After Adams took office, France refused to meet with American envoys and began attacking American ships. He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without protection for the former slaves. This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. Among the contenders was William Jackson, a secretary to President Washington. Jackson asked Washington to advance his prospects by removing Otis from the scene—through an appointment to a federal post in Massachusetts. From 1789 to 1801—the period of Adams' eight years as Vice President, and four as President—Otis enjoyed great job security. The electoral \"Revolution of 1800\", which shifted control of Congress \n\n expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams. The presidency of John Adams, began on March 4, 1797, when John Adams was inaugurated as the second president of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1801. Adams, who had served as vice president under George Washington, took office as president after winning the 1796 presidential election. He was succeeded by Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic-Republican Party. When Adams entered office, the ongoing war between France and Great Britain was causing \n\n years, now Quincy).

Jackson selected Calhoun as his running mate, and together they defeated Adams and his running mate Richard Rush. The only other man who accomplished this feat was George Clinton, who served as vice president from 1805 to 1812 under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. During the election, Jackson's aide James Alexander Hamilton attempted a rapprochement between Jackson and Crawford, whom Jackson resented owing partially to \n\n by a split between Adams and Hamilton, the latter of whom led a faction of Federalists who favored declaring war on France. Adams fired Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, a Hamilton supporter, after Pickering tried to undermine peace negotiations with France. Adams directed Marshall to bring an end to the Quasi-War and settle ongoing disputes with Britain, Spain, and the Barbary States. Adams reluctantly signed the Alien and Sedition Acts designed to weaken the Republicans. However Adams broke with the Hamiltonian wing of his Federalist Party and made peace with France in 1800. Vice President John Adams, a member of the Federalist Party, defeated Jefferson in the 1796 presidential election and sought to continue Washington's policy of neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars. After Adams took office, France refused to meet with American envoys and began attacking American ships. He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without protection for the former slaves. This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. Among the contenders was William Jackson, a secretary to President Washington. Jackson asked Washington to advance his prospects by removing Otis from the scene—through an appointment to a federal post in Massachusetts. From 1789 to 1801—the period of Adams' eight years as Vice President, and four as President—Otis enjoyed great job security. The electoral \"Revolution of 1800\", which shifted control of Congress \n\n expressed some concerns, which caused friction between him and Adams. The presidency of John Adams, began on March 4, 1797, when John Adams was inaugurated as the second president of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1801. Adams, who had served as vice president under George Washington, took office as president after winning the 1796 presidential election.

As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which, in 1919, he called the \"hydrogen atom\" but, in 1920, he more accurately named the proton. After his death in 1937, he was buried in Westminster Abbey near Sir Isaac Newton.\n\n"

She was brought before Diocletian, who at first attempted to dissuade her and then placed her in a cauldron of burning pitch; Lucy lived for three days in the cauldron. When Diocletian heard that she was still alive, he ordered her to be carried around the city, with weights loaded on her body. When Lucy was paraded by Geminian's house, the statues of Roman gods in his home shattered miraculously and a dove made the sign of the cross over Geminian's head. He followed Lucy, asking for instruction in the Christian religion as well as baptism. 75 people were converted to Christianity by the example of Geminian. Lucy and Geminian were ultimately beheaded.
