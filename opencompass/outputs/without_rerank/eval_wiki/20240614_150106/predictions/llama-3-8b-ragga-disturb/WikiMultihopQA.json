The film features British architect Norman Foster, who called the car \"an incredibly beautiful aesthetic object\" and rebuilt the fourth Dymaxion car from drawings and study of the first three cars. In the film, noted automobile collector Jay Leno calls Buckminster Fuller a genius. Buckminster Fuller's advocacy for humanity permeates the film. Director Noel Murphy said describing \"Buckminster Fuller as a car designer would be like describing Jimi Hendrix as a guitar tech\".

Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini, two renowned Italian directors, had distinct life paths that led them to become influential figures in the history of cinema. Firstly, both Visconti and Fellini started their careers in the neorealist genre. Visconti's debut film \"Ossessione\" (1943) is considered one of the earliest neorealist works, while Fellini worked as a scriptwriter on neorealist films such as \"Rome, Open City\" (1945) before transitioning to his distinctive style. Visconti was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his exploration of Italian history and class struggles in films like \"The Leopard\" (1963). On the other hand, Fellini had a more fantastical and surrealistic style, often blending reality and dreams in films like \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960) and \"8½\" (1963). Furthermore, both Visconti and Fellini were politically and culturally involved in their work. While Visconti's films often had a more overt political message, Fellini's works focused on personal and societal reflections. Lastly, both directors experienced a neurological disease towards the end of their careers. Despite this, Visconti showed incredible resilience and continued to direct films and plays as an infirm. In summary, Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini had similarities in terms of their involvement in the neorealist genre, their distinctive personalities and creative styles, as well as their experiences with a right-hemispheric stroke towards the end of their careers.

Armen Dorian was born Hrachia Surenian in Sinop in the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire on 28 January 1892. Dorian moved to the capital Constantinople where he received his early education at the Pangaltı Mekhitarist Armenian School. After finishing his education, Dorian traveled to France in 1911 and continued his studies at the Sorbonne University in Paris. He joined the French literary scene and founded the French newspaper L'Arène. It was said of Dorian that \"symbolists during that time in France had never seen a youth with such a fervent vigor with a majestic writing style that incorporated such beautiful dreams...\" Immediately after his graduation from the Sorbonne in 1914, Dorian returned to Constantinople where he became a teacher and taught French and Armenian literature. Shehada was born in Kasbah Marmarita, the largest village in Wadi al-Nassari, Homs-Syria. He was fluent in both Arabic and French and began translating French as a teenager. He built a school in his village from the profits of the play \"The Master\" by the poet Pierre Corneille, which he had translated. (\"The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin, Son of Judge Simavne\", 1936) and Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları (\"Human Landscapes from My Country\", 1939), he developed a voice simultaneously proclamatory and subtle. The authors were Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, \"to explore the people's tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art\". To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French \n\n Philip Stratford (October 13, 1927 – April 23, 1999) was a Canadian translator, professor and poet. The poets of this movement, soon known as İkinci Yeni (\"Second New\", ) opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead—partly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as Dada and Surrealism—sought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. The most well-known poets writing in the \"Second New\" vein were Turgut Uyar (1927–1985), Edip Cansever (1928–1986), Cemal Süreya (1931–1990), Ece Ayhan (1931–2002), Sezai Karakoç \n\n He was orphaned at an early age. After attending one of the Galatasaray exhibitions, he developed an interest in art and eventually enrolled at the \"Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi\" (School of Fine Arts), where his instructors were Hikmet Onat and İbrahim Çallı. He attended the Académie Julian, where he worked with Paul Albert Laurens, and the Ecolé des Arts Décoratifs, where he studied sculpture with Paul \n\n According to the Finnish writer Tuomas Anhava, Sarkia occupies same position in the history of Finnish poetry that John Keats has in English and Alfred de Musset in French poetry. Sarkia has been described as a ″composer of words″ as his poems are known of their euphony and rhythm. Many of Sarkia's poems have been set to music, by composers like Erik Bergman and Kaj Chydenius. His poetry has even influenced on the lyrics of the Finnish death metal group Insomnium.

His grave is in Küplüce Cemetery in Beylerbeyi. Armen Dorian was born Hrachia Surenian in Sinop in the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire on 28 January 1892. Dorian moved to the capital Constantinople where he received his early education at the Pangaltı Mekhitarist Armenian School. After finishing his education, Dorian traveled to France in 1911 and continued his studies at the Sorbonne University in Paris. He joined the French literary scene and founded the French newspaper L'Arène. It was said of Dorian that \"symbolists during that time in France had never seen a youth with such a fervent vigor with a majestic writing style that incorporated such beautiful dreams...\" Immediately after his graduation from the Sorbonne in 1914, Dorian returned to Constantinople where he became a teacher and taught French and Armenian literature. Shehada was born in Kasbah Marmarita, the largest village in Wadi al-Nassari, Homs-Syria. He was fluent in both Arabic and French and began translating French as a teenager. He built a school in his village from the profits of the play \"The Master\" by the poet Pierre Corneille, which he had translated. (\"The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin, Son of Judge Simavne\", 1936) and Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları (\"Human Landscapes from My Country\", 1939), he developed a voice simultaneously proclamatory and subtle. The authors were Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, \"to explore the people's tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art\". To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French \n\n Philip Stratford (October 13, 1927 – April 23, 1999) was a Canadian translator, professor and poet. The poets of this movement, soon known as İkinci Yeni (\"Second New\", ) opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead—partly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as Dada and Surrealism—sought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. The most well-known poets writing in the \"Second New\" vein were Turgut Uyar (1927–1985), Edip Cansever (1928–1986), Cemal Süreya (1931–1990), Ece Ayhan (1931–2002), Sezai Karakoç \n\n He was orphaned at an early age. After attending one of the Galatasaray exhibitions, he developed an interest in art and eventually enrolled at the \"Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi\" (School of Fine Arts), where his instructors were Hikmet Onat and İbrahim Çallı. He attended the Académie Julian, where he worked with Paul Albert Laurens, and the Ecolé des Arts Décoratifs, where he studied sculpture with Paul \n\n According to the Finnish writer Tuomas Anhava, Sarkia occupies same position in the history of Finnish poetry that John Keats has in English and Alfred de Musset in French poetry. Sarkia has been described as a ″composer of words″ as his poems are known of their euphony and rhythm. Many of Sarkia's poems have been set to music, by composers like Erik Bergman and Kaj Chydenius. His poetry has even influenced on the lyrics of the Finnish death metal group Insomnium. Sarkia's translation of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal has been praised of its rich imagery and rhythmical experimentations. Sarkia's poems have never been published as a separate book in English.\n\n"

At the time of his birth, Ahmad was an-Nasir Muhammad's only son (three other sons had died before Ahmad was born) and the only son of an-Nasir Muhammad born to Bayad. Bayad and an-Nasir Muhammad later divorced and the former married Maliktamur al-Sarjuwani, an emir who became Ahmad's stepfather. As a youth, Ahmad spent frequent bouts of time in the desert fortress of al-Karak under orders from his father. His brother was Hafiz Zayn ad-Din who he later migrated with across Greater Khorasan to study Islamic theology and the natural sciences. He is said to have married at the age of 45 and had a daughter in Bukhara who locals refer to as Makhdum-e-Jahan. In circa 1270, Abu Tawwama and his family were requested by the Sultan to move to the city of Sonargaon in Bengal, where Islam was not properly settled among the populace. Her widower, Maliktamur, was appointed governor of al-Karak concurrent with Ahmad and Badri's arrival in Cairo. In 1332, Ahmad and his brother Abu Bakr, who had also been at al-Karak at the time, met an-Nasir Muhammad and the latter's favored son and Ahmad's much younger brother, Anuk, at the Red Sea town of Aqaba, south of al-Karak. From there, they were to accompany their father to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage, but at the last minute, an-Nasir Muhammad sent Ahmad, Abu Bakr and Anuk to al-Karak under Maliktamur's care. Nothing is known about Ahmad's life between the latter event \n\n He was born in 932 or in 933, probably in Iraq and specifically in Baghdad, as his father Abi'l-Ala Sa'id—a son of the Hamdanid family's founder, Hamdan ibn Hamdun—occupied a distinguished position in the court of the Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadir (reigned 908–932). His maternal descent later was a source of scorn and taunts from his Hamdanid relatives, a fact reflected in his poems. His father was killed in 935, during a dispute over possession of Mosul with his nephew, Nasir al-Dawla, and Abu Firas's mother fled to the protection of Nasir al-Dawla's brother, \n\n Marzuban ibn Bakhtiyar was a Buyid prince, and the son of the Buyid ruler of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar. In 970, he married a daughter of the Turkish officer Bukhtakin Azadruwayh. In 975, he received the title of \"I'zaz al-Dawla\" (\"Fortification of the Empire\"), while several other of his family members and officers received other titles.

At the time of his birth, Ahmad was an-Nasir Muhammad's only son (three other sons had died before Ahmad was born) and the only son of an-Nasir Muhammad born to Bayad. Bayad and an-Nasir Muhammad later divorced and the former married Maliktamur al-Sarjuwani, an emir who became Ahmad's stepfather. As a youth, Ahmad spent frequent bouts of time in the desert fortress of al-Karak under orders from his father. His brother was Hafiz Zayn ad-Din who he later migrated with across Greater Khorasan to study Islamic theology and the natural sciences. He is said to have married at the age of 45 and had a daughter in Bukhara who locals refer to as Makhdum-e-Jahan. In circa 1270, Abu Tawwama and his family were requested by the Sultan to move to the city of Sonargaon in Bengal, where Islam was not properly settled among the populace. Her widower, Maliktamur, was appointed governor of al-Karak concurrent with Ahmad and Badri's arrival in Cairo. In 1332, Ahmad and his brother Abu Bakr, who had also been at al-Karak at the time, met an-Nasir Muhammad and the latter's favored son and Ahmad's much younger brother, Anuk, at the Red Sea town of Aqaba, south of al-Karak. From there, they were to accompany their father to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage, but at the last minute, an-Nasir Muhammad sent Ahmad, Abu Bakr and Anuk to al-Karak under Maliktamur's care.

His maternal descent later was a source of scorn and taunts from his Hamdanid relatives, a fact reflected in his poems.

A sign of their marriage is visible today in the twin churches of Santa Maria Incoronata in Milan. At the age of 20 she married Marc Antonio Michiel on 25 October 1775. Though she only stayed one year she made a profound impression on the Roman society and was given the nickname Venerina Veneziana, Venetian Venus. It was during this trip that Giustina gave birth to a daughter in 1776, Elena. They had two other daughters who were born over the course of the next two years, Cecilia and Chiara (died at age ten).

Camilla had a daughter with Cosimo in 1568, Virginia, but she was always resented by the children from Cosimo's first marriage. Despite their opposition, Cosimo married Camilla in 1570, at the explicit order of Pope Pius V. However, the marriage was morganatic, \n\n support the local university. The relationship between Gian Galeazzo and the French royal family, interrupted by his first wife Isabelle's death, was revived by their daughter Valentina. The three sons of Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle died before reaching adulthood. Gian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: Giovanni Maria in 1388 and Filippo Maria in 1392.

The situation differed from the previous one as this time Caterina had the approval of her children and she also obtained the consent of her uncle. In April 1498, Caterina bore Giovanni a son, the last of her children. Before the marriage occurred, Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who instigated the marriage, sent agents to Guastalla to ascertain her physical appearance. Building on the Facino's foundation, he reconstructed a state that began to compare of that of his father, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, before it fell apart under his brother Giovanni's rule. However, despite the wealth, territory, and military strength that she had brought to him, Filippo grew averse to Beatrice, perhaps because of jealousy of her late husband's reputation, or her own political power, or her greater age, or that she bore no children, or his favoring of his mistress, the much younger Agnese del Maino. He was the eldest son of Stefano Visconti and Valentina Doria. His uncle Luchino Visconti exiled him to Montferrat in 1346, but in 1350 returned to Milan. Part of his initiatives were the marriages of his nephews to members of the nearby noble dynasties of northern Italy: in 1340 Matteo II to Egidiola Gonzaga, in 1350 Bernabò to Regina Della Scala and Galeazzo II to Bianca of Savoy. In the same year, his brother Filippo Maria married the widow of Facino Cane, the 42-year-old Beatrice of Tenda, taking advantage of a testamentary disposition in favour of any Visconti that would have married her.\n\n"

The film is a part of the Marseille Trilogy which includes the films Fanny (Marius's ex-fiancée) and César (Marius's father). The film was selected to be screened in the Cannes Classics section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. The film was made by Korda for the French subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. I Confess was followed by three colour films starring Grace Kelly: Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), and To Catch a Thief (1955). In Dial M for Murder, Ray Milland plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money. Her lover, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), and Police Inspector Hubbard (John Williams) save her from execution. Hitchcock experimented with 3D cinematography for Dial M for Murder. Hitchcock collaborated with Grace Kelly on three films: Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954) and To Catch a Thief (1955). Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. In 1931, Marcel Pagnol filmed the first of his great trilogy Marius, Fanny, and César. In 1935, renowned playwright and actor Sacha Guitry directed his first film and went on to make more than 30 films that were precursors to \n\n shadow (Novak).

The film takes place mostly in the waterfront bar of César, Marius's father. Marius works in the bar and his good friend since childhood, Fanny, works outside the bar selling cockles.

She is also close to retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony M.

Huma Mahmood Abedin (born July 28, 1976) is an American political staffer who was vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for President of the United States. Prior to that, Abedin was deputy chief of staff to Clinton when she was U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. She was also the traveling chief of staff and former assistant for Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election. During Hillary Clinton's tenure at the State Department and her presidential campaign, Abedin became one of Clinton's closest aides. Mercer, along with her father, contributed $25 million to the 2016 presidential election. The Mercers stood behind Trump after the famous Access Hollywood tape was leaked in late 2016, dismissing Trump's claim of grabbing women's genitals against their will as \"locker room braggadocio.\" A letter to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, mentioned the Deputy Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence. The letter said that Abedin, wife of former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, who had access to sensitive national security and policy information, \"has three family members–her late father, her mother and her brother–connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations\", as backed up by a study by the Center \n\n Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton ( Rodham; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer, and public speaker who served as the 67th United States secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, as a United States senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, and as first lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001 as the wife of President Bill Clinton. Clinton won the popular vote in the election, making her the first woman to do \n\n While a student at George Washington University, Abedin began working as an intern in the White House in 1996, assigned to then–First Lady Hillary Clinton. From 1996 to 2008, she was an assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. She officially took over as Clinton's aide and personal advisor during Clinton's successful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign in New York and later worked as traveling chief of staff and \"body woman\" during Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. According to a number of Clinton associates, Abedin is a trusted advisor to Clinton, particularly on the Middle East, and has become known for that expertise. Starting in 2015, Abedin served as vice chairperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for president, while also continuing to serve as personal assistant to Clinton. In her role as the campaign's vice chairperson, she screened and interviewed applicants for key campaign roles, including campaign manager Robby Mook, and was the primary channel for communications to Clinton before the campaign officially began.

Huma Mahmood Abedin (born July 28, 1976) is an American political staffer who was vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for President of the United States. Prior to that, Abedin was deputy chief of staff to Clinton when she was U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. She was also the traveling chief of staff and former assistant for Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election. During Hillary Clinton's tenure at the State Department and her presidential campaign, Abedin became one of Clinton's closest aides. Mercer, along with her father, contributed $25 million to the 2016 presidential election. The Mercers stood behind Trump after the famous Access Hollywood tape was leaked in late 2016, dismissing Trump's claim of grabbing women's genitals against their will as \"locker room braggadocio.\" A letter to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, mentioned the Deputy Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence.

Clinton won the popular vote in the election, making her the first woman to do \n\n While a student at George Washington University, Abedin began working as an intern in the White House in 1996, assigned to then–First Lady Hillary Clinton. From 1996 to 2008, she was an assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. She officially took over as Clinton's aide and personal advisor during Clinton's successful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign in New York and later worked as traveling chief of staff and \"body woman\" during Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. According to a number of Clinton associates, Abedin is a trusted advisor to Clinton, particularly on the Middle East, and has become known for that expertise. Starting in 2015, Abedin served as vice chairperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for president, while also continuing to serve as personal assistant to Clinton. In her role as the campaign's vice chairperson, she screened and interviewed applicants for key campaign roles, including campaign manager Robby Mook, and was the primary channel for communications to Clinton before the campaign officially began. After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States, she wrote an email to Clinton supporters calling herself \"a proud Muslim\" and criticized Trump's plan as \"literally (writing) racism into our law books\".\n\n"

The lake is home to a variety of game fish including crappie, carp, sunfish, flathead and channel catfish, and smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. Until recently, Lake Roosevelt also hosted the state's most significant population of the federally endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. Since the lake's rise following heavy rains in the winter of 2005, the population dynamics between this site and the other significant Arizona population (on the San Pedro River) are unclear. The Lake is home to the Grapevine Airstrip, a small general aviation recreational airstrip located a quarter mile from the shore. The lake has also seen what appears to be a successful reintroduction of the Lahontan cutthroat trout, which were fished to extinction in the Lake Tahoe area in the twenties and thirties. Caples lake is found in the Eldorado National Forest so there are a variety of different recreational opportunities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing within close proximity. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has reports of stocking Caples lake with fish for recreational fishing dating back to 1930. Currently, the regulations for Caples lake state that fishermen are only allowed to take home five trout that are a minimum of ten inches each. Both the CDFW and the EID stock Caples lake with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Caples lake also supports a few non-stocked species such as the Lahontan redsides (Richardsonius egregius), the tui chub (Gila bicolor), and the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). There is year-round fishing at Caples lake, boat access in the summer and ice-fishing in the winter. There are also many trailheads located nearby Caples Lake that enter into the Mokelumne Wilderness. The names of the trailheads are lake margaret trailhead, meiss lake trailhead, thunder mountain trailhead, frog lake/roundtop trailhead, shealor lake trailhead. The access for these trailheads are along Highway 88 which is also how you access Caples lake.

The lake is home to a variety of game fish including crappie, carp, sunfish, flathead and channel catfish, and smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. Until recently, Lake Roosevelt also hosted the state's most significant population of the federally endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. Since the lake's rise following heavy rains in the winter of 2005, the population dynamics between this site and the other significant Arizona population (on the San Pedro River) are unclear. The Lake is home to the Grapevine Airstrip, a small general aviation recreational airstrip located a quarter mile from the shore. The lake has also seen what appears to be a successful reintroduction of the Lahontan cutthroat trout, which were fished to extinction in the Lake Tahoe area in the twenties and thirties. Caples lake is found in the Eldorado National Forest so there are a variety of different recreational opportunities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing within close proximity. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has reports of stocking Caples lake with fish for recreational fishing dating back to 1930. Currently, the regulations for Caples lake state that fishermen are only allowed to take home five trout that are a minimum of ten inches each. Both the CDFW and the EID stock Caples lake with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Caples lake also supports a few non-stocked species such as the Lahontan redsides (Richardsonius egregius), the tui chub (Gila bicolor), and the lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). There is year-round fishing at Caples lake, boat access in the summer and ice-fishing in the winter. There are also many trailheads located nearby Caples Lake that enter into the Mokelumne Wilderness. The names of the trailheads are lake margaret trailhead, meiss lake trailhead, thunder mountain trailhead, frog lake/roundtop trailhead, shealor lake trailhead. The access for these trailheads are along Highway 88 which is also how you access Caples lake.

The AAAS also publishes the famous science journal Science, the similar name leading to some confusion. Science was first issued as Science 80 in November 1979 and was originally published bi-monthly and by subscription only. The name of the magazine changed every year to reflect the publication date, becoming Science 81, Science 82, etc. The magazine was similar to Discover in terms of coverage, but tended to offer longer articles and often a photoessay. Guest essays by a well-known scientist were a common feature as \n\n Knowledge: An Illustrated Magazine of Science was a British popular science magazine published from 1881 to 1918. Founded by astronomer Richard A. Proctor, the magazine started as a weekly periodical, becoming monthly in 1885. The magazine was known for its extensive correspondence columns. Proctor himself, the first editor, was a significant contributor, and many of his discoveries or theoretical deductions first appeared in the magazine. After Proctor's death in 1888, Arthur Cowper Ranyard took over editorship, then Harry Forbes Witherby after Ranyard's death. The American Museum (also known as, 'The American Museum; or Repository of Ancient and Modern Fugitive Pieces &c. Prose and Poetical and The American Museum, or, Universal Magazine') was a monthly American literary magazine published by Mathew Carey in the late-18th century. Carey established the magazine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, using $400 that was given to him by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. The magazine reprinted significant historical documents of American history and also some original work. In its first edition, The American \n\n The Society for Amateur Scientists was the brainchild of Shawn Carlson, Ph.D, a physicist from the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Particle Astrophysics. Inspired by the example of his grandfather, a gifted amateur scientist named George Donald Graham, Carlson founded SAS in San Diego, California on January 1, 1994. Members of the founding Board of Trustees included Nobel Prize winner Glenn Seaborg and Guggenheim Fellowship winner Paul MacCready. Dr. Carlson led the organization for 16 years until he closed it to pursue other interests in science education. In 1995, Scientific American magazine tapped Carlson, due to his leadership in the citizen scientist community, to write their long running column The Amateur Scientist. During the six years \n\nThe mission of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is to promote cooperation among scientists, defend scientific freedom, encourage scientific responsibility, and support scientific education and outreach for the betterment of humanity.

This meeting serves as a forum for exchanging ideas, discussing current research breakthroughs, and addressing important issues in science. For the lavish convenience, these Trade\n\n In its early years, Scribner's Monthly published a regular feature titled \"Nature and Science.\" Remaining consistent with its broad mission to educate the public, The Century published articles by some of the most prominent scientists and inventors of the day. In the June 1900 issue, Nikola Tesla contributed a long article on \"the problem of increasing human energy.\" In a piece that combined the magazine's interests in political and scientific issues, geneticist and Marxist J.B.S. Haldane published a 1923 article on the societal implications of technological progress. The magazine also offered a \"Resources\" section which contained references for the articles. Like Discover, Science was aimed at readers looking for something more readable than the Scientific American of those days, which was a much more technical magazine than it became in the 1990s, but more in-depth and more artfully written than magazines like Popular Science, which tends to cover technology more than the science behind it. This market proved to be too small for the large number of magazines that attempted to serve it, and many disappeared during the mid-1980s. Science was purchased in 1986 by Time Inc. and folded into Discover, the last issue being July 1986. A few issues of Discover after the merger feature a stamp noting \"Now including Science 86\", but this quickly disappeared. American Scientist (informally abbreviated AmSci) is an American bimonthly science and technology magazine published since 1913 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society. In the beginning of 2000s the headquarters was in New Haven, CT. Each issue includes feature articles written by prominent scientists and engineers who review research in fields from molecular biology to computer engineering. American Scientist Online was launched in May 2003. Some key features and activities of FASEB include representing over 130,000 researchers, advocating for scientific funding and policy issues related to the life sciences, organizing scientific meetings and research conferences, publishing The FASEB Journal, and providing association management services. Another notable activity of FASEB is publishing The FASEB Journal.

Science was first issued as Science 80 in November 1979 and was originally published bi-monthly and by subscription only. The name of the magazine changed every year to reflect the publication date, becoming Science 81, Science 82, etc. The magazine was similar to Discover in terms of coverage, but tended to offer longer articles and often a photoessay. Guest essays by a well-known scientist were a common feature as \n\n Knowledge: An Illustrated Magazine of Science was a British popular science magazine published from 1881 to 1918. Founded by astronomer Richard A. Proctor, the magazine started as a weekly periodical, becoming monthly in 1885. The magazine was known for its extensive correspondence columns. Proctor himself, the first editor, was a significant contributor, and many of his discoveries or theoretical deductions first appeared in the magazine. After Proctor's death in 1888, Arthur Cowper Ranyard took over editorship, then Harry Forbes Witherby after Ranyard's death. The American Museum (also known as, 'The American Museum; or Repository of Ancient and Modern Fugitive Pieces &c. Prose and Poetical and The American Museum, or, Universal Magazine') was a monthly American literary magazine published by Mathew Carey in the late-18th century. Carey established the magazine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, using $400 that was given to him by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. The magazine reprinted significant historical documents of American history and also some original work. In its first edition, The American \n\n The Society for Amateur Scientists was the brainchild of Shawn Carlson, Ph.D, a physicist from the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Particle Astrophysics. Inspired by the example of his grandfather, a gifted amateur scientist named George Donald Graham, Carlson founded SAS in San Diego, California on January 1, 1994. Members of the founding Board of Trustees included Nobel Prize winner Glenn Seaborg and Guggenheim Fellowship winner Paul MacCready. Dr. Carlson led the organization for 16 years until he closed it to pursue other interests in science education. In 1995, Scientific American magazine tapped Carlson, due to his leadership in the citizen scientist community, to write their long running column The Amateur Scientist. During the six years \n\nThe mission of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is to promote cooperation among scientists, defend scientific freedom, encourage scientific responsibility, and support scientific education and outreach for the betterment of humanity. Annual Meeting: AAAS organizes an annual meeting that brings together thousands of scientists, policymakers, educators, and journalists from around the world. This meeting serves as a forum for exchanging ideas, discussing current research breakthroughs, and addressing important issues in science. For the lavish convenience, these Trade\n\n In its early years, Scribner's Monthly published a regular feature titled \"Nature and Science.\" Remaining consistent with its broad mission to educate the public, The Century published articles by some of the most prominent scientists and inventors of the day. In the June 1900 issue, Nikola Tesla contributed a long article on \"the problem of increasing human energy.\" In a piece that combined the magazine's interests in political and scientific issues, geneticist and Marxist J.B.S. Haldane published a 1923 article on the societal implications of technological progress. The magazine also offered a \"Resources\" section which contained references for the articles. Like Discover, Science was aimed at readers looking for something more readable than the Scientific American of those days, which was a much more technical magazine than it became in the 1990s, but more in-depth and more artfully written than magazines like Popular Science, which tends to cover technology more than the science behind it. This market proved to be too small for the large number of magazines that attempted to serve it, and many disappeared during the mid-1980s. Science was purchased in 1986 by Time Inc. and folded into Discover, the last issue being July 1986. A few issues of Discover after the merger feature a stamp noting \"Now including Science 86\", but this quickly disappeared. American Scientist (informally abbreviated AmSci) is an American bimonthly science and technology magazine published since 1913 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society. In the beginning of 2000s the headquarters was in New Haven, CT. Each issue includes feature articles written by prominent scientists and engineers who review research in fields from molecular biology to computer engineering. American Scientist Online was launched in May 2003. Some key features and activities of FASEB include representing over 130,000 researchers, advocating for scientific funding and policy issues related to the life sciences, organizing scientific meetings and research conferences, publishing The FASEB Journal, and providing association management services. Another notable activity of FASEB is publishing The FASEB Journal. In conclusion, some key features and activities of FASEB include representing researchers in the life sciences field, advocating for funding and policy issues related to science, organizing scientific meetings and conferences, publishing The FASEB Journal to disseminate research findings,and providing association management services to affiliated societies.\n\n"

My Friend Dahmer is a 2017 American biographical psychological drama film written and directed by Marc Meyers about American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. The film is based on the 2012 graphic novel of the same name by cartoonist John \"Derf\" Backderf, who had been friends with Dahmer in high school in the 1970s, until the time Dahmer began his killing spree in 1978. The film stars Ross Lynch as Dahmer, Alex Wolff as Derf, Dallas Roberts as Jeffrey's father, and Anne Heche as Jeffrey's mother. The film was critically acclaimed by critics, who praised the historical accuracy and Lynch's performance. The script is based on real incident: Father, mother and daughter of the japanese family Tsuda were killed October 4, 1987 in a hit-and-run accident on Bundesstrasse 17, near the \"Red Spot\" shown on maps in the movie. There is a memorial stone by the street where the accident once happened. The memorial stone shown in the film is a different stone, having the same text, but different dates and names on it. The film was written by Arash Amel and features Jamie Dornan, Tom Hollander and Stanley Tucci. At the 76th Golden Globe Awards, the film earned nominations for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Pike) and Best Original Song (\"Requiem for A Private War\"), while director Matthew Heineman received a nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement of a First Time Feature Film Director from the Directors Guild of America.

The verse &ndash; sometimes also known as \"She Is Gone\" &ndash; has often been given an anonymous attribution, but Harkins claimed his original authorship after it was chosen by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the funeral ceremony for her mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in April 2002. The film was written by Arash Amel and features Jamie Dornan, Tom Hollander, and Stanley Tucci.

The book \" Palazzi & Casate di Parma\" states that Pietro and his family lived in 5 Borgo Colonne (Casa Hotz) in central Parma. This appears to be incorrect since the census records all indicate that the family lived at 7 Borgo Colonne. The census of 1809 indicates Pietro aged 45 and Amalia aged 22 living in 7, Borgo Colonne with their son Giuseppe aged 1, together with Pietro's father Giuseppe and \n\n himself in many engagements, but in 1501 he advanced against Florence, moved as much by a desire to avenge his brother Paolo, who while in the service of the Republic, had been suspected of treachery and put to death (1499), as by Cesare's orders. Vitellozzo Vitelli wanted revenge for his brother's death. His father was a director of a factory of ceramic decoration. He moved to Rome as a young man, and was patronized by Pope Gregory XVI. Among his major works in Rome are:\n\n Annie Day was the daughter of a Melbourne merchant, Francis John Day, and his wife, Margaret Tilley. Vitelli studied music in Melbourne, Australia, where around 1855 she married her teacher, Giovanni Whittle Vitelli (d. 1859). Vitelli and her husband were regarded highly. Vitelli retired in 1882 and worked as a music teacher in Australia. Più recentemente è stata fatta l'ipotesi che la tavola fosse pensata per la cappella Cesi, in Santa Maria della Pace : in quel caso la pala sarebbe finita al Tornabuoni solo dopo la risoluzione del contratto con Angelo Cesi, magari per una nuova sistemazione architettonica della cappella che richiedeva una tavola di dimensioni maggiori; non è d'altronde da escludere che l'opera, nella sua modernità, fosse stata rifiutata, come era avvenuto per altri lavori dell'artista. Vitelli was born in 1531 in Città di Castello of Captain Alessandro Vitellozzi, signore of Amatrice, and Angela di Troilo Rossi, and educated at the University of Padua. and a member of the Born in Meiningen, Germany, Otto studied medicine in Augsburg, Germany before moving to Pennsylvania. With Joanna, he fathered three children: Sophia (died age 2), Rebecca (1765–1828), and Sophia Magdelene (1769–1810).\n\n"

Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her.

When Dr. Eileen de Villa was a medical student doing hospital rotations in the late 1990s, she came face to face with the horrors afflicting Toronto’s most vulnerable people. De Villa’s eyes well up at the memories. Decades later, de Villa now has a vastly expanded role: As the city’s new medical officer of health, she is responsible for the well-being of 2.8 million Torontonians. De Villa took over Canada’s largest municipal public health unit in late March. It is a notion that echoes the values imbued in her as a child. Although de Villa had a privileged upbringing, her parents — Toronto cardiologist Dr. Maria Antonina “Nenette” de Villa, and her late father, Dr. Guillermo “Jun” de Villa, an obstetrician/gynecologist — drilled into her and brother Joey the importance of helping the less fortunate. “I was raised in a household where the general teaching was, ‘You’ve been a very fortunate person; you’ve been afforded a great opportunity.’ And the expectation is to give back,” de Villa says during an interview at Toronto Public Health headquarters near Yonge and Dundas Sts.

In 1975, with the Philippines under martial law and the iron-fist rule of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the de Villas fled to Canada. De Villa’s father joined a local anti-Marcos group in 1983 following the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. “These issues in the Philippines were front and centre in the minds of people here,” de Villa recalls.

When Dr. Eileen de Villa was a medical student doing hospital rotations in the late 1990s, she came face to face with the horrors afflicting Toronto’s most vulnerable people. De Villa’s eyes well up at the memories. Decades later, de Villa now has a vastly expanded role: As the city’s new medical officer of health, she is responsible for the well-being of 2.8 million Torontonians. De Villa took over Canada’s largest municipal public health unit in late March. It is a notion that echoes the values imbued in her as a child. Although de Villa had a privileged upbringing, her parents — Toronto cardiologist Dr. Maria Antonina “Nenette” de Villa, and her late father, Dr. Guillermo “Jun” de Villa, an obstetrician/gynecologist — drilled into her and brother Joey the importance of helping the less fortunate. “I was raised in a household where the general teaching was, ‘You’ve been a very fortunate person; you’ve been afforded a great opportunity.’ And the expectation is to give back,” de Villa says during an interview at Toronto Public Health headquarters near Yonge and Dundas Sts. Her childhood was filled with lively dinner table discussions about political tumult in the Philippines, the birthplace of her parents and older brother. Although de Villa was born in Boston — her parents had travelled to the U.S. for their medical residencies — the family returned to the Philippines in 1972. Her father had a large extended family there and wanted his kids to think of the country as home. In 1975, with the Philippines under martial law and the iron-fist rule of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the de Villas fled to Canada. De Villa’s father joined a local anti-Marcos group in 1983 following the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. “These issues in the Philippines were front and centre in the minds of people here,” de Villa recalls. By the early 1990s, de Villa’s mind was on her own career. She had completed a bachelor of science at McGill University, but the next step weighed heavily\n\n Diaz was born in Quezon City in 1955.

The film tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s to Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug kingpin. Rather than being a new adaptation based on the novel, the film is primarily a remake and major modernization of the 1932 film. Sleeping Beauty (Italian: La bella addormentata) is a 1942 Italian drama film directed by Luigi Chiarini and starring Luisa Ferida, Amedeo Nazzari and Osvaldo Valenti. The film was screened at the 1942 Venice Film Festival. It belongs to the movies of the calligrafismo style. Chinese monarch Puyi, was a critical and commercial success, earning rave reviews and sweeping the 60th Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director). His 1996 film, Stealing Beauty, brought him his second of two Palme d'Or nominations. Bertolucci's films often deal with themes of politics, sexuality, history, class conflict, and social taboos; marked by a sensual, colorful visual style that's proved influential to filmmakers around the world. The film features a cameo appearance by jazz musician Dexter Gordon (who died before the film's release) and Bradley Whitford, Peter Stormare, Vin Diesel, and Vincent Pastore. With this goal in mind, he attended the Faculty of Modern Literature of the University of Rome from 1958 to 1961, where his film career as an assistant director to Pasolini began. In 1962, at the age of 22, he directed his first feature film, produced by Tonino Cervi with a screenplay by Pasolini, called La commare secca (1962). The film is a murder mystery, following a prostitute's homicide. Bertolucci uses flashbacks to piece together the crime and the person who committed it. The film which shortly followed was his acclaimed Before the Revolution \n\n Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. His prominent films include mainstream box office hits such as Carrie (1976), Dressed to Kill (1980), Scarface (1983), The Untouchables (1987), and Mission: Impossible (1996), as well as cult favorites such as Sisters (1972), Phantom of the Paradise (1974), Blow Out (1981), Body Double (1984), Casualties of War (1989), Carlito's Way (1993), Femme Fatale (2002), and Passion (2012). De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the New Hollywood generation of film directors. His directing style often makes use of quotations from other films or cinematic styles, and bears the influence of filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock and Jean-Luc Godard. His films have been criticized for their violence and sexual content but have also been championed by prominent American critics such as Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael. The film uses no new on-camera interviews, instead relying primarily on archival interviews, press kit footage, in-progress and completed footage from the films being covered, and personal film/videos shot (often against company policy) by the employees of the animation studio. The film, based on the 1934 play The Red Cat by Rudolph Lothar and Hans Adler, is a story of mistaken identity, with Maurice Chevalier playing both a music-hall star and a business \n\n Mastrantonio first appeared on screen in Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983) as Gina, sister of Al Pacino's Tony Montana. The film stars Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy García, Robert De Niro, and Sean Connery, and follows Eliot Ness (Costner) as he forms the Untouchables team to bring Al Capone (De Niro) to justice during Prohibition.\n\nQuestion: Which film has the director born earlier, Mister Scarface or Waking Sleeping Beauty?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s to Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug kingpin. Rather than being a new adaptation based on the novel, the film is primarily a remake and major modernization of the 1932 film. Sleeping Beauty (Italian: La bella addormentata) is a 1942 Italian drama film directed by Luigi Chiarini and starring Luisa Ferida, Amedeo Nazzari and Osvaldo Valenti. The film was screened at the 1942 Venice Film Festival. It belongs to the movies of the calligrafismo style. Chinese monarch Puyi, was a critical and commercial success, earning rave reviews and sweeping the 60th Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director). His 1996 film, Stealing Beauty, brought him his second of two Palme d'Or nominations. Bertolucci's films often deal with themes of politics, sexuality, history, class conflict, and social taboos; marked by a sensual, colorful visual style that's proved influential to filmmakers around the world. The film features a cameo appearance by jazz musician Dexter Gordon (who died before the film's release) and Bradley Whitford, Peter Stormare, Vin Diesel, and Vincent Pastore. With this goal in mind, he attended the Faculty of Modern Literature of the University of Rome from 1958 to 1961, where his film career as an assistant director to Pasolini began. In 1962, at the age of 22, he directed his first feature film, produced by Tonino Cervi with a screenplay by Pasolini, called La commare secca (1962). The film is a murder mystery, following a prostitute's homicide. Bertolucci uses flashbacks to piece together the crime and the person who committed it. The film which shortly followed was his acclaimed Before the Revolution \n\n Brian Russell De Palma (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. His prominent films include mainstream box office hits such as Carrie (1976), Dressed to Kill (1980), Scarface (1983), The Untouchables (1987), and Mission: Impossible (1996), as well as cult favorites such as Sisters (1972), Phantom of the Paradise (1974), Blow Out (1981), Body Double (1984), Casualties of War (1989), Carlito's Way (1993), Femme Fatale (2002), and Passion (2012). De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the New Hollywood generation of film directors. His directing style often makes use of quotations from other films or cinematic styles, and bears the influence of filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock and Jean-Luc Godard. His films have been criticized for their violence and sexual content but have also been championed by prominent American critics such as Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael. The film uses no new on-camera interviews, instead relying primarily on archival interviews, press kit footage, in-progress and completed footage from the films being covered, and personal film/videos shot (often against company policy) by the employees of the animation studio. The film, based on the 1934 play The Red Cat by Rudolph Lothar and Hans Adler, is a story of mistaken identity, with Maurice Chevalier playing both a music-hall star and a business \n\n Mastrantonio first appeared on screen in Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983) as Gina, sister of Al Pacino's Tony Montana. The film stars Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy García, Robert De Niro, and Sean Connery, and follows Eliot Ness (Costner) as he forms the Untouchables team to bring Al Capone (De Niro) to justice during Prohibition.\n\n"

Ward and starring John Goodman, Peter O'Toole, and John Hurt. Very little of the story survived the transition to the screen; characters were changed and the story made into a comedy. The Mayor of Casterbridge is a 1921 British silent drama film directed by Sidney Morgan and starring Fred Groves, Pauline Peters and Warwick Ward. It was an adaptation of the 1886 novel The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy and was made with Hardy's collaboration. Since then the city had been in decline until Buttigieg becomes its mayor. The film follows Pete Buttigieg as he runs for the President of the United States, campaigning to become the country's first gay president. The film begins one year before the 2020 Iowa caucuses, which Buttigieg won, marking the peak of his presidential campaign. “Why has that not \n\n The movie is a series pilot and sequel to Lane Slate's 1973 movie They Only Kill Their Masters. In that film, set in a beach community, James Garner portrayed Police Chief Abel Marsh. In 1977, Griffith appeared in two additional television movies (The Girl in the Empty Grave and Deadly Game), which restored the name of Griffith's character back to Abel Marsh, though he was still a lawman in a mountain town. To this end, the Mayor (Claude Rains) exhorts the people to work incessantly, even the children, to the extent that they are denied school and play. Truson protests, but his protests go unheeded by the arrogant Mayor. The following year, Stoeber released his debut album, Songs, and wrote the music for Hancock's horror film Let's Scare \n\n Hancock is a 2008 American superhero film directed by Peter Berg and starring Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman. It tells the story of a vigilante superhero, John Hancock (Smith) from Los Angeles whose alcoholism and reckless actions routinely cost the city millions of dollars. Eventually one person he saves, Ray Embrey (Bateman), makes it his mission to change Hancock's public image for the better. It languished in \"development hell\" for years with various directors attached, including Tony Scott, Michael Mann, Jonathan Mostow, and Gabriele Muccino, before being filmed in 2007 \n\n John Hancock (March 4, 1941 – October 12, 1992) was an American film and television actor.

Today he works on long-term projects using different kinds of media to showcase his artwork, such as open-air campaigns on public billboards and films. With his films, videos, photos, and also as a guest, he has contributed to many television programs in Europe. Her research examines the cognitive and neural changes that occur with normal aging, particularly in implicit (i.e., unconscious) memory, the neural mechanisms of priming, effects of attention on implicit memory, and how cognitive and neural reserve mediate the effects of normal aging on memory. In her research she uses behavioral methods, event-related potentials (ERPs), and functional neuroimaging (fMRI). One strong theme in his research is individual differences in task performance in general, and more specifically, exploring the reason why some individuals show more cognitive deficit than others in the face of brain insult.# Amnesia\n\nJ.F.Kihlstrom, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA\n\nE.L.

Balding attended Caldicott School, a boys' preparatory school, and Radley College, a public school. He became a licensed trainer in January 2003, when he succeeded his father Ian Balding. His elder sister is Clare Balding. His maternal grandfather was the trainer Peter Hastings-Bass and his maternal uncle William Hastings-Bass, 17th Earl of Huntingdon, former trainer to Queen Elizabeth II. His maternal grandmother Priscilla Hastings is descended from the Earls of Derby. His paternal grandfather was polo player Gerald Barnard Balding Sr.. Balding has been married to Anna-Lisa since 15 July 2005. They have two sons, Jonno and Toby, a daughter, Flora, and two boxer dogs, Georgia and Doris. Notable horses trained by Balding include Casual Look, the winner of the Epsom Oaks in 2003. In 2014, the Baldings' Park House Stables were visited by Irish president Michael D. Higgins as part of his state visit to the UK. He is the son-in-law of the multiple champion jockey Lester Piggott. He started his working life in his father's textile factory, but quit after three months and headed to Newmarket.

Fessler combines the voices of the women with footage from educational films and newsreels about dating, sex, “illegitimate” pregnancy and adoption. The women's stories unfold over footage of life in post-World War II America. Educational films offer guidance about dating and sex, and scripted newsreels shed light on adoption in an era when secrecy prevailed and adoptable babies were thought to be “unwanted” by their mothers. As the footage illuminates the past, the women's stories form a collective narrative as they recount their experiences of dating, pregnancy, family reaction, banishment, and the long-term impact of surrender and silence on their lives. The only thing Boryana longs for is to escape to the West. But despite her attempt to protect herself from unwanted pregnancy, her baby survives... Unwanted, Viktoria is born with no umbilical cord to connect her to her mother and thus proclaimed \"the baby of the decade\".

Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon was born at the Château de Rambouillet, the son of Louis XIV's youngest legitimised son with Madame de Montespan, the Count of \n\n Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon (16 November 1725 &ndash; 4 March 1793) was the son of Louis Alexandre de Bourbon and his wife Marie Victoire de Noailles. He was therefore a grandson of Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. He also possessed the following titles: Prince of Lamballe (given later as a courtesy title to the duke's only surviving son); Prince of Carignano; Duke of Rambouillet; Duke of Aumale (1775); Duke of Gisors; Duke of Châteauvillain; Duke of Arc-en-Barrois; Duke of Amboise; Count of Eu; Count of Guingamp. He was the father in law of Philippe Égalité. He was a son of Charles d'Albert, 1st Duke of Luynes, a favorite of Louis XIII, and Princess Marie Aimée de Rohan, Mademoiselle de Montbazon (1600–1679). After his father's death, his mother remarried to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse (a son of Henry I, Duke of Guise), with whom she had three daughters. His maternal grandparents were Hercules de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon and, his first wife, Marie de Bretagne d'Avaugour. His paternal grandparents were Anne de Rodulf and Honoré d'Albert (1540–1592), seigneur de Luynes (in today's département Bouches-du-Rhône in Provence), who was in the service of the three last Valois kings and of Henry IV of France. His paternal uncle was Honoré d'Albert, Duke of Chaulnes. ; 10) Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier (1775–1807). ; 12) Françoise d'Orléans Mademoiselle d'Orléans (1777–1782). ; 14) Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1810–1842). ; 17) Charles, Duke of Penthièvre (1820–1828). ; 21) Léopold Philippe, Duke of Guise (1847–1847). Over the years, the duc de Penthièvre also acquired other estates:  Because his male heir, the prince de Lamballe, predeceased him in 1768, his only surviving child, his daughter, became the sole heir to his fortune. He was the third and youngest son of Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, later Duke of Orléans as Philippe Égalité, and of his wife, Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon.

He was therefore a grandson of Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. He also possessed the following titles: Prince of Lamballe (given later as a courtesy title to the duke's only surviving son); Prince of Carignano; Duke of Rambouillet; Duke of Aumale (1775); Duke of Gisors; Duke of Châteauvillain; Duke of Arc-en-Barrois; Duke of Amboise; Count of Eu; Count of Guingamp. He was the father in law of Philippe Égalité. He was a son of Charles d'Albert, 1st Duke of Luynes, a favorite of Louis XIII, and Princess Marie Aimée de Rohan, Mademoiselle de Montbazon (1600–1679). After his father's death, his mother remarried to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse (a son of Henry I, Duke of Guise), with whom she had three daughters. His maternal grandparents were Hercules de Rohan, Duke of Montbazon and, his first wife, Marie de Bretagne d'Avaugour.

Over the years, the duc de Penthièvre also acquired other estates:  Because his male heir, the prince de Lamballe, predeceased him in 1768, his only surviving child, his daughter, became the sole heir to his fortune. He was the third and youngest son of Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres, later Duke of Orléans as Philippe Égalité, and of his wife, Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon.

Further, alleging that Gao Cheng had previously forced his wife Empress Li Zu'e to have sexual relations with Gao Cheng, Emperor Wenxuan forced her to have sexual relations with him. In 1615, the crown prince became infuriated with his concubine, Lady Liu, who was the mother of the future Chongzhen Emperor. He ordered her punished, during which ordeal Lady Liu died. It is debated whether the crown prince ordered her to be killed or if her death was an accident. On his ascension to the throne, the Chongzhen Emperor had Lady Liu reburied in the Ming tombs next to her husband. She was subsequently given to Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng as his wife, although the date of the marriage is not known. Princess Pingyi was said to be both beautiful and virtuous. In 541, she bore Gao Cheng a son, Gao Xiaowan (高孝琬). Emperor Xiaojing personally visited Gao Cheng and her to congratulate them. After she died in 97 at the age of 34, however, it became known that he was actually born of Consort Liang. Instead, she was buried with full imperial honors, with her husband Emperor Zhang. She was a concubine of Emperor Xuan, and she was the mother of his son and crown prince Xiao Kui. He honored Emperor Xuan's wife Empress Wang as empress dowager and honored Consort Cao as consort dowager. She was descended from Manchu family from the Silin-Gioro 西林覺羅 clan. It had been claimed that she was born into a banner family named Gu and took on Manchu identity after her marriage to Yihui 奕会 (1799-1838), a Manchu prince. Other scholars claim that the confusion about her identity is an attempt to obscure her family's descent from E-er-tai, a Manchu grand secretary disgraced (and forced to commit suicide) during one of Qianlong's literary inquisitions. Her marriage to Yihui seems to have been a happy one, despite the fact that she had the status of concubine rather than primary princess consort (Yihui's princess consort was Lady Hešeri). She visited the palace with her daughter-in-law Youlan when Puyi turned 10 years old. In 1921, Puyi and Consort Dowager Duankang had an argument. Consort Dowager Duankang was angered and reprimanded Cuiyan and Youlan, causing Cuiyan to become disabled from fear. Youlan felt angry for being publicly reprimanded and committed suicide by swallowing opium. In 1925, when Puyi arrived in Tianjin, Liugiya Cuiyan died at the age of 58.

Under the laws of the time, the only way Eanflæd could take revenge for her cousin's death was to kill her husband or accept a substantial gift known as a \n\n first abbess, King Alfred's daughter Æthelgifu, so much so perhaps that William of Malmesbury wrote contradictory reports on the abbey's early history. In the Gesta regum, he correctly identifies the first abbess as Alfred's daughter, following Asser, although he gives her the name of Ælfgifu (Elfgiva), while in his Gesta pontificum, he credits Edmund's wife Ælfgifu with the foundation. In any event, William would have had access to local traditions at Shaftesbury, since he probably wrote a now lost metrical Life for the community, a fragment of which he included in his Gesta pontificum:   \n\n Æthelburh of Kent (Ethelburga) was the daughter of the Christian King Æthelberht of Kent. She married King Edwin of Northumbria in 625, an important event in the transmission of Christianity from Kent to the north of England as his conversion was a condition of their marriage. Lyminge suffered from numerous Viking raids due to its particular vulnerability, and its people were subsequently taken refuge for protection in the city of Canterbury by 804. The exact location of the abbey is not known but is believed to be around Lyminge church, which is dedicated to St Mary and St Ethelburga. Her mother appears to have been an associate of Shaftesbury Abbey called Wynflaed (also Wynnflæd). The vital clue comes from a charter of King Edgar, in which he confirmed the grant of an estate at Uppidelen (Piddletrenthide, Dorset) made by his grandmother (ava) Wynflæd to Shaftesbury. It records that she received and retrieved from King Edmund a handful of estates in Dorset, namely Cheselbourne and Winterbourne Tomson, which somehow ended up in the possession of the community. According to the monastic history, Evesham came through the Norman Conquest unusually well, because of a quick approach by Abbot Æthelwig to William the Conqueror. In the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that she suffered from an illness during the last few years of her life, but there may have been some confusion with details of Æthelgifu's life as recorded in a forged foundation charter of the late 11th or 12th century (see below). Her body was buried and enshrined at the nunnery. To fulfil his son's desire, and to benefit his soul, Ælfgar gave to St. Rémy five pieces of land: at Lapley, Hamstall Ridware, Meaford, and Marston in Church Eaton, all in Staffordshire, and at Silvington in Shropshire. According to the Kentish Royal Legend, Minster Abbey was a double monastery founded AD 670 by Domne Eafe or Domneva; Eormenburg or Ermenburga is either her original name or that of her sister.

        "context": "It was founded at Gilling in what is currently North Yorkshire by Queen Eanflæd, the wife of King Oswiu of Northumbria, who persuaded her husband to found it at the site where Oswiu had killed a rival and kinsman, King Oswine of Deira. Under the laws of the time, the only way Eanflæd could take revenge for her cousin's death was to kill her husband or accept a substantial gift known as a \n\n first abbess, King Alfred's daughter Æthelgifu, so much so perhaps that William of Malmesbury wrote contradictory reports on the abbey's early history. In the Gesta regum, he correctly identifies the first abbess as Alfred's daughter, following Asser, although he gives her the name of Ælfgifu (Elfgiva), while in his Gesta pontificum, he credits Edmund's wife Ælfgifu with the foundation. In any event, William would have had access to local traditions at Shaftesbury, since he probably wrote a now lost metrical Life for the community, a fragment of which he included in his Gesta pontificum:   \n\n Æthelburh of Kent (Ethelburga) was the daughter of the Christian King Æthelberht of Kent. She married King Edwin of Northumbria in 625, an important event in the transmission of Christianity from Kent to the north of England as his conversion was a condition of their marriage. Lyminge suffered from numerous Viking raids due to its particular vulnerability, and its people were subsequently taken refuge for protection in the city of Canterbury by 804. The exact location of the abbey is not known but is believed to be around Lyminge church, which is dedicated to St Mary and St Ethelburga. Her mother appears to have been an associate of Shaftesbury Abbey called Wynflaed (also Wynnflæd). The vital clue comes from a charter of King Edgar, in which he confirmed the grant of an estate at Uppidelen (Piddletrenthide, Dorset) made by his grandmother (ava) Wynflæd to Shaftesbury. It records that she received and retrieved from King Edmund a handful of estates in Dorset, namely Cheselbourne and Winterbourne Tomson, which somehow ended up in the possession of the community. According to the monastic history, Evesham came through the Norman Conquest unusually well, because of a quick approach by Abbot Æthelwig to William the Conqueror. In the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that she suffered from an illness during the last few years of her life, but there may have been some confusion with details of Æthelgifu's life as recorded in a forged foundation charter of the late 11th or 12th century (see below). Her body was buried and enshrined at the nunnery. To fulfil his son's desire, and to benefit his soul, Ælfgar gave to St. Rémy five pieces of land: at Lapley, Hamstall Ridware, Meaford, and Marston in Church Eaton, all in Staffordshire, and at Silvington in Shropshire. According to the Kentish Royal Legend, Minster Abbey was a double monastery founded AD 670 by Domne Eafe or Domneva; Eormenburg or Ermenburga is either her original name or that of her sister.

Film critic Harry M. Benshoff has claimed the film to be an allegory of the AIDS epidemic of the late 1980s. The Kissing Booth was released on Netflix on May 11, 2018, and was dubbed a commercial success by the service, due to it being widely viewed by subscribers, leading to the eventual production of a trilogy of films. The film was largely panned by critics, who deemed its storyline and themes to be clichéd. A sequel, The Kissing Booth 2, was released on July 24, 2020, and the third film, The Kissing Booth 3, was released on August 11, 2021. It stars Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Dekker, Cassandra Peterson, Noah Segan, and Jack Donner. Felice is sent away on a train with her aunt, who possesses a cursed totem talisman resembling a serpent. En route to Europe, her aunt, compelled by the talisman, attacks Felice, violently kissing her as blood spills from her mouth. The train's conductor finds her aunt's deformed corpse, and Felice departs the train with the talisman. Based on the 1995 novel The Invisible Circus by Jennifer Egan, the film is about a teenage girl who travels to Europe in 1976 in search of answers to her older sister's suicide. The film ran in a tour of United States cinemas July-November 2010. The film had a limited release on June 17, 2010 as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival (Shock). The film was released in the United States on May 5, 1995, and received mixed reviews. In June 1998, production on a sequel titled The Hunchback of Notre Dame Deux: The Secret of the Bells was announced, and slated for release in fall 1999. However, the sequel was delayed from its planned fall release in order to accommodate the recording of \"I'm Gonna Love You\" by Jennifer Love Hewitt. In 2002, the direct-to-video sequel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame II, was released on VHS and DVD. He also meets and falls in love with a new girl named Madellaine who has come to Paris with her evil circus master, Sarousch. Disney thought that it was appropriate to make the sequel more fun and child-friendly due to the dark and grim themes of the original film.

        "context": "The plot follows two young women who find themselves haunted by an ancient parasitic curse that was passed on to one of them by a kiss. Film critic Harry M. Benshoff has claimed the film to be an allegory of the AIDS epidemic of the late 1980s. The Kissing Booth was released on Netflix on May 11, 2018, and was dubbed a commercial success by the service, due to it being widely viewed by subscribers, leading to the eventual production of a trilogy of films. The film was largely panned by critics, who deemed its storyline and themes to be clichéd. A sequel, The Kissing Booth 2, was released on July 24, 2020, and the third film, The Kissing Booth 3, was released on August 11, 2021. It stars Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Dekker, Cassandra Peterson, Noah Segan, and Jack Donner. Felice is sent away on a train with her aunt, who possesses a cursed totem talisman resembling a serpent. En route to Europe, her aunt, compelled by the talisman, attacks Felice, violently kissing her as blood spills from her mouth. The train's conductor finds her aunt's deformed corpse, and Felice departs the train with the talisman. Based on the 1995 novel The Invisible Circus by Jennifer Egan, the film is about a teenage girl who travels to Europe in 1976 in search of answers to her older sister's suicide. The film ran in a tour of United States cinemas July-November 2010. The film had a limited release on June 17, 2010 as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival (Shock). The film was released in the United States on May 5, 1995, and received mixed reviews. In June 1998, production on a sequel titled The Hunchback of Notre Dame Deux: The Secret of the Bells was announced, and slated for release in fall 1999. However, the sequel was delayed from its planned fall release in order to accommodate the recording of \"I'm Gonna Love You\" by Jennifer Love Hewitt. In 2002, the direct-to-video sequel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame II, was released on VHS and DVD. He also meets and falls in love with a new girl named Madellaine who has come to Paris with her evil circus master, Sarousch. Disney thought that it was appropriate to make the sequel more fun and child-friendly due to the dark and grim themes of the original film. The film and series stars Kippei Shiina, Kyoko Hinami and Shinnosuke Mitsushima.\n\n"

Born in Baden-Baden, he was the oldest son of William, Margrave of Baden-Baden and Catharina Ursula of Hohenzollern–Hechingen. Ferdinand Maximilian of Baden was destined to follow in his father's footsteps as Margrave of Baden-Baden, but he died before his father in a hunting accident. Ferdinand Maximilian married in Paris in 1653 Princess Louise of Savoy (1627–1689), aunt of Prince Eugene of Savoy. Louise Christine of Savoy refused to leave the refined French court and follow her husband to Baden-Baden. Ferdinand Maximilian then abducted his son from Paris and brought him to Baden-Baden. As a consequence Louis William was not raised by his mother, but by his grandfather's second wife Maria Magdalena of Oettingen-Baldern. His maternal grandparents were Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou. Charles was born in Düsseldorf, the oldest of five children of Frederick Michael, Count Palatine of Birkenfeld and Countess Palatine Maria Franziska of Sulzbach. He inherited the duchy of Zweibrücken from his paternal uncle, Duke Christian IV, in 1775. He was heir presumptive to his childless cousin Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria whom, however, he predeceased. His mother was Maria Elisabeth (née Baroness Orlick von Laziska). He married Philippine Gabriele, a daughter of the president of the Imperial Chamber Court, Philipp Karl von Groschlag, and former lover of the future emperor, Joseph II when living in Frankfurt am Main, before moving to Vienna. 1) John William Friso, Prince of Orange (1687–1711) m.

Mel Gibson stars as \"Mad\" Max Rockatansky, a police officer-turned-vigilante in a near-future Australia in the midst of societal collapse. Filmed on a budget of A$400,000, it earned more than US$100 million worldwide in gross revenue and held the  Guinness record for most profitable film. The success of Mad Max has been credited for further opening up the global market to Australian New Wave films. The film became the first in the Mad Max series, giving rise to three sequels: Mad Max 2 (1981), Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and Fury Road (2015). In 2020 a fifth film, to be titled Furiosa, was announced. Ab Tak Chhappan 2 opens to encounter specialist Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) proclaiming what he did was right.\n\n"

Written and produced by Cyrus and Oren Yoel, \"Inspired\" is a country ballad about creating a difference in the world. Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign inspired Cyrus to write the track, which references her father Billy Ray and her childhood in Tennessee. Cyrus donated her personal profits from the song to her Happy Hippie Foundation, which deals with homelessness among LGBTQ youth. Media outlets wrote that Cyrus adopted a flower child persona for the song. In an interview on The Zach Sang Show, Cyrus said \"Inspired\" was a \"new, older version\" of her 2009 single \"The Climb\". \"Inspired\" begins with the lyrics \"I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see, starting with the bees, or else they're gonna die\", which Bustle's Dana Getz interpreted as a commentary on climate change. The song transitions into Cyrus' memories of her father Billy Ray Cyrus and her childhood in Tennessee. The song was written by Fefe Dobson, Anne Preven and produced by Annetenna. The song was originally recorded by Fefe Dobson, who passed the song to Cyrus, as she did not desire to include it on Sunday Love. Cyrus performed the song in 2007 and 2008 the Best of Both Worlds Tour, as the opening number for her performances as herself.

Also, the depiction of Robbie Ray as a has-been country star is meant to poke fun at Cyrus's own music career, which by some was labeled a one hit wonder before the popularity of Hannah Montana. Robby and other characters on Hannah Montana occasionally reference Cyrus's real-life music and television careers. Since Billy Ray Cyrus impersonated himself with his character, this hints that Cyrus and his daughter Miley may exist in the show's universe. Gil Kaufman of Billboard described the track's genre as \"longing\" dark pop. \"I Don't Miss You at All\" mentions F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author of the 1925 classic novel The Great Gatsby. Robby Ray Stewart (Billy Ray Cyrus) is the widower father of Jackson and Miley Stewart. He is also Hannah Montana's manager, who was a former country singer. As Miley's father, he is also referred to as Hannah's father whenever they appear together publicly.

One of his colleagues, who he is also his best friend, is Nimisha (Jyothika). His mother finally succeeds in finding a traditional girl in Abhirami (Geethu Mohandas); \n\n The show is about a woman who is struggling and moves ahead in her life though she faces various problems in her life. The female lead was ‘Amrita’ who was a professional lawyer. He incites his friend Sagar into kidnapping her, who mistakenly abducts Amrita. Spurned by society and even by her family members for having spent a night out of her hostel, Amirita unwittingly becomes a victim of fate, and so begins a tale of misery and woe. Her indefatigable courage enables her to fight with criminals, including Vikas. The story progresses with different characters whom she meets in her life and struggles hard within the society and against the criminals she was dealing within her cases. Meanwhile, Srimathy (Reema Sen), Ganesh's professor's daughter, wants to meet Ganesh and thank him for helping her escape from the clutches of some vile elements. Eswari (Sriya Reddy) is a shrewish, arrogant 'kattapanchayata' woman. Srimathy's family falls afoul \n\n Molly is an unstoppable woman, who will do only what she feels is right.

Beginners premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, where the Los Angeles Times heralded it as a \"heady, heartfelt film\" with a cast who have \"a strong sense of responsibility to their real-world counterparts\". The film is structured as a series of interconnected flashbacks. Shortly after Hal's death, Oliver meets Anna, a French actress, at a party. , the film holds an 85% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 161 reviews with an average rating of 7.46/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Wearing its twee heart on its sleeve, Beginners explores the depths of modern, multi-generational romance with wit and depth.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film holds an average score of 81 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Diego Costa from Slant Magazine wrote, \"One of the most distinct pleasures of Beginners \n\n the way it puts together fragments of someone's life — presumably the filmmaker's, although little does it matter — with humility, and without vying for some complete whole.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"The movie darts, dreams, and sometimes seems to dance.

But two months into his short life his parents noticed his health was declining. He was diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and loss of motor skills. Charlie was the 16th person to ever be diagnosed with the disease, according to his parents. As the disease progressed, Charlie became weaker, losing the ability to move his arms or legs or breathe, and he experienced seizures. He was then placed on a ventilator that was breathing for him. Through their own research, Charlie’s parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, found a doctor in the United States doing research on an experimental treatment called nucleoside bypass therapy who was willing to treat Charlie. The doctor, Michio Hirano of New York’s Columbia University Medical Center, specializes in myopathies and other neuromuscular diseases.

The footage was originally meant to show the healthcare professionals what was happening in Evan's life and to help them access the treatment Evan needed. Evan Perry had a family medical history involving serious mental illnesses. This documentary mostly focused on how his bipolar depression affected him and those who loved him. About four years after Evan's death, the documentary was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and released on television and DVD. It shocked her because at that age, she thought kids would not even know what death is, and he did not seem sad when he was talking about dying. The teacher told his parents, and Hart and Dana Perry took him to see a therapist. Dana Perry, a professional filmmaker, knew that psychiatrists would not believe everything she told them about her son. At this point, she decided to film as much as she could from Evan's life, especially when he talked about suicide. Evan was very much into filming, just like his parents. His responses were really short towards his family, he was listening to Nirvana, he was writing songs about suicide, demons, and pain, and he would lock himself in his room away from everyone. Middle childhood When Evan was 10 years old he started attending Pk Yonge School and made his first attempt to commit suicide.\n\n"

She worked on several films with director Sidney Lumet, including Network, Prince of the City, The Verdict, Garbo Talks, Family Business, and Q&A. She also worked on several films starring Sylvester Stallone, including Rocky II, Rocky III, Cobra, Rambo III, Lock Up, and Demolition Man. In addition, Todd was casting director for Paul Mazursky's Moscow on the Hudson (in which she also appeared) and Scenes from a Mall as well as the 1994 American Civil War drama Gettysburg and its 2003 prequel, Gods and Generals. She also did casting work on Ghostbusters, was one of the casting directors on Sergio Leone's acclaimed Once Upon a Time in America and helped cast extras in such films as Kramer vs. Kramer, Sea of Love and Hudson Hawk. The film has yet to go into production and Morricone was cagey as to details on account of Tornatore's superstitious nature. The film re-unites Bartel with his Eating Raoul co-stars Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran. It also stars Jacqueline Bisset, Ray Sharkey, Ed Begley Jr., Wallace Shawn, Paul Mazursky, and Rebecca Schaeffer.\n\n"
