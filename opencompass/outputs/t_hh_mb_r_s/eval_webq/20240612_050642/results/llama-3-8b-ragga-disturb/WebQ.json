Recently, Jamaican patois has gone through a process of decreolization, similar to that which happened with AAVE due to the basilect creole variety developing \n\n the native languages of the many ethnic and cultural groups within the Caribbean including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian and English along with several African languages. Jamaican Patois is also spoken in Costa Rica and French Creole is spoken in Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana in South America. Often these patois are popularly considered \"broken English\" or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified with more correctness as a Creole language; in fact, in the Francophone Caribbean the analogous term for local basilectal languages is créole (see also Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole). It is important to note that for all practical purposes, English is Jamaica's native language. When the English took over the country from the Spanish in the seventeenth century Jamaica was linguistically a blank slate. Today we know this creole as patois, and even those Jamaicans who don't speak it on a daily basis can speak it fluently, and fully understand it. Standard English is taught in Jamaican schools, although teachers may speak to pupils and their parents in patois outside of the classroom. Jamaican Patois, known locally as Patwa, is an English–African creole language spoken primarily in Jamaica and the Jamaican diaspora. Jamaicans themselves usually refer to their use of English as patwa, a term without a precise linguistic definition. Jamaican Patois contains many loanwords of African origin, a majority of those etymologically from Gold Coast region (particularly of the Asante-Twi dialect of the Akan language of Ghana).\n\nQuestion: what does jamaican people speak?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was also the governor of Tennessee from 1839 to 1841. He was a devout follower of Jacksonian democratic values. Polk was also elected to the Kent County Levy Court in 1819. In 1826, the Federalist Party selected Polk as their candidate for governor, and after a hard-fought campaign, he was elected, narrowly defeating the Democratic-Republican candidate, David Hazzard. Satisfied by these developments, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency. Polk's narrow victory over Clay in the November election was seen by the Tyler administration as a mandate for completing the resolution. James Knox Polk (November 2, 1795 – June 15, 1849) was the 11th president of the United States (1845–1849). Polk was born in North Carolina. He later lived in and became Governor of the state of Tennessee. A Democrat, and an ardent supporter of Andrew Jackson, Polk served as Speaker of the House (1835–1839) and Governor of Tennessee (1839–1841) before becoming president. During his single four-year term, Polk accomplished every major goal that he set for his administration and successfully managed the Mexican–American War, obtaining for the United States most of its present contiguous land area.\n\nQuestion: what did james k polk do before he was president?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The concerto is in three movements:  Simon Keefe has noted contemporary comments from Mozart's era on how the woodwind writing in this concerto showed a \"newly intricate and sophisticated\" character compared to Mozart's prior keyboard concerti. M. S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the coda of the finale, starting at measure 315, from 2/4 to 3/8, and subsequent thematic transformations. 453, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was written in 1784. As is typical with concerti, it is in three movements:  According to the date that the composer himself noted on the score, the concerto was completed on April 12, 1784. In one view, the work is said to have been premiered by Mozart's student Barbara Ployer on June 13, 1784, at a concert to which Mozart had invited Giovanni \n\n Mozart composed the concerto for performance at a series of concerts at the Vienna venues of the Trattnerhof and the Burgtheater in the first quarter of 1784, where he was himself the soloist in March 1784. In a letter to his father, Mozart compared this concerto with the 16th concerto in D: \"'I consider them both to be concertos which make one sweat; but the B flat one beats the one in D for difficulty.'\" Many pianists consider this to be one of the most difficult of Mozart's piano concertos. Beginning with this concerto, Mozart began to use the term \"grand\" to describe his concerto such as K.450 which feature a prominent and required wind section for the ensemble. From this notebook we have the information that he completed the concerto on February 9, 1784. This concerto has three movements: 1. Works written in 1784 include, besides this concerto, the five piano concertos 15–19, the Quintet in E for Piano and Winds, and several piano works – the Sonata in C minor being the most noteworthy—one string quartet (the \"Hunt\"), and several sets of orchestral dances. Works by other composers who were known to Mozart from around this time include the 80th symphony (in D minor) and second cello concerto of Joseph Haydn.\n\nQuestion: who did mozart write his four horn concertos for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While a professor at Tuskegee Institute, Carver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. He wanted poor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. Apart from his work to improve the lives of farmers, Carver was also a leader in promoting environmentalism. George Washington Earle was born in Truxton, New York in 1849. In 1851, his family moved to Huntley, Illinois, and when he was only ten years old Gerge left home on his own. Earle attended school, and eventually acquired enough education that he became a schoolteacher. However, he was unsatisfied, and in 1868 returned to New York and began doing piecework in a sash and door factory, continuing until he had saved enough money to attend medical college. In 1872, Earle gradualted from Buffalo Medical College, receiving his diploma from Millard Fillmore. Carver had an initial enrollment of around 600, which remained fairly constant until the school closed. In 1969, Carroll County completed its local integration process; Carver was closed and all students were reassigned to previously all-white high schools. Much of the credit for these pioneering efforts can be attributed directly to Booker T. Washington, founder of the institute, and to world-renowned agricultural researcher George Washington Carver.\n\nQuestion: where was george washington carver from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Among the leading intellectuals of his time, Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter and signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first United States postmaster general. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity.

In 1872, the Italian physicist and engineer Enrico Bernardi combined three Franklin tubes to build a simple heat motor that was powered by evaporation in a way similar to the drinking bird.

Who was one of the first individuals to suggest using contact lenses to improve vision? **T** he great Italian artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) first came up with the idea for contact lenses in 1508. ### Who invented bifocal lenses? The original bifocal lens was invented in 1784 by Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790).In 1909 J. L. Borsch welded the two lenses together.One-part bifocal lenses were developed in 1910 by researches at the Carl Zeiss Company.### What part of the eye was the first to be successfully transplanted?The cornea was the first tissue from the eye that was successfully transplanted. Benjamin Franklin was sufficiently impressed by a verrillon performance on a visit to London in 1757 that he created his own instrument, the glass armonica, in 1762. Franklin's armonica inspired several other instruments, including two created by Chladni. Franklin was a prodigious inventor. Among his many creations were the lightning rod, Franklin stove, bifocal glasses and the flexible urinary catheter.

At the outbreak of the war, the German Army, with seven field armies in the west and one in the east, executed a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan, bypassing French defenses along the common border by moving quickly through neutral Belgium, and then turning southwards to attack France and attempt to encircle the French Army and trap it on the German border. On 2 August 1914, following the events leading to the outbreak of World War I, the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country. From as early as 1904, Alfred von Schlieffen of the German General Staff began to draw up a military strategy, known as the Schlieffen Plan, which could be put into action if Germany found itself involved in a two-front war against France and Russia. The core of the plan was a rapid attack on France on the outbreak of war, forcing a quick victory in the west before the Russians had time to fully mobilize their forces. The Schlieffen Plan took advantage of the French military's concentration and fortifications along the Franco-German border by prescribing an invasion of neutral Belgium and Luxembourg. On 4 August 1914, the German army invaded Belgium just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of Liège, Namur and Antwerp and pushing the 200,000-strong Belgian army, supported by their French and British allies, to the far west.\n\nQuestion: what country did germany invade first in ww1?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

DeWine won the election. In the Attorney General race, Democratic incumbent Richard Cordray was defeated by Republican Mike DeWine, a former two-term United States Senator from Ohio and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee as well as a former county prosecutor. DeWine would go on to defeat Cordray once again in the 2018 race for governor with running mate Jon Husted, the former Secretary of State. Incumbent Republican Governor John Kasich won reelection to a second term in office by a landslide over Democratic candidate Ed FitzGerald and Green Party candidate Anita Rios. Primary elections were held on May 6, 2014. Despite FitzGerald's massive defeat, he is as of 2018 the last Democrat to carry the historically Democratic Monroe County, which voted for Republican candidate Mike DeWine four years later.

In November 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. Johnson was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One within a few hours of Kennedy's assassination. Succeeding to the presidency just about a year before the 1964 presidential election, Johnson launched War on poverty and signed Clean Air Act as his initial legislation. When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961.\" He also escalated the Vietnam War, which significantly reduced his popularity. Initially, Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate, but soon after, Senator Robert F. Kennedy too challenged him. While campaigning, Kennedy was assassinated shortly after midnight at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.

King was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, the day after giving his final speech \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\". Claims soon arose over suspect aspects of King's assassination and the controversial role of the alleged assassin, James Earl Ray. On April 4, 1968, the day of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy delivered an impromptu speech on race reconciliation to a mostly African-American crowd in a poor inner-city Indianapolis neighborhood. It was to these striking workers that King delivered his final speech, and in Memphis that he was killed. In Oakland, increasing friction between Black Panthers and the police led to the death of Bobby Hutton. The King assassination riots, also known as the Holy Week Uprising, were a wave of civil disturbance which swept the United States following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968. Some of the biggest riots took place in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Kansas City.\n\nQuestion: what town was martin luther king assassinated in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On 3 October 1849 he was found delirious in Baltimore, Maryland, \"in great distress, and ... in need of immediate assistance\", according to the man who \n\nBoth Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe faced various illnesses and struggles throughout their lives. Baudelaire, like Poe, had a traumatic childhood. On the other hand, Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, suffered from tuberculosis, which caused her to cough up blood while singing at the piano when she was only twenty years old. Poe himself struggled with depression and alcoholism, and his health deteriorated over time. Overall, both Baudelaire and Poe faced personal and health-related challenges, which ultimately influenced their creative lives and the works they produced. Both Baudelaire and Poe suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, contracted tuberculosis, coughing blood while singing at the piano at the age of twenty. She died from the disease five years later and Poe's depression and alcoholism killed him two years after that. As in the death of Austen, there are a number of (conspiracy) theories as to the cause of Poe's death, including alcoholism, rabies, heart disease, cholera, drug-abuse, stroke, epilepsy, suicide, accidental suicide, delirium tremens, syphilis, tubercular meningitis and/or tuberculosis. Whatever it was that killed him, Poe was found delirious on 3 October, 1849 in the streets of Baltimore, wearing someone else's clothes. Both were also drug addicts and alcoholics, both suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and both died in sad circumstances, poor and alone in hospital rooms.Both Poe and Baudelaire were, arguably, the pioneers of modernist aesthetics.He spent the last years of his life in a semi-catatonic state in nursing homes and eventually died on 31 August, 1867.Both Baudelaire and Poe suffered from various illnesses throughout their lives and Poe's wife, Virginia Clemm, contracted tuberculosis, coughing blood while singing at the piano at the age of twenty.

This process was first developed by Charles Goodyear in the mid-19th century and revolutionized the use of rubber in various applications, including denture base materials. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1922 from Ohio State University after starting work at Goodyear in 1919. In 1920 Sebrell isolated mercaptobenzothiazole, an important rubber vulcanization accelerator from various reactions. Although well known since the 1880s, Sebrell's insight was that it is generated in situ during the zinc-catalyzed vulcanization of rubber. He devised ways of producing mercaptothiazole on a commercial scale. In the fall of 1928 Bock had the idea to copolymerize dimethyl butadiene with isoprene and butadiene, respectively, to combine the positive mechanical properties. Both synthetic rubbers had mechanical properties almost comparable with natural rubber. In spring 1929 Bock replaced dimethyl butadiene by styrene. The first US patent (number 61,991) on dextrin (a starch derivative) adhesive was issued in 1867. Natural rubber was first used as material for adhesives starting in 1830, which marked the starting point of the modern adhesive. The development of the automobile and the need for rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable bonds of \n\n Lorin Beryl Sebrell (19 November 1894 – 5 August 1984) was an American scientist at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. noted for identifying mercaptobenzothiazole as a vulcanization accelerator.\n\nQuestion: when did charles goodyear invented rubber?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While French resistance continued with the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle, the surrender of Metropolitan France ended any further attempts by the British to unite the two countries. The first phase saw the capitulation of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. After capitulation, France was governed as Vichy France headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain. From 1940 to 1942, while the Vichy regime was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine, the Germans and Italians militarily occupied northern and south-eastern France. It was not until 1944 when France was liberated with the allied invasion restoring the French Government. ; 15 June — World War II: Verdun falls to German forces. ; 17 June — A Luftwaffe Junkers 88 bomber sinks the British ship RMS Lancastria, which was evacuating troops from near Saint-Nazaire, France, killing some 5,800 men. ; 21 June — World War II: Vichy France and Germany sign an armistice at Compiegne, in the same wagon-lit railroad car used by Marshal Ferdinand Foch to accept the surrender of Germany in 1918. ; 23 June — World War II: German leader Adolf Hitler surveys newly defeated Paris in now occupied France. German forces split the French from their British allies by striking through the lightly-defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks. The invaders forced the British Expeditionary Force to evacuate, and defeated several French divisions before they advanced to Paris, and down the strategic Atlantic coast. By June, the dire French military situation had French politics revolving around whether the Third Republic should negotiate an armistice, fight on from North Africa, or just surrender. President Albert Lebrun \n\n After the stunningly quick defeat in June 1940, France was knocked out of the war; part of it, with its capital in Vichy, became an informal ally of the Germans. A powerful Resistance movement sprang up, as the Germans fortified the coast against an Allied invasion and occupied the northern half of the country. The Germans captured 2,000,000 French soldiers, and kept them as prisoners of war in camps inside of Germany for the duration of the war, using them as hostages to guarantee French cooperation. Nevertheless, there was a strong Resistance movement, with fierce anti-resistance activities carried out by the Nazis and the French police.\n\nQuestion: who did france surrender to in ww2?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The religion of Islam founded by Muhammad in 7th century Arabia incorporated ideas from Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Christianity, specifically monotheism, Last Judgment, Heaven and Hell. However, it is closer to Judaism than Christianity, since it believes in the Unity of God, and God is seen as powerful rather than loving. The doctrine of Islam is based on five pillars: Shahada, faith; Salat, prayer; Zakat, alms-giving; Sawm, fasting; and Hajj, pilgrimage. Starting from soon after its foundation, Islam has broken into several strands, including: \n\n The first pillar of Islam is the Shahada, the assertion of faith. The first shahada promotes the essential unity of the faith, proclaiming that there is no god but God.

Frederick has long since been an important crossroads, located at the intersection of a major north–south Native American trail and east–west routes to the Chesapeake Bay, both at Baltimore and what became Washington, D.C. and across the Appalachian mountains to the Ohio River watershed. Frederick is home to Frederick Municipal Airport (IATA: FDK), which accommodates general aviation, and Fort Detrick, a U.S. Army bioscience/communications research installation and Frederick county's largest employer. Offices are located in Winchester Hall in the county seat, Frederick. As the county seat for Western Maryland, Frederick not only was an important market town but also the seat of justice. Although Montgomery County and Washington County were split off from Frederick County in 1776, Frederick remained the seat of the smaller (though still large) county. Important lawyers who practiced in Frederick included John Hanson, Francis Scott Key and Roger B. Taney.

Atticus Finch's willingness to support social outcasts and victims of prejudice is the eponymous inspiration for the name of the Atticus Circle, which is an organization composed of \"straight allies\" (that is, heterosexual people supportive of the LGBT rights movement). In 2016, the lawyer Joseph Madison Beck published the memoir My Father & Atticus Finch, in which he noted the numerous parallels between his father Foster Beck's defense of a black man accused of raping a white woman in the 1938 trial State of Alabama vs. Charles White, Alias, and Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird. In a letter to the author, Harper Lee herself noted the \"obvious parallels\" between the cases (Lee was 12 at the time of the Charles White trial) and between Atticus Finch and Foster Beck, though she also stated that she could not recall the trial, and that To Kill a Mockingbird was a work of fiction. Former President Barack Obama referenced Atticus Finch as an ideal American character, and mentioned him during his farewell address to the nation on January 11, 2017. Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, Harper had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20. In 1858, Harper refused to give up her seat or ride in the \"colored\" section of a segregated trolley car in Philadelphia (97 years before Rosa Parks). Atticus is a lawyer and resident of the fictional Maycomb County, Alabama, and the father of Jeremy \"Jem\" Finch and Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch. He represents the African-American man Tom Robinson in his trial where he is charged with rape of Mayella Ewell. Lee based the character on her own father, Amasa Coleman Lee, an Alabama lawyer, who, like Atticus, represented black defendants in a highly publicized criminal trial.\n\nQuestion: what highschool did harper lee go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Stalin's methods in achieving his goals, which included party purges, political repression of the general population, and forced collectivization, led to \n\nThe deaths of Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin within two decades after the Yalta Conference had significant historical and political ramifications. It may have exacerbated post-WWII miscommunication between America and the Soviet Union, which may have contributed to the onset of the Cold War. Premier Stalin's death, eight years after the conference, also had significant political implications. As the leader of the Soviet Union, his passing marked a transition in power and potential shifts in Soviet foreign policy. This had implications not only for the Soviet Union but also for international relations and the balance of power during the post-war era. According to Richard Pipes, the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for World War II. Pipes argues that both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a \"genius\". According to Pipes, Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to assert Soviet power internationally. Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitler's rule began in 1933.\n\nQuestion: who was the leader of soviet union during wwii?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle, distinct from the proton. The discovery of fission led to the creation of both nuclear power and nuclear weapons by the end of World War II. The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles: Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon\n\nQuestion: what did the scientist chadwick discovered?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to the 2018 national census roughly 0.8% of the total citizens of Indonesia were Buddhists, and numbered around more than 2 million. Most Buddhists are concentrated in Jakarta, Riau, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung, North Sumatra, and West Kalimantan. These totals, however, are probably inflated, as practitioners of Taoism and Chinese folk religion, which are not considered official religions of Indonesia, likely declared themselves as Buddhists on the most recent census.

Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. Lincoln and Johnson ran together under the banner of the National Union Party, which brought together Republicans (with the exception of some hard-line abolitionist Radical Republicans who backed John C. Frémont, who eventually dropped out of the race after brokering a deal with Lincoln) and the War Democrats (the minority of Democrats who backed Lincoln's prosecution of the war, as opposed to the Peace Democrats, or Copperheads, who favored a negotiated settlement with the Confederates). This article documents the political career of Abraham Lincoln from the end of his term in the United States House of Representatives in March 1849 to the beginning of his first term as President of the United States in March 1861. After serving a single term in the House of Representatives, Lincoln returned to Springfield, Illinois, where he worked as lawyer. In 1858, he launched a challenge to Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Though Lincoln failed to unseat Douglas, he earned national notoriety for his role in the Lincoln–Douglas debates. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy. To sound a theme of unity in 1864, Lincoln ran under the banner of the National Union Party, rather than that of the Republicans. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals.\n\nQuestion: who was vp for lincoln?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today. Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a blacking factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. He sporadically produced eleven more articles between 1863–65 and an expanded edition of the work was printed in 1866. Once more he returned to the persona with some more sketches written 1868–69 and a complete set of these articles was published posthumously in 1875. The work is not markedly different from articles he contributed to Household Words, an earlier journal, or the contents of Sketches by Boz written near the start of his literary career. In November 2005, Barnes & Noble issued reprints of the Nonesuch editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including Bleak House, Great Expectations and Hard Times, the Christmas Books, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby.

After the October Revolution of 1917, Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia, and, in establishing soviet democracy, the Bolshevik régime suppressed socialists who opposed the revolution, such as the Mensheviks and factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. In November 1917, Lenin issued the Decree on Workers' Control, which called on the workers of each enterprise to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. The Bolsheviks established the first socialist state based on the ideas of soviet democracy and Leninism. With Lenin's death in 1924, there was an internal struggle in the Soviet Communist movement, mainly between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky in the form of the Right Opposition and Left Opposition respectively. Following the establishment of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin was left incapacitated by a stroke and a Troika made up of Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin and Grigory Zinoviev assumed control of the state. When Lenin died of his ailments, a power struggle broke out between the Communist Party's various factions: the right-wing led by Nikolai Bukharin, the centre led by the Troika and the left-wing led by Leon Trotsky.

Gen. Stonewall Jackson to pneumonia following a friendly fire accident. His death was a blow to the morale of the Confederate army, as he was one of its most popular and successful commanders. Many historians argue that Jackson might have succeeded in seizing key battlefield positions (such as Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill at the end of day one) that his replacements were unable or unwilling to take. It was the culmination of the Northern Virginia Campaign waged by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia against Union Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, and a battle of much larger scale and numbers than the First Battle of Bull Run (or First Manassas) fought on July 21, 1861 on the same ground. \"Stonewall\" Jackson captured the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction, threatening Pope's line of communications with Washington, D.C.

He led troops during the Creek War of 1813–1814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

Throughout his life, da Vinci sought to understand the human body in intricate detail, going beyond the surface to explore its inner workings. Furthermore, da Vinci's exploration of anatomy influenced his artistic style and brought a new level of realism to his works. Through his exploration of anatomy, da Vinci exemplified the Renaissance ideal of integrating knowledge from various fields, ultimately influencing the legacy he left as both an artist and scientist. They serve as a testament to da Vinci's genius, and his holistic approach to understanding the beauty and complexity of the human form. Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa has become one of the most recognizable paintings in the world since it was created in 1503. In response to the US tour of the Mona Lisa, Warhol created his own multicolored depiction, Colored Mona Lisa. It is an early example of his prowess of inextricably linking high art and consumer culture. These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giorgio Vasari. Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances. In his De Pictura (\"About Painting\") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which \n\n  The conservation-restoration of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper is an ongoing project that has spanned many centuries.

The Last Supper was commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan in 1495, as part of a series of renovations to the convent with the intention that the location would become the Sforza family mausoleum. When he received the commission for The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci had never worked on a piece of this great a size, fifteen feet high by almost twenty-nine feet wide.

She was the first Argentine to undergo chemotherapy – a novel treatment at that time. She became emaciated, weighing only 36 kg by June 1952. In 1952, shortly before her death from cancer at 33, Eva Perón was given the title of \"Spiritual Leader of the Nation\" by the Argentine Congress. Eva Perón has become a part of international popular culture, most famously as the subject of the musical Evita (1976).

As soon as his son was born, he decided to leave the palace to practise asceticism. Buddhism in Nepal started spreading since the reign of Ashoka through Indian and Tibetan missionaries. It has not been possible to assign with certainty the year in which Prince Siddhartha, the birth name of the Buddha, was born, it is usually placed at around 563 BCE. Buddha's Birthday (also known as Buddha Jayanti, also known as his day of enlightenment - Buddha Purnima, Buddha Pournami) is a Buddhist festival that is celebrated in most of East Asia and South Asia commemorating the birth of the Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Gautama Buddha, who was the founder of Buddhism. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563–483 BCE in Lumbini. The exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. In South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of Vesak, a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment (on the day of the full moon) and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays.

In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam.

However, the standard Chinese writing system uses a non-alphabetic script with an alphabet for supplementary use. There is no original alphabet native to China. However, there were attempts to replace the whole Chinese script with alphabets but failed in the end, so the Chinese characters were kept. including seal script, cursive script and clerical script. There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The traditional system, used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Chinese speaking communities (except Singapore and Malaysia) outside mainland China, takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The Simplified Chinese character system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass literacy, simplifies most complex traditional glyphs to fewer strokes, many to common cursive shorthand variants. These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese. If it is deemed to be a written language, writing in China will predate Mesopotamian cuneiform, long acknowledged as the first appearance of writing, by some 2,000 years; however it is more likely that the inscriptions are rather a form of proto-writing, similar to the contemporary European Vinca script. It is not limited to any specific writing system and can occur in different populations regardless of the language they speak or write. In the case of dyslexia and logographic Chinese characters, individuals with dyslexia may have difficulty converting these characters into their meanings. Additionally, the relationship between phonological capacity (the ability to process and manipulate speech sounds) and reading appears to be influenced by orthography - the way a language's writing system represents its sounds.

On January 25, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported this view, calling Lenin's support of the right of secession for the Soviet Republics a \"delay-action bomb\". The collapse of the Soviet Union caught many people by surprise. Before 1991, many thought that the collapse of the Soviet Union was impossible. The history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991, spans the period from Leonid Brezhnev's death and funeral until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Due to the years of Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development, economic growth stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the United States against the Soviet Union's forces in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Baltic republics and Eastern Europe. Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, created an atmosphere of open criticism of the Soviet government. The dramatic drop of the price \n\n oil in 1985 and 1986 profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership. Several Soviet Socialist Republics began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government.\n\nQuestion: what made the soviet union fall?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Darwin pondered why humans and animals were often generous to their \n\n the Origin of Species. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. ; Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. One hundred years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor. His work also had a significant impact on ecology.

Johnson, a Democrat and former vice president under John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as president upon Kennedy's assassination. In 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right.

In September 1776, Jefferson was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he worked to revise Virginia's laws to bring them in line with his own republican beliefs.

After revising The Origin of Species as the definitive 6th edition, his major works on species culminated in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species. In this shortened abstract of his intended \"big book\" on Natural Selection, Darwin details his theory that organisms gradually evolve through a process of natural selection, and this process leads to the formation of new species. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired \"a burning zeal\" to research natural history.

Anton Philips van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was a Dutch biologist known as the \"Father of Microbiology.\" Van Leeuwenhoek discovered and described various microorganisms, such as bacteria, protists, and sperm cells, providing valuable insights into the microscopic world. Hooke's book \"Micrographia\" published in 1665 showcased his observations and discoveries, including the first recorded observation of biological cells, which he named \"cells\" due to their resemblance to living quarters of monks. By utilizing the microscope, he identified cellular changes associated with cancer, revolutionizing the field of cytopathology. These scientists played critical roles in improving microscope design, expanding our understanding of microscopic structures, and pioneering various research techniques. Their contributions have paved the way for countless advancements in medicine and scientific research. He was a Dutch scientist who lived in the 17th century. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek is often referred to as the Father of Microbiology and is renowned for his groundbreaking work in the field of microscopy. Van Leeuwenhoek's discoveries significantly advanced the understanding of the microscopic world and laid the foundation for modern microbiology. His contributions revolutionized the way we perceive the world and uncover the intricate details of living organisms. He also recognized the importance of the cell nucleus, discovered in 1831 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, and sensed its connection with cell division. The first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Jan Swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but had not published his findings at the time. One of the most notable figures associated with the microscope is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist in the 17th century. Leeuwenhoek is often considered the father of microbiology for his groundbreaking observations using microscopes he designed himself. He was the first to accurately describe and document microorganisms like bacteria, red blood cells, and spermatozoa.

Hendrix recorded the song in live, studio, and impromptu settings several times between 1967 and 1970, but never completed it to his satisfaction. Hendrix played the song solo as an acoustic guitar country-style blues and it is considered one of his most memorable performances. In 1973, it was included \n\n that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed \"Red House\" at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added \"I got to get out of here, because my Linda don't live here no more\" to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix' post-Experience groups, explained, \"As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place, or thing. It was just a blues number that Jimi put together\". One of his earliest recordings with his group the Jimi Hendrix Experience was his composition \"Red House\", a blues song inspired by Albert King, which is included on the 1967 UK Are You Experienced debut album. In their early years, the Experience adapted and frequently performed other blues songs, including Howlin' Wolf's \"Killing Floor\", B.B.

But in the 1960s and 1970s, the Spanish parliament agreed to allow provinces to use, speak, and print official documents in three other languages: Catalan for Catalonia, Balearic Islands and Valencia; Basque for the Basque provinces and Navarre, and Galician for Galicia. Under this system, some languages of Spain—such as Aranese (an Occitan language of northwestern Catalonia), Basque, Catalan/Valencian, and Galician—have gained co-official status in their respective geographical areas. Galician has also legal recognition in the Bierzo region in León, and in four municipalities in Zamora.

Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where \n\n Renn studied physics at the Free University of Berlin and at the Sapienza University of Rome. Between 1991 and 1996 he co-directed with Peter Damerow the \"Arbeitsstelle Albert Einstein\" at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900.\n\nQuestion: what college did albert einstein go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Whitney's invention made upland short cotton into a profitable crop, which strengthened the economic foundation of slavery in the United States. Despite the social and economic impact of his invention, Whitney lost many profits in legal battles over patent infringement for the cotton gin. Thereafter, he turned his attention into securing contracts with the government in the manufacture of muskets for the newly formed United States Army. Eli Whitney’s development of the cotton gin in the late 18th century contributed to the development of the area, and the Deep South as a whole, as it made mechanized processing of short-staple cotton profitable.

It was at this time that the fortress was converted into a royal palace, and Madrid became the capital of the Spanish Empire. Despite being a palace, the great building kept its original arabic title of Alcázar (English: \"castle\"). Its exterior was constructed by the architect Juan Gómez de Mora in 1636 on a commission from King Philip IV. As famous for its artistic treasures as it is for its unusual architecture, it was the residence of the Spanish Royal Family and home of the Court, until its destruction by fire during the reign of King Philip V (the first Bourbon king), on Christmas Eve 1734. The Salón de Reinos (translated as \"Hall of the Kingdoms\" or \"Hall of Realms\") or salón grande (\"great hall\") is a 17th-century building in Madrid, originally a wing of the Buen Retiro Palace. Built between 1630 and 1635, the Hall of Realms housed the largest paintings in the royal collection, now all in the Museo del Prado. The building served as the Museo del Ejército from 1841 to 2010 when the military collections were put on display at the Alcázar of Toledo. In addition, a Mass to celebrate the investiture of King Juan Carlos I was held here. In part, this link was cemented also because Madrid only completed its Cathedral of the Almudena in 1993.

Founded on March 31, 1782, it was the ninth Spanish mission established in Alta California (or Nueva California) and the last to be established by the head of the Franciscan missions in California, Junípero Serra. Designated a California Historical Landmark, the mission is one of many locally designated landmarks in downtown Ventura. The mission was named after St. Bonaventure, a 13th-century Franciscan saint, one of the early leaders of the Order to which the friars belonged, and a Doctor of the Church. Built at an unknown date between 1792 and 1809, it was located approximately five miles from the main mission, inland and upstream along the Ventura River. The Santa Gertrudis Asistencia was established as an asistencia or \"sub-mission\" of the Mission San Buenaventura, ministering to the Chumash people in the Ventura River valley where substantial agricultural activities were conducted. ; Mission Santa Clara de Asís, January 12, 1777, present-day city of Santa Clara, California, and ; Mission San Buenaventura, March 31, 1782, present-day Ventura, California. When the party reached San Diego on July 1, Serra stayed behind to start the Mission San Diego de Alcalá, the first of the 21 California missions (including the nearby Visita de la Presentación, also founded under Serra's leadership). Junipero Serra moved to the area that is now Monterey in 1770, and founded Mission San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo.

This led to the signing of the secret Treaty of London on 26 April by which Italy agreed to enter the war within one month. On 4 May Italy renounced the Triple Alliance, but did not yet enter the war in the side of the Entente as a majority in parliament continued to favour neutrality. The former Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was warned that Salandra intended to take the country to war, and on 9 May he returned to Rome to try to prevent this. On 10 May he tried to persuade King Victor Emmanuel that a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies would show that parliament did not support entry into the war. World War I has been \n\n Following the conclusion of World War I and the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, the vast majority of Dalmatia became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Italy entered the war on the side of the Entente in 1915, after the secret London Pact, which granted to Italy a large portion of Dalmatia. In recognition of his action Bava Beccaris received the Great Cross of the Order of Savoy from King Umberto I in June 1898. During 1914, he warmly supported the interventionist party in Italy who wished to participate in World War I, (as they did on 25 May 1915). In 1922, he recommended that King Victor Emmanuel III grant power to Benito Mussolini and the National Fascist Party. Unlike the German Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, Mussolini was officially only the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy. Initially the King and his staff (conscious of the Italian lack of preparation to war) did not approve Mussolini's intentions, but when France was clearly defeated in June 1940, the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) was abruptly sent to war. Mussolini made the mistake to believe that Britain would accept peace agreements with the Axis after France's surrender, and did not anticipate a long lasting war.\n\nQuestion: who was the italian leader in ww1?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Pathological Anatomy: Virchow published numerous papers on pathological anatomy and began his six-volume \"Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie\" (Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics) while at Würzburg. Cellular Pathology: Virchow formulated theories on cellular pathology during his time at Würzburg. Anthropological Work: Virchow started his anthropological work, studying the skulls of cretins and investigating the development of the base of the skull. His anthropological research contributed to the understanding of human anatomy and the effects of various conditions on skeletal structures. He focused on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, hospital design, meat inspection, and school hygiene. He supervised the design of two new Berlin hospitals, opened a nursing school, and designed the city's sewer system. Virchow's contributions had a profound impact on medicine and public health, shaping our understanding of diseases, promoting advancements in anatomical research, and advocating for healthcare improvements. The center derives its name from the pathologist Rudolf Virchow, who was a professor in Würzburg from 1849 to 1856 and was the first to postulate that diseases originated in dysfunctions of cells. Researchers at the Rudolf Virchow Center aim to trace diseases back to dysfunctions of proteins. The Rudolf Virchow Center also organizes a graduate program and several undergraduate programs in biomedicine and experimental medicine,. During the 19th century, Germany was the center of the medical world, and several influential physicians emerged during this time. Some notable figures were Kussmaul, Quincke, von Recklinghausen, Müller, and Schönlein. These physicians made significant contributions to medicine and clinical observation, and their relationships with Virchow played a crucial role in shaping their work. In particular, Virchow's relationships with his mentors Müller and Schönlein had a profound impact on the development of Kussmaul, Quincke, and von Recklinghausen as students of Virchow. Virchow, as a mentor, provided guidance and inspiration to his students, fostering an environment of scientific and intellectual growth. Von Recklinghausen, also a student of Virchow, had a significant impact on the field of medicine through his contributions to pathology and dermatology. In 1859 he was elected to the Berlin City Council, focusing his attention on public health matters, such as sewage disposal, the design of hospitals, meat inspection, and school hygiene.During much of this second Berlin period, Virchow actively engaged in politics.In 1856 a chair of pathological anatomy was established for Virchow at the University of Berlin.He pioneered the modern concept of pathological processes by his application of the cell theory to explain the effects of disease in the organs and tissues of the body. Moreover, he campaigned vigorously for social reforms and contributed to the development of anthropology as a modern science. In 1839 Virchow began the study of medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm Institute of the University of Berlin and was graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1843. At Würzburg Virchow published many papers on pathological anatomy. He began there the publication of his six-volume _Handbuch der speziellen Pathologie und Therapie_ (\"Handbook of Special Pathology and Therapeutics\"), most of the first volume of which he wrote himself. At Würzburg he also began to formulate his theories on cellular pathology and started his anthropological work with studies of the skulls of cretins (dwarfed, mentally deficient individuals) and investigations into the development of the base of the skull. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of cells and cancer. Although Virchow made significant contributions to cellular biology and our understanding of cancer, it is important to mention that he rejected the notion that bacteria can cause disease and the value of cleanliness in preventing infection. His contributions laid the foundation for further research in the field of biology and continue to influence the fields of molecular biology and genetics today.\n\nQuestion: where did rudolf virchow conduct his research?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Since drafting Russell Wilson in 2012, the Seahawks have completely dominated the rivalry, holding a 17–4 record against the 49ers in that span. The Tip, sometimes referred to as the Immaculate Deflection, was a play in the American football 2013–14 NFL 2013 NFC Championship Game in the National Football League between the #5 seeded San Francisco 49ers and the #1 seeded Seattle Seahawks. The game was played in Lumen Field (known as CenturyLink Field at the time), Seattle, Washington and, being the NFC Championship Game, was televised nationally on Fox. With 0:30 left in regulation, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick threw a pass to Michael Crabtree in the right corner of the endzone. With the win, the Seahawks advanced to just the second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, in which they defeated the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first Super Bowl win. The Tip is often considered one of the biggest moments in Seattle Seahawks history. In Week 15, the Seahawks shut the New York Giants out, winning 23–0. The Seahawks defense held eventual 2014 NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers to just 178 yards passing and one touchdown pass with two interceptions (which went to Sherman and Maxwell).

The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but, whereas the book is solely an explanation of cosmology, the film is, additionally, a biography of Hawking's life, featuring interviews with some of his family members and colleagues. Stephen Hawking has lived with ALS for the majority of his life. He's pictured delivering a lecture to mark NASA's 50th anniversary in 2008. Its symptoms mimic those of other diseases (such as Parkinson's) and there isn't one test to spot it. Often doctors will rule out other diseases to arrive at a diagnosis. British physicist Stephen Hawking has defied the odds, living for more than 45 years with the disease. Hawking was diagnosed at 21, while a graduate student at Cambridge University. He has been wheelchair-bound since the 1970s. In 1985, he developed pneumonia and had to have a tracheotomy operation, which robbed him of his ability to speak. When a computer whiz in California heard of Hawking's plight, he sent him a computer program called Equalizer that could speak for him. Since then, Hawking has become known for the synthesized, computer-generated voice that enables him to speak. Determined early on not to let the disease steal his life, Hawking went on to become one of the world's preeminent physicists. He published the best-selling book, \"A Brief History of Time,\" and he has made great contributions to the fields of quantum gravity and cosmology. The Universe in a Nutshell is a 2001 book about theoretical physics by Stephen Hawking. It is generally considered a sequel and was created to update the public concerning developments since the multi-million-copy bestseller A Brief History of Time was published in 1988. In it Hawking explains to a general audience various matters relating to the Lucasian professor's work, such as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and P-branes (part of superstring theory in quantum mechanics). He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to \"combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\"\n\nQuestion: what did stephen hawking become famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An estimated 59% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often colloquially referred to as Flemish), and French is spoken by 40%. Total Dutch speakers number 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers comprise 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (85%) of the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.

Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. It stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly, Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ken Stott, Aidan Turner, Dean O'Gorman, Billy Connolly, Graham McTavish, James Nesbitt, Stephen Fry and Ryan Gage. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film received a nomination for Best Sound Editing. Major pairings include those between the hobbits Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, the three of them linked by the Ring, by friendship, and by bonds of loyalty and of oath. This enables Tolkien to portray the good and evil sides of Frodo's character. The unheroic Frodo is further contrasted with the plainly heroic Aragorn. Among the kingly figures, the unhappy Steward of Gondor, Denethor, is paired both with the future king Aragorn and with the bold king of Rohan, Théoden. The BBC's Nicholas Barber wrote that with The Hobbit series, Jackson had succeeded in bridging the gap between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and that The Battle of the Five Armies was a \"colossal technical achievement\", but he also criticised the film for not being compelling because of \"its repetitive battle scenes and a lack of plot\". Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times said \"Bilbo may fully learn a sense of friendship and duty, and have quite a story to tell, but somewhere along the way, Mr. Jackson loses much of the magic.\"\n\nQuestion: who played bilbo in lord of the rings?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Head coach Mike Tomlin stated a wish to simply play the game and not allow for any show of support one way or the other on the issue. ; In 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the National Anthem in protest of police violence, which led to widespread controversy surrounding the national anthem. ; The NFL initially stated they would fine players for wearing September 11 attacks tribute cleats, which the NFL ultimately did not do due to backlash. ; As mentioned above, during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 seasons, many NFL players from all 32 NFL teams have protested during the national anthem due to police brutality, racial inequality, and other controversies around the nation surrounding politics and authority.

Trump suggested that those who partake in the practice were disrespecting the country's heritage, and asked his audience, \"wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. The Pittsburgh Steelers (with the exception of offensive tackle and former Army Ranger Alejandro Villanueva), Tennessee Titans and Seattle Seahawks chose to not go out on field at all during the anthem. This movement was enacted primarily by NFL athletes, most notably Colin Kaepernick, through kneeling for the duration of the national anthem; this act has stirred significant controversy because it is interpreted by nationalists as being a disrespectful act that insults the American flag, veterans, and the values the flag represents. This movement ultimately led to #BoycottNFL and controversy that resulted in the NFL ban requiring players to stand for the national anthem, or stay in the locker room. The gesture originated in a 2016 American football game, during which Colin Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate Eric Reid chose to kneel during the playing of the US national anthem, to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. \"After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest,\" said Reid.\n\nQuestion: what team does colin kaepernick play for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The mouvement was never made official with documents signed by members of a list of criteria in order for work to be considered Fauvism, but it was simply a small group of mainly French painters who used brilliant colour and unexpected brushstrokes, similar to the German Expressionism mouvement. Matisse created the Fauve style after experimenting with post-impressionistic painters, such as Gauguin, Cézanne and Van Gogh, as well as the Neo-impressionism of Cross, Signac and Seurat. All these painters inspired Matisse to reject 3D uses of spaces and use colour and mouvement to create 2D planes of space. design oriented paintings significantly influenced Modern art. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, André Derain, Fauvism, Cubism, and Orphism, among others. As his secretary, \"Madame Lydia\" made it possible for him to produce his final masterpieces in the face of his infirmity and failing health, which resulted in abstraction, a shift from oil paint on canvas to printing and paper, thus creating \"a life's work\" in Matisse's words. His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way for Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism.\n\nQuestion: what artistic movement did henri matisse belong to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Missouri traditionally had been called the longest river in North America. However, 72 miles of it have been trimmed off in re-channeling its streambed—mainly for the many hydroelectric power plants in the region— so that it is now sometimes referred as second to the Mississippi in terms of length. If the Jefferson were included in the Missouri length, it would technically still be considered the longest river by experts of the United States Geological Survey.

However, according to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. The 1905 law on secularity was highly controversial at the time, but today is held as a founding document of French secularism or laïcité. Some French politicians and communities have more recently questioned the law, arguing that, despite its explicit stance for state secularism, it de facto favors traditional French religions, in particular the Catholic Church, at the expense of more recently established religions, such as Islam. The law provides for the transfer to \n\n moderately powerful countries or countries with whom the French state had no privileged relationships.

Kollerup has been a member of Folketinget since the 2011 elections.

With the result beyond doubt on election night, Rasmussen conceded defeat and Frederiksen has been commissioned by Queen Margrethe II to lead the negotiations to form a new government. Despite having run on an anti-immigration stance during the election, Frederiksen shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing government plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government.

The Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the Ohio Country and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes inhabiting the lands in what is now Upstate New York along the shores of Lake Ontario east to Lake Champlain and Lake George on the Hudson river, and the lower-estuary of the Saint Lawrence River. The Iroquois Confederation led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely Algonquian-speaking tribes and Iroquoian-speaking Huron and related tribes of the Great Lakes region. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as 1,000 BCE, and these communities celebrated by the gift-giving feast of the potlatch. In present-day upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal nations in the mid-15th century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the United States government. The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans. As their territory expanded, smaller tribes were forced further west, including the Osage, Kaw, Ponca, and Omaha peoples. The Onondaga people (Onondaga: Onöñda’gaga’, Hill Place people) are one of the original five constituent nations of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy in northeast North America. Their traditional homeland is in and around present-day Onondaga County, New York, south of Lake Ontario. They are known as Gana’dagwëni:io’geh to the other Iroquois tribes. they began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of Lake Ontario and west of the Hudson River. These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy.\n\nQuestion: where did the iroquois indians come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Navajo is an Athabaskan language of the Na-Dené family, with 178,000 speakers, primarily in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Altogether, Navajo speakers make up more than 50% of all Native American language speakers in the United States. Western Apache, with 12,500 speakers, also mostly in Arizona, is closely related to Navajo but not mutually intelligible with it. Navajo and other Athabaskan languages in the Southwest are relative outliers; most other Athabascan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Navajo has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs in the Navajo Nation, including a Navajo language immersion school in Fort Defiance, Arizona. The NLA organizes efforts of linguists and language instructors to train teachers of Navajo. Summer workshops on the Navajo language, applied linguistics, and general linguistics have been offered every summer since 1997. The NLA differs from such related organizations as the Navajo Nation Division of Diné Education, Diné College, and the Navajo Language Teachers Association in focusing on scientific research on the Navajo language and on teaching Navajo people, especially language teachers, how to carry out linguistic research and to use existing reference materials. The Board of Directors of the NLA includes Navajo linguist Ellavina Perkins. The NLA maintains a comprehensive bibliography on Navajo linguistics, available on its web site, and holds the archive of the Navajo material of linguist Ken Hale.

Dene or Dine (the Athabaskan languages) is a widely distributed group of Native languages spoken by associated peoples in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Alaska, parts of Oregon, northern California, and the American Southwest as far as northern Mexico. The southwestern division of Athabaskan is also called Southern Athabaskan or Apachean, and includes Navajo and all the Apache languages. Eyak was spoken in south-central Alaska; the last first language speaker died in 2008.

The unexpected tendency of consumers to spend their legacy currency, rather than exchange it at banks, led to temporary shortages of euro small change, with some consumers being given change in legacy currency.

In early work, Rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation. In 1911, the Rutherfords built a new house adjacent to the University of Alberta campus. Rutherford named it \"Archnacarry\", after his ancestral homeland in Scotland. Rutherford identified beta rays as cathode rays (electrons), and hypothesised—and in 1909 with Thomas Royds proved—that alpha particles were helium nuclei. Rutherford proposed a model of the atom in which a very small, dense and positively charged nucleus of protons was surrounded by orbiting, negatively charged electrons (the Rutherford model). Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near Ormond, Canada West, on his family's dairy farm. Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a Metcalfe high school. After graduating in 1874, he attended the Canadian Literary Institute, a Baptist college in Woodstock. He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the Ottawa law firm of \n\n the first Oceanian Nobel laureate, and the first to perform the awarded work in Canada. Rutherford moved in 1907 to the Victoria University of Manchester (today University of Manchester) in the UK, where he and Thomas Royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. In 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative, he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus, and thereby pioneered the Rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of Rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden.\n\nQuestion: what school did sir ernest rutherford go to?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard College is Harvard University's traditional undergraduate program, offering AB and SB degrees. Harvard College students participate in more than 450 extracurricular organizations and nearly all live on campus—first-year students in or near Harvard Yard, and upperclass students in community-oriented \"houses\". Massachusetts Hall is the oldest surviving building at Harvard College, the first institution of higher learning in the British colonies in America, and second oldest academic building in the United States after the Wren Building at the College of William & Mary. Massachusetts Hall was designed by Harvard Presidents John Leverett and his successor Benjamin Wadsworth. It was erected between 1718 and 1720 in Harvard Yard. Massachusetts Hall, as Harvard's oldest extant dormitory, has housed many influential people. Founding fathers who lived in Massachusetts Hall include John Adams, John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Elbridge Gerry, and James Otis. Members of the Wigglesworth, Weld, Thayer, Eliot, and Lowell families (among others), whose names now grace other dormitories, also lived in Massachusetts Hall. chemistry building, with a laboratory and classrooms, and later housed the anatomical museum of Jeffries Wyman, Professor of Comparative Anatomy, who in 1866 became the first curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, as well as a mineralogical collection. In the 20th century, it became the first home of the Harvard-Yenching Institute. It houses the offices of the Harvard Classics Department.

Laos is a landlocked country in Southeast Asia, bordered by Burma and People's Republic of China to the northwest, Vietnam to the east, Cambodia to the south and Thailand to the west. Laos traces its history to the Kingdom of Lan Xang or Land of a Million Elephants, which existed from the 14th to the 18th century. Thailand's northeastern region, Isan, has particularly strong Lao roots. Diplomacy has concentrated on the Mekong River, seeking to make it a \"river of true peace and friendship\", as made explicit in statements by both respective prime ministers in 1976. Laos is represented by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Hanoi for ROC-related matters. Relations have consisted of trade and aid, largely focused on road construction in the northern provinces of Laos, without directly challenging the interests of Thailand or Vietnam in the central and southern regions. Laos developed its culture and customs as the inland crossroads of trade and migration in Southeast Asia over millennia. As of 2012 Laos has a population of roughly 6.4 million spread over 236,800 km2 (91,400 sq miles), yielding one of the lowest population densities in Asia. Yet the country of Laos has an official count of over forty-seven ethnicities divided into 149 sub-groups and 80 different languages. In Southeast Asia, traditional Lao culture is considered one of the Indic cultures (along with Burma, Thailand and Cambodia). Laos is geographically isolated and mountainous, bounded by the Annamite Range in the east, forming a traditional political and cultural boundary with Vietnam (a more Chinese influenced Sinitic culture).\n\nQuestion: where is laos in world map?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is commonly defined as the region from below Hoover Dam and Lake Mead to its outlet at the northern Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez); it includes the Colorado River proper, canyons, the valley, mountain ranges with wilderness areas, and the floodplain and associated riparian environments. Central Colorado is home to most of the population of the state and its geography is dominated by the Rocky Mountains, their foothills, mesas, and canyons, the rivers that run through them, and the open plains off the foothills. Flowing through the U.S. states of Colorado and Nebraska, it is itself a major river of the American Midwest and the American Southwest/Mountain West. Its drainage basin includes much of the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, much of the populated region known as the Colorado Front Range and Eastern Plains, and a portion of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne. The river serves as the principal source of water for eastern Colorado. In its valley along the foothills in Colorado, it has permitted agriculture in an area of the Colorado Piedmont and Great Plains that is otherwise arid. This is a list of drainage basins in the U.S. State of Colorado. The U.S. State of Colorado includes the headwaters of several important rivers. East of the Continental Divide, surface waters flow to the Gulf of Mexico, either via the Rio Grande or via one of several rivers (the South Platte River, the North Platte River, the Republican River, the Arkansas River, the Cimarron River, or the Canadian River) which eventually feed the Mississippi River along the way.

In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked Costello number 80 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Costello began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album My Aim Is \n\n Blood & Chocolate is the eleventh studio album by the British rock singer and songwriter Elvis Costello, released in the United Kingdom as Demon Records XFIEND 80, and in the United States as Columbia 40518. The recording of Blood & Chocolate was troubled, as the relationship between Costello and the Attractions had deteriorated during sessions for King of America. Nieve played piano, organ and other keyboard instruments on most of Costello's projects over the next ten years, including the albums This Year's Model (1978), Imperial Bedroom (1982) and Blood & Chocolate (1986). On the 1984 Costello album Goodbye Cruel World and its accompanying tour, he was credited as \"Maurice Worm.\" He wrote some material on The Attractions' Costello-less album, Mad About the Wrong Boy under the name Norman Brain, in collaboration with his then girlfriend, Fay Hart. The release was accompanied by a newly created music video that featured clips from previous Elvis Costello music videos. City Pages named the song one of Costello's 30 best deep cuts, praising the \"buoyant bounce underpinning some of Costello's darkest lyrics\" on the track. Tony Clayton-Lea of the Irish Times described the song as one of Costello's \"back-catalogue gems\" and praised the \"staccato backdrop\" and \"spooky vocal\". of Costello's albums since the mid-1990s, including 1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration Painted From Memory, 2001's Anne Sofie von Otter collaboration For the Stars and 2003's North. In 2001 Costello formed a new backing band consisting of Nieve, Attractions drummer Pete Thomas, and bassist Davey Faragher. Elvis Costello & the Imposters have toured extensively and released the albums When I Was Cruel (2002), Cruel Smile (2003), The Delivery Man (2004), The River in Reverse (2006) with Allen Toussaint and Momofuku (2008), National Ransom (2010), and Look Now (2018).\n\nQuestion: where was elvis costello born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. This established the superior relationship that federal laws have with regards to conflicting State laws and was a critical moment for federalism in the United States. The most basic features of republicanism anywhere are a representational government in which citizens elect leaders from among themselves for a predefined term, as opposed to a permanent ruling class or aristocracy, and laws are passed by these leaders for the benefit of the entire republic. In addition, unlike a direct or \"pure\" democracy in which the majority vote rules, a republic codifies in a charter or constitution a certain set of basic civil rights that is guaranteed to every citizen and cannot be overridden by majority rule.

This canal cuts through the Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, shaving off more than 9000 mi for ships, instead of having them travel around the tip of Cape Horn in South America. On 19 June 1998, the government of Panama turned over control to the private Panama Canal Railway Company (\"PCRC\"). The Panama Railway was originally broad gauge, but when it was rebuilt in 2000, the gauge was changed to. The route is 47.6 mi long across the Isthmus of Panama from Colón (Atlantic) to Balboa (Pacific, near Panama City). As of 2015, Panama Canal Railway Company runs both passenger and freight trains between Panama City and Colón. The cut forms part of the Panama Canal, linking Gatun Lake, and thereby the Atlantic Ocean, to the Gulf of Panama and hence the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal Railway (Ferrocarril de Panamá) is a railway line linking the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in Central America. The route stretches 47.6 mi across the Isthmus of Panama from Colón (Atlantic) to Balboa (Pacific, near Panama City). Opened in 1855, the railway preceded the Panama Canal by half a century; the railway was vital in assisting the construction of the canal in the early 1900s. With the opening of the canal, the railroad's route was changed as a result of the creation of Gatun \n\n and from the West Coast, the United States again turned its attention to securing a safe, reliable, and speedy link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser, which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The Boxer is a member of both The Kennel Club and American Kennel Club (AKC) Working Group. Based on 2013 AKC statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff.

Bulldogs are typically stocky, powerful, square-built animals with large, strong, brachycephalic-type muzzles. It is believed bulldogs were developed during the 16th century in the Elizabethan era from the larger mastiffs, as smaller, more compact dogs were better suited for baiting.\n\nQuestion: where do american bulldogs originate from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The book provides an overview of the historical and philosophical debates that have continued throughout the history of evolutionary theory, and carry on to this day in debates surrounding the merits of gene-centric selection and group selection models. The book is particularly critical of the popular science author Richard Dawkins, claiming that he presents a brand of evolutionary theory that portrays natural selection as acting at the level of the individual gene to the exclusion of group selection models which state that it could also act at the level of organisms or species. The book also claims Dawkins embraces an outdated and prescriptive conception of evolution that actually restricts debate rather than promoting it. In the opening scene, Richard Dawkins responds very precisely to what he views as a misrepresentation of his first book, The Selfish Gene. Dawkins has examined this issue throughout his career and focused much of his documentary The Genius of Charles Darwin on this very issue. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins described himself as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction. The book has provoked controversy with some online commentary claiming it is another 'flea', a term used by Dawkins to describe people who have published books about him or his ideas. Popular Science author Brian Clegg reviewed the book and described it as brilliantly identifying how Dawkins' views sit within the latest theories on evolution.\n\nQuestion: which dawkins book to read first?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Nikola Tesla faced resistance and eventually became forgotten over time for several reasons. One major reason was his unconventional and visionary ideas that often challenged the established scientific and economic interests of his time. Tesla's inventions and concepts, such as wireless transmission of energy and alternating current (AC), threatened the financial interests of the prominent figures in the electricity industry, such as Thomas Edison. This led to conflicts and competition that worked against Tesla's recognition and acceptance. Furthermore, Tesla's eccentric personality and unconventional lifestyle also contributed to his resistance and subsequent downfall. Tesla's focus on his scientific pursuits rather than commercialization hindered his ability to market and promote his inventions effectively. This setback was a significant blow to Tesla's reputation and legacy, as it showcased his inability to turn his extraordinary ideas into practical and profitable ventures. Edison engaged in a bitter rivalry with Tesla, which influenced public opinion and further marginalized Tesla's achievements. Over time, the lack of recognition, financial struggles, and overshadowing by competing inventors led to Tesla's fading from the public eye.\n\nQuestion: what was nikola tesla inventions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They are one of two principal ethnic groups in Belgium, the other being the French-speaking Walloons. \"Flemish\" was historically a geographical term, as all inhabitants of the medieval County of Flanders in modern-day Belgium, France, and the Netherlands were referred to as \"Flemings\", irrespective of their ethnicity or language. The contemporary region of Flanders comprises a part of this historical county, as well as parts of the medieval duchy of Brabant and the medieval county of Loon, where the modern Flemish ethnic group and culture gradually formed. In the history of art and other fields, the adjectives Flemish and Netherlandish are commonly used to designate all the artistic production in this area before about 1580, after which it refers specifically to the southern Netherlands. For example, the term \"Flemish Primitives\", now outdated in English but used in French, Dutch and other languages, is a synonym for \"Early Netherlandish painting\", and it is not uncommon to see Mosan art categorized as Flemish art. The government's long refusal to acknowledge Dutch as an official language led to hostilities between Flanders and the French-speaking bourgeoisie who held both political and economic power. These hostilities gave rise to the Flemish movement, which began as a literary and cultural organization, but later became a political movement that called for legal recognition of Dutch and for social emancipation of the Flemish people. While a Walloon industrial and mining base developed during the 19th century, the largely agrarian Flanders area \n\n Ghent which, though situated in largely Dutch-speaking Flanders, taught exclusively in French. In 1915, the Governor General decided to launch the Flamenpolitik (Flemish Policy) to use the animosity between the two language groups to facilitate the administration of the territory and to portray the occupation regime as the liberation of Flanders. The policy was especially advocated by pan-Germanists, like the Alldeutscher Verband, who believed that the Flemish shared racial traits with the Germans that the Walloons did not.\n\nQuestion: where did flemish people come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Wing-Chun kung fu teacher, Jeet Kune Do founder, and Chinese/Hollywood movie legend Bruce Lee. Hong Kong cinema historian Bey Logan says Lewis was the original pick of Bruce Lee for the villain Colt in Way of the Dragon, but that Lee and Lewis had a falling out before the film and thus Chuck Norris was tapped instead. \"He had the best doctors, and they think they did a good job of getting it all out,\" said Dennis Nackord, Lewis' senior black belt. Lewis died one year and forty-five days later, on the morning of August 31, 2012, at Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Lee retired to his Prato Rio property in the Shenandoah Valley, where he bred horses and dogs. Despite a provision of his will that denounced organized religion and specifically forbade burial near a church or religious meeting house, his remains were taken to the City Tavern for friends and dignitaries to pay their respects, then a military escort took his remains to Christ Church, where after a brief Anglican service, Lee was buried in the churchyard in an unmarked grave. No single figure was more responsible for this international profile than Bruce Lee, an American-born, Hong Kong-raised martial artist and actor. Lee completed just four movies before his death at the age of 32: The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon (both 1972), and Enter the Dragon (1973).

The strong bulwarks still seen today surrounding the base of the tower are believed to have been built by king Herod, in memorial of his brother, and was formerly named the Tower of Phasael (מגדל פצאל). During the Jewish war with Rome, Simon bar Giora made the tower his place of residence. dozens of towns, the restoration of large agriculture, and the construction of hundreds of churches, cathedrals, and castles. In 1187, with the Muslim world united under the effective leadership of Saladin, Jerusalem was re-conquered \n\n The Broad Wall (החומה הרחבה HaChoma HaRechava) is an ancient defensive wall in the Old City of Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter. The unbroken length of wall uncovered by Avigad's dig runs 65 m long and is preserved in places to a height of 3.3 m. It was long believed that the city in this period was confined to the fortified, narrow hill running to the south of the Temple Mount known as the City of David. Avigad's dig demonstrated that by the late eighth century the city had expanded to include the hill to the west of the Temple Mount. According to Jewish tradition, as expressed in the Tanakh, Jerusalem remained a Jebusite city until the rise of David, who conquered Jebus, renamed it City of David and started expanding it. Solomon, David's son, built the First Temple on the hilltop rising right above the city he had inherited, the Temple Mount, and then extended the city walls in order to protect the temple. The entire city was destroyed in 587/86 BCE during the siege led by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.\n\nQuestion: where was the city of david?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

An example is \"Suzy Lake As Patty Hearst\", a project Lake made in collaboration with Bill Jones, featuring the artist as the eponymous Hearst. American artist Cindy Sherman has cited Lake's photo-performance as an influence on her work. Suzy Lake has twenty-five portfolios of her artwork. Their early work, in particular, is typically characterized by their critical appropriation of images from the mainstream media. Dwyer and her contemporaries approached the image-saturated pop cultural landscape with a sense of suspicion and irony, even black comedy. Some of her works of art include ID-400, OMIAI♡, Costume, Schoolgirls, Costume, Cover, Masquerade, Recruit, Mirrors, and Facial Signature. Sawada's photographs are each part of a themed photo series in which she makes use of make-up and costume to dramatically alter her identity, such that each photograph appears to represent a different individual or group of individuals, when all subjects are Sawada herself. Sawada uses commercial photographers, photo booths, and her own studio environment with digital photo editing to represent hundreds of different identities. Tomoko's use of costume in her self-portraits draws inspiration from the work of Cindy Sherman.

He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. Aristotle has been called \"the father of logic\", \"the father of biology\", \"the father of political science\", \"the father of zoology\", \"the father of embryology\", \"the father of natural law\", \"the father of scientific method\", \"the father of rhetoric\", \"the father of psychology\", \"the father of realism\", \"the father of criticism\", \"the father of individualism\", \"the father of teleology\", and \"the father of meteorology\". Aristotle ( Aristotélēs, ; 384–322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject\n\nQuestion: what are aristotle's contributions to science?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Under the present Constitution of Japan, the Emperor is \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\". Other members of the Imperial Family perform ceremonial and social duties, but have no role in the affairs of government. The duties as an Emperor are passed down the line to their male children.

Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving approximately 135,000 dead; another 130,000 would die from radiation sickness and other bomb-related illnesses in the following five years. Supporters of the bombings argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives \n\n The city of Sendai was the largest population and commercial center of the Tohoku region of northern Honshu island, but lacked specific targets of strategic military significance. The industrial city of Kamaishi was bombed on July 14, 1945, which was also the first air raid experienced in Miyagi Prefecture during the war. The first experience of Sendai with bombing was on March 10, 1945, when three B-29 Superfortress bombers from the Tokyo Air Raid dropped their bomb load on Mount Zaō for unknown reasons, killing 34 civilians, and an additional two B-29 bombers attacked Sendai Airport causing minor damage. On May 25, 1945, a photo-reconnaissance B-29 overflew Sendai at an altitude of 8000 feet, compiling a detailed map of the downtown area of the city. On July 10, 1945, another B-29 made an over flight of Sendai, this time dropping propaganda leaflets warning the residents of the city of its imminent destruction. After securing airfields in Saipan and Guam in the summer of 1944, the United States Army Air Forces undertook an intense strategic bombing campaign, using incendiary bombs, burning Japanese cities in an effort to pulverize Japan's industry and shatter its morale. Approximately 350,000–500,000 civilians died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of the incendiary bombing campaign on Japan. The bombs killed as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 80,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945.\n\nQuestion: what places in japan were bombed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This has allowed China to rely on savings-financed investments for economic growth. However, because low returns also dampens consumer spending, household expenditures account for \"a smaller share of GDP in China than in any other major economy\". At China's 1.6% inflation rate, this is a \"high real-interest rate compared to other major economies\". China is considering taking policy steps to double average wages over the five years from 2011, and several Chinese provinces raised the legal minimum wage. State media also stated that higher wages will help boost domestic consumption and help move China away from a reliance on exports for growth towards an economy more driven by domestic consumption. Economist Andy Xie said that there is ample scope for increased wages in China due to its superior infrastructure as compared to competing, low-wage alternative nations. In recent years Guangxi's economy has languished behind that of its wealthy neighbor and twin, Guangdong. Chinese people escalating demand for consumption, increasing demand for consumption comes from two major factors in China.

There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder. At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period. When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother's health, she left with Gypsy for the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. They spent most of their time visiting various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, seeking treatment of the illnesses Clauddine claimed Gypsy had, which she now said included hearing and vision problems. While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter's other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments. Clauddine said Gypsy's medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. Her  height, nearly toothless mouth, large glasses and high, childlike voice reinforced the perception that she had all the problems her mother said she did. The lack of salivary glands coupled with side-effects of the anti-seizure medication she was given caused Gypsy's teeth to decay to the point that the majority of her front teeth were extracted and replaced by a bridge. Tubes were implanted in her ears to control her myriad of purported ear infections. Suspicions of deceptive behavior\nBernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian. After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that Gypsy's original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's self-reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all Gypsy's records had been destroyed by flooding. He suspected the possibility of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him. Flasterstein did not follow up by reporting Dee Dee to social services. He said he had been told by other doctors to treat the pair with \"golden gloves\" and doubted the authorities would believe him anyway. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. After they had returned home and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, he went to the Blanchard house. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. The media in Springfield soon reported the truth of the Blanchards' lives: that Gypsy had never been sick and had always been able to walk, but her mother had made her pretend otherwise, using physical abuse to control her. Arnott urged people not to donate any money to the family until investigators learned the extent of the fraud. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. However, she said, Godejohn never told her what he thought about the pregnancy plan. Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. In popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Television\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017.

Aftermath and reactions\n\nCommunity response\nThe Blanchards' neighbors were shocked to learn that Gypsy's illnesses were fabricated. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Her mother recalled how everyone had accepted Dee Dee's claims without asking for proof, and wondered if the mother and daughter had been secretly laughing at their neighbors' naïveté. However, a lot of times we are deceived, and I think this is now so true, in this case at hand.\" Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. Her father, stepmother, and the nephew who first shared details of Gypsy's actual health when she was first confined to a wheelchair all later said that Dee Dee deserved her fate and Gypsy had been punished as much as she needed to be. He was happy the first time that he saw a video of Gypsy walking under her own power. When she did, she told BuzzFeed reporter Michelle Dean that she had been able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy on prison computers, and her mother had every symptom. \"I think she would have been the perfect mom for someone that actually was sick,\" she said. She believed Dee Dee's claim that she had cancer, even though she knew she could walk and eat solid food, leading her to assent to the regular head shavings. However, she always hoped that doctors would see through the ruse, and she was frustrated that none besides Flasterstein did. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. Nonetheless, she has said that she hopes to help other abused victims. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. He told Dean he wished he could have done more. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. The film accepts Flasterstein's claim that he was only required to make a report to Child Protective Services in the latter instance, but according to Feldman once he had included Munchausen by proxy in his list of possible diagnoses, he was obligated to make a report. \"This conundrum arises in case after case, where innumerable doctors have evaluated the patient, perhaps had questions they kept to themselves, and just proceeded to treat or make referrals and ditch the case that way.\" While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. In popular culture\n\nFilms\nHBO produced the documentary film Mommy Dead and Dearest directed by Erin Lee Carr about the murder and its relationship to Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Television\nThe CBS network talk show Dr. Phil, episode \"Mother Knows Best: A Story of Munchausen by Proxy and Murder\" featuring interviews with Gypsy Rose, her father and step-mother, premiered on November 21, 2017. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider.\n\nQuestion: what did drita find out?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Latinus was worshiped on Mons Albanus (Monte Albano) during an annual festival attended by all Latins, including those from Rome, one of the Latin states.

In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory. Anglicans of the Anglo-Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief. It further involves questions regarding the afterlife, e.g. The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that after the body dies, the soul is judged, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented mortal sin go to hell. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry venial sin go to a place called Purgatory where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

Linnaeus was born in Råshult, the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also \n\n The 12th edition of Systema Naturae was the last edition of Systema Naturae to be overseen by its author, Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus had originally invented this system for botanical names in his 1753 work Species Plantarum, and presented it again in 1758 in the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae for more than 4,000 animal species. With this book anybody, \n\nCarl Linnaeus's development of taxonomic systems and technical terminologies significantly contributed to the emergence of a new research object in botany: the 'natural' system. During the time of Linnaeus, there was an increasing amount of information on previously unknown plant and animal species, leading to a concept known as 'information overload.' In order to effectively organize and handle this wealth of information, Linnaeus created taxonomic systems, rules of nomenclature, and technical terminologies. By creating a standardized system for classifying and naming plants, Linnaeus provided botanists with a common language and framework for studying and categorizing different species. Additionally, Linnaeus's taxonomic system allowed for the comparison and classification of plants based on their shared characteristics and relationships. By organizing plants into clusters and hierarchies, Linnaeus enabled researchers to identify patterns and similarities among different species, which opened up new avenues for studying their biological and ecological features. Furthermore, Linnaeus's development of technical terminologies provided researchers with specific vocabulary and descriptive terms to accurately communicate and document their observations. Ultimately, Linnaeus's work laid the foundation for the emergence of the 'natural' system, which continues to be a fundamental aspect of botanical research today.\n\nQuestion: who was carolus linnaeus?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The federal system has, since 1949, been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Germany is part of the Schengen Area, and has been a member of the eurozone since 1999. It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20 and the OECD. The politics of Hesse takes place within a framework of a federal parliamentary representative democratic republic, where the Federal Government of Germany exercises sovereign rights with certain powers reserved to the states of Germany including Hesse. The state has a multi-party system where, as in most other states of former Western Germany and the federal level, the two main parties are the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the states Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the state parliament is called Bürgerschaft (Citizenry), in Berlin it is called Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Representatives). The state has a multiparty system dominated by the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU). Bavaria has long been a bastion of conservative politics in Germany, with the Christian Social Union has won every election of the state parliament since 1946 and having almost a monopoly on power. On the other hand the bigger and more liberal, or rather social democratic, cities, especially Munich, have been governed for decades by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) until recently the second biggest party.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does germany have now?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Fighting between different factions escalated in 2014, with the House of Representatives, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, being the main political force claiming to be the legitimate government of Libya. A civil war has been ongoing in Libya since 2014, and after 2016 the country was mainly divided between the Tobruk-based House of Representatives in the east, and the Government of National Accord in Tripoli and western Libya. The rival governments both claim to be the legitimate government of Libya. The GNA is internationally recognised by the United Nations Security Council as the government of Libya, though the LNA receives support from several countries, including Russia, United Arab Emirates, and France. In December 2015, the Libyan Political Agreement was signed after talks in Skhirat, as the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in Tripoli, Tobruk, and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the Government of National Accord. On 30 March 2016, Fayez Sarraj, the head of GNA, arrived in Tripoli and began working from there despite opposition from GNC.

Some areas (including the state of Baja California) change on the second Sunday in March and the first Sunday in November, matching the schedule in most of the U.S.A.. Some others, including Quintana Roo and Sonora, do not observe DST.

He served both as Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England. His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method or simply, the scientific method. —Francis Bacon (1605) The Advancement of Learning, Book 1, v, 8\" Francis Bacon (1561–1626) entered Trinity College, Cambridge in April 1573, where he applied himself diligently to the several sciences as then taught, and came to the conclusion that the methods employed and the results attained were alike erroneous; he learned to despise the current Aristotelian philosophy. With this conception in his mind, Bacon \n\n he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as Lord Chancellor. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon Baron Verulam, of Verulam, in the Peerage of England; he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam. Bacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage, as Viscount St Alban, on 27 January 1621.\n\n wife Barbara met astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at a reception at 10 Downing Street.

On January 11, 1935, Amelia Earhart became the first person to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii to Oakland, California. On St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1937, Earhart and her crew, Paul Mantz, Harry Manning and Fred Noonan, flew the first leg of her attempt to circumnavigate the globe, from Oakland to Honolulu, Hawaii. Later in the year, Earhart began her second, ill-fated attempt with the unpublicized first leg of her proposed transcontinental flight mapped from Oakland to Miami, Florida. Earhart devoted significant time to coordinating Amelia's posthumous affairs, setting up donations, marshalling information, and dealing with Amelia's fans. She corresponded with museums, aviation clubs, the U.S. Air Force, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Earhart also spoke out against the speculations that arose in the wake of Amelia's death. She denied, for example, that her sister died while on a spy mission, as some theorists have past suggested. Earhart wrote two books about Amelia, Courage is the Price and Amelia, My Courageous Sister.

He transformed European theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through innovation in characterization, plot, language and genre. Shakespeare's writings have also impacted many notable novelists and poets over the years, including Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, and Maya Angelou, and continue to influence new authors even today. Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the history of the English-speaking world after the various writers of the Bible; many of his quotations and neologisms have passed into everyday usage in English and other languages. According to Guinness Book of World Records Shakespeare remains the world’s best-selling playwright, with sales of his plays and poetry believed to have achieved in excess of four billion copies in the almost 400 years since his death. His plays exhibited \"spectacular violence, with loose and episodic plotting, and with a mingling of comedy with tragedy\". Shakespeare's work is also lauded for its insight into emotion. The histories—along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays. He \n\n Shakespeare's works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre. Shakespeare created some of the most admired plays in Western literature (with Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear being ranked among the world's greatest plays),  and transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through plot and language. Specifically, in plays like Hamlet, Shakespeare \"integrated characterization with plot,\" such that if the main character was different in any way, the plot would be totally changed. Through his soliloquies, Shakespeare showed how plays could explore a character's inner motivations and conflict (up until Shakespeare, soliloquies were often used by playwrights to \"introduce [characters], convey information, provide an exposition or reveal plans\").\n\nQuestion: what did shakespeare become famous for?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the Jewish–Roman wars of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter. When sacrifices were offered in ancient times, they were offered as a fulfillment of Biblical commandments. Since there is no longer a Temple, modern religious Jews instead pray or give tzedakah instead to atone for their sins as the korban would have accomplished. According to Orthodox Judaism, the coming of the messiah will not remove the requirement to keep the 613 commandments, and when the Temple is rebuilt, sacrifices will be offered again. Marcus Borg notes that animal sacrifice in Second Temple Judaism was not a \"payment for sin,\" but \n\n Full-scale, open revolt against the Romans occurred with the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 CE. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the Early Christians and the Pharisees survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\".

Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes. Ancient Egyptian was a synthetic language, but it became more analytic later on. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. The Egyptian hieroglyphs had been well known to scholars of the ancient world for centuries, but few had made any attempts to understand them. By the mid-1st millennium BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic were still used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more cursive script was used for informal, day-to-day writing: Demotic. The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the Coptic alphabet, a revised version of the Greek alphabet. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when Christianity became the state religion throughout the Roman Empire; hieroglyphs were discarded as idolatrous images of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the Biblical canon. Egyptian hieroglyphs were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt, used for writing the Egyptian language. The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet. Through the Phoenician alphabet's major child systems (the Greek and Aramaic scripts), the Egyptian hieroglyphic script is ancestral to the majority of scripts in modern use, most prominently the Latin and Cyrillic scripts (through Greek) and the Arabic script and possibly Brahmic family of scripts (through Aramaic). Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.\n\nQuestion: what was the ancient egyptians spoken language?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

A Republican, Vitter served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1992 to 1999. He then represented Louisiana's 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1999 to 2005. Vitter was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. He was the first Republican to represent Louisiana in the Senate since the Reconstruction Era, and the first ever Republican to be popularly elected. In 2010, Vitter won a second Senate term by defeating Democratic U.S. Representative Charlie Melançon. Vitter unsuccessfully ran for governor to succeed the term-limited Bobby Jindal in the 2015 gubernatorial election. He lost the general election to Democrat John Bel Edwards. Whilst conceding defeat to Edwards, Vitter announced that he would not seek reelection to his Senate seat in 2016 and would retire from office at the completion of his term. One-term Republican John Kennedy was elected in 2016 with 60.6% of the vote and has announced his intention to run for a second term. Kennedy's re-election bid was defeated by Thomas Blount in 1810, though Kennedy was subsequently elected in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by Blount's death. Hebert served from 1991 to 1995 on the Iberia Parish Council, equivalent to county commission in most other states, before being elected for three terms as a Democrat to the Louisiana House. In 2007, Hebert was term limited in the state House from District 49 (Iberia and Vermilion parishes). He won the general election over Republican Jeff Landry, 52-48 percent. In 2010, Landry was elected to the United States House of Representatives to succeed candidate Charlie Melancon, who lost the U.S. Senate race to David Vitter.

Being the world's second largest aid donor, China uses economic policies to intervene internationally, providing developmental aid to over 100 countries, especially to nations sanctioned by Western governments. Both the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank lend more in volume to developing nations than all G7 nations combined and more than the World Bank. As China has grown, it has positioned itself to change international networks instead of remaining neutral and to protect its interests abroad, especially in a post-Cold War era. Chinese scholars have increasingly advocated for interventionist policies to protect Chinese interests in a globalized international community. To further rebalance power in the IMF, China appealed for changes that would transfer voting power to developing economies. China cooperated with other developing countries to advance its rebalancing project. China cooperated with the BRICS, a coalition of the nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Johnson was the third overall pick in the 1977 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks. He played seven seasons with Milwaukee before finishing his NBA career with the Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors. In the final game of the tournament, Larry Bird and his erstwhile unbeaten Indiana State Sycamores lost to Magic Johnson and his Michigan State Spartans by the score of 75–64. After the tournament, both entered the NBA in the 1979–80 season with high expectations. Bird, who was selected 6th in the 1978 NBA draft but committed back to Indiana State for his senior season, was named Rookie of the Year after leading the Celtics to a 32-game turnaround from the previous year, going from 29 to 61 wins. The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Celtics in the conference finals before losing to the Lakers in the 1980 NBA Finals, with Johnson earning Finals MVP honors for his Game 6 performance. He went on to win five more NBA championships in the 1980s with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he teamed up with Magic Johnson, the first pick in 1979.

These philosophers would come to have a deep influence on the politics and ideologies of France and America. Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu (1689–1755) was a social commentator and political philosopher. His theories deeply influenced the American Founders. James Madison proposed this governmental scheme so that the power and influence of each branch would be balanced by those of the others. These ideas originated in the work of French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu who described these concepts in his book The Spirit of the Laws (1748). Here Montesquieu explained how these checks on powers were efficient in preventing tyranny. Étienne-Gabriel Morelly (1717–1778) was a French utopian thinker and novelist. An otherwise \"obscure tax official\", Morelly wrote two books on education and a critique of Montesquieu. Locke's ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking of English writers such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon, and Benjamin Hoadly, whose political ideas in turn also had a strong influence on the American Patriots. The Americans heavily relied on Montesquieu's analysis of the wisdom of the \"balanced\" British Constitution (mixed government) in writing the state and national constitutions. Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu (18 January 1689 – 10 February 1755), generally referred to as simply Montesquieu, was a French judge, man of letters, historian, and political philosopher.\n\nQuestion: what did baron de montesquie influence?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid, although descriptions vary depending on location. One of the most famous accounts of Bigfoot is the Patterson-Gimlin film where a supposedly female Bigfoot marches across the screen with giant strides, turns to face the camera, then marches off up a steep hill and into the forest. There are more than 100 \n\n The skunk ape, also known as the swamp ape and Florida Bigfoot, is a purported ape-like creature that is said to inhabit the forests and swamps of some southeastern United States, most notably in Florida. Like Bigfoot, a prominent subject within American folklore, supposed evidence of the existence of the skunk ape is based on a number of anecdotal sightings as well as disputed photographs, audio and video recordings, and footprints. Chuck Coull, the first person to have his encounter with the Mugwump documented and published, claimed the animal looked like a person-sized sturgeon. Jack Dent claimed in 1979 that a descendant of Chief Wabi (aka \"Big Wabi\") had informed him of the creature which lived in the lake. Folklorists trace the phenomenon of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources including the cultures of indigenous people across the continent, the European wild man figure, and folk tales among loggers, miners, trappers, and prospectors. Other creatures of relatively similar descriptions are alleged to inhabit various regions throughout the world, such as the Skunk ape of the southeastern United States; the Almas, Yeren, and Yeti in Asia; and the Australian Yowie; all of which, like Bigfoot, are engrained in the cultures of their regions.\n\nQuestion: what do australians call bigfoot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The boundary is, however, broken by the Timor Gap, where Australian and East Timorese territorial waters meet and where the two countries have overlapping claims to the seabed. Australia and Indonesia also share a common maritime border in the Indian Ocean between Australia's overseas territory of Christmas Island and the Indonesian island of Java. It has an area of 420,540 km2, which equates to approximately 22% of Indonesia's land area. The main issue of refugees is from conflict between Indonesian national security forces, and various groups of disaffected groups in West Papua seeking refuge in the Papua New Guinea territory. The subsequent diplomatic issues that have arisen, usually is the refugee flows and border transgressions by Indonesian forces. Its (PNG) proximity and cultural ties to the Indonesian province of Papua means there is potential for a mass influx of West Papuan refugees. Borneo and the other Indonesian islands west of Sulawesi are part of Sundaland, and were connected to the Asian continent when sea levels were lower during the ice ages.

An architect by training, Speer joined the Nazi Party in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler commissioned him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg. Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge domed assembly hall over 700 ft high, with floor space for 180,000 people. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the Prachtstrasse. Plans to build a \n\n  On 30 January 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the Prachtstrasse, or Street of Magnificence; he also referred to it as the \"North–South Axis\". No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the 4 entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the Victory Column or Siegessäule, and the Schwerbelastungskörper, a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941.

These powers include the authority to govern international affairs, interstate commerce, the currency and national defense. McCulloch v. Maryland was seminal case handed down by the Supreme Court in 1819 which prevented State legislatures from taxing federal institutions. of state policy. The constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative and executive powers between the Federation and the States. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government, the absence of dual citizenship, and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency. The Constitution assigns the powers of the federal government to the legislative (Article I), executive (Article II), and judicial (Article III) branches, and the Tenth Amendment provides that those powers not expressly delegated to the federal government are reserved by the States or the people. From early in the Constitutional Convention, Madison held the position that the national government should be federal because if it were more extensive in relation to the states, that would increase the \"probability of duration, happiness and good order\". It was not initially clear how the new government would interact with the states, and Madison was in favor of a federal form, \"a political system in which at least two territorial levels of government share sovereign constitutional authority over their respective division and joint share of law-making powers; differently put, neither the federal government nor the relevant federative entities may unilaterally alter one another's powers without a process of constitutional amendment in which both levels of government participate.\" As a political movement, many constitutionalists have expressed concern over provisions of the 2001 USA Patriot Act, civil asset forfeiture laws, mass surveillance, police checkpoints and militarization of police, while differing over other issues, such as restrictions on firearms,  states' rights to determine drug and restroom laws, and federal management of public lands.\n\nQuestion: what type of government does the us constitution set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the ensuing 30+ year period over 3,500 deaths were attributed to these hostilities which came to be known as The Troubles. and the vast majority of their victims were random Catholic civilians. During the Troubles there were incidents where some local British soldiers and police colluded with loyalist paramilitaries, such as the attacks by the Glenanne group. Signed in 1973, the Sunningdale Agreement sought to end the conflict by establishing power-sharing government between unionists and Irish nationalists, and ensuring greater co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. In protest, loyalists organized the Ulster Workers' Council strike in May 1974. It was enforced by loyalist paramilitaries and brought large parts of Northern Ireland to a standstill. It was sparked by official permission for an Orange Order march in Portadown, and the RUC's aggressive removal of nationalist protesters who had been blocking the march (the Drumcree conflict).

On 2 June 1927, Pope Pius XI decreed that the Comma Johanneum of the New Testament was open to dispute; on 3 September 1943, Pope Pius XII reiterated the teaching of the Church in Divino afflante Spiritu, reaffirming that Catholic translations of the Bible in vernacular languages, based on Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew texts, had been allowed by the Church since the time of the Council of Trent. Newer Catholic translations of the Bible have been based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages, taking into account as well the ancient translations that sometimes clarify what seem to be transcription errors in those manuscripts. However, the Latin Vulgate remains the official Bible in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. the 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 825.1, the NRSV with the deuterocanonical books received the Imprimatur of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, meaning that the NRSV (Catholic Edition) is officially approved by the Catholic Church and can be profitably used by Catholics in private study and devotional reading.

Dubbed the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. Ultimately, four volumes devoted to Presley were released over the next decade in RCA's A Legendary Performer series, the only RCA Victor recording artist other than Glenn Miller to have multiple volumes issued in that series. The series is also notable for the first release of several previously unissued  recordings by Presley, with  each successive volume containing  increasing amounts of  unreleased material. It features liner notes by Roy Carr of the New Musical Express. Elvis began his singing career with Sun Records label in Memphis. From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee is the twenty-third studio album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released by RCA Records in May, 1976.

In traditional classifications, Hellenic consists of Greek alone, but some linguists group Greek together with various ancient languages thought to have been closely related or distinguish varieties of Greek that are distinct enough to be considered separate languages. In the late Neolithic, speakers of this dialect, which would become Proto-Greek, migrated from their homeland northeast of the Black Sea to the Balkans and into the Greek peninsula. of the population declared Albanian as their mother tongue (mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood). In recent years, the shrinking number of pupils in schools dedicated to the Greek minority has caused problems for teachers. The Greek language is spoken by an important percentage in the southern part of the country, due to cultural and economic links with adjacent Greece. In a 2017 study carried out by Instat, the Albanian government statistical agency, 39.9% of the 25–64 years old is able to use at least one foreign language, with English first at 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. Italian and French have had a stable interest, while Greek has lost much of its previous interest. Greek is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first language, and with two-thirds of mainly Albanian families having at least one member that speaks Greek, most having learned it in the post communist era (1992–present) due to private schools or migration to Greece.

His work was influential on the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he is well known for his relationship with Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.

Typical events during such volcanic episodes include pyroclastic flows, super-heated gas clouds rapidly descending the volcano's east flank, conceivably reaching as far as Boquete, Alto Boquete, and the Caldera River, and fallout of ash and other particles ranging in size from dust to 1-meter blocks, known as tephra, causing fires, roof collapses, water \n\nLassen Peak and Mount Shasta (California) ; Crater Lake (Mazama), Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood (Oregon) ; Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Glacier Peak, Mount Baker (Washington) ; Mount Garibaldi and Mount Meager massif (British Columbia)  The Cascade Volcanic Arc is a continental volcanic arc that extends from northern California to the coastal peninsula of Alaska.

However, because the graphemes in Chinese's logographic writing system are not directly linked to pronunciation (though there are quasi-phonetic hints), Cantonese speakers who do not speak Mandarin will read aloud the characters in Cantonese pronunciation only. Here is an example:  In the above example, note the switching of the direct and indirect objects and the use of different vocabulary for certain words in the standard Chinese and colloquial Cantonese renditions. The standard written language served as a bridge for communication throughout China and other Sinophone countries and Chinese influenced countries like Japan, the Ryukyus, Korea, and Vietnam for millennia. The gulf became so wide between the formal written and colloquial spoken languages that it was blamed for hindering education and literacy, and some even went so far as to blame it in part for the political turmoil that occurred in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. This eventually culminated in the adoption of written vernacular Chinese, which was based on modern spoken Mandarin, for all formal communication. Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, Chinese characters have developed from logograms that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible. Note: Mandarin romanized using Hanyu Pinyin. However, standard Chinese and its pronunciation in local Chinese language varieties is still a formal register in regions where Mandarin is not spoken natively, such as most of South China.

McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, who was armed with a .32 caliber revolver that was concealed underneath a handkerchief. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley's jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach. Although McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, his condition rapidly declined due to gangrene setting in around his wounds and he died on September 14, 1901, at 2:15 a.m. Members \n\n Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting Tahawus in 1901 during the final days of President William McKinley's presidency. Roosevelt had been vacationing in Vermont, but quickly left for Buffalo, New York after learning that President William McKinley had recently been shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Mrs. McKinley traveled to California with the President in May 1901, but became so ill in San Francisco that the planned tour of the Northwest was cancelled. On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was shot in the stomach by a 28-year-old anarchist named Leon Czolgosz. McKinley served from November 27, 1826 to March 3, 1831. Formally nominated on September 18, 1837, McKinley was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 25, 1837, and received his commission the same day. McKinley served on the Supreme Court for fourteen years. In 1901, while attending the Pan-American Exposition, President William McKinley was shot twice at close range by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Although early doctor's reports on the President's condition were positive, McKinley's condition soon worsened: while Vice President Theodore Roosevelt rushed back to Buffalo, he was informed on arrival that McKinley had died.

Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states. The 2024 Indiana gubernatorial election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the Governor of Indiana, concurrently with the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as well as elections to the United States Senate and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections.

Not only Debussy's use of whole-tone scales, but also his style of word-setting in Pelléas et Mélisande, were the subject of study by Leoš Janáček while he was writing his 1921 opera Káťa Kabanová. Stravinsky was more ambivalent about Debussy's music (he thought Pelléas \"a terrible bore ... in spite of many wonderful pages\") but the two composers knew each \n\n It was Richard Wagner's music that inspired Dallapiccola to start composing in earnest, and Claude Debussy's that caused him to stop: hearing Der fliegende Holländer while exiled to Austria convinced the young man that composition was his calling, but after first hearing Debussy in 1921, at age 17, he stopped composing for three years in order to give this important influence time to sink in.

Like Beethoven, Debussy finished only one opera, but his setting of Maeterlinck's Symbolist play Pelléas et Mélisande is a key work in 20th century music drama. In many ways an \"anti-opera\", Pelléas contained little of the conventional singing or action audiences at the première had come to expect, but Debussy used his subtle orchestration to create an elusive, dream-like atmosphere, which still has the power to fascinate (or repel) listeners today.\n\nQuestion: what type of music did claude debussy play?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was fascinated by the Code of Hammurabi and pursued the subject avidly, even after leaving Iraq. Between 1952 and 1955, he wrote a series of six detailed articles in Urdu on Hammurabi, his laws, Babylonian civilisation, traditions, customs and language. The six articles were subsequently revised, expanded and published as a book and in 2000, a new edition was published in Lahore entitled \"Hammurabi aur Babli Tahzib va Tamaddum\". Malik Ram maintained that Hammurabi is one of the all-time great figures in world history, who should be given more attention, time and space in the modern world, in educational institutions and by the media. The Code of Hammurabi, promulgated about 1772 BC by the Babylonian king Hammurabi specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man. Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi, king Siwe-Palar-huhpak of Elam made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement, among other terrible fates.

While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman's movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views. In Scotland, Reid published her influential A Plea for Woman in 1843, which proposed a transatlantic Western agenda for women's rights, including voting rights for women. Caroline Norton advocated for changes in British law.

The French Revolution accelerated this, with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the 1789 march on Versailles.

The yuan is the basic unit of the renminbi, but the word is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. The idea of fiat currency was established just over a thousand years ago in China during the Yuan, Tang, Song and Ming dynasties. During the Song Dynasty (960-1276), there was a booming business in the Sichan region that led to a shortage of copper money. It is also used as a synonym of that currency, especially in international contexts – the ISO 4217 standard code for renminbi is CNY, an abbreviation of \"Chinese yuan\". When used in English in the context of the modern foreign exchange market, the Chinese yuan (CNY) refers to the renminbi (RMB), which is the official currency used in mainland China. However, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China has been concerned that the Chinese financial system would not be able to handle the potential rapid cross-border movements of hot money, and as a result, as of 2012, the currency trades within a narrow band specified by the Chinese central government. Following the internationalization of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF voted to designate the renminbi as one of several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special drawing rights. The RMB became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's SDR basket on 1 October 2016.

The Colts relocated from Baltimore in 1984, and began their stay in Indianapolis winning 90 of 228 games through the 1997 season, including 5 playoff games. Since Jim Irsay assumed control of the franchise in 1998 after the death of his father Robert Irsay, the team has become the first in league history to win 12 games or more in five \n\n The 2009 Indianapolis Colts season was the franchise's 57th season in the National Football League and the 26th in Indianapolis. It was the first season since 2001 that the Colts did not have Tony Dungy on their coaching staff, due to his retirement from coaching. The Colts also clinched the top seed in the AFC. The Colts were aiming to end their three-year Super Bowl drought. During the playoffs, the Colts defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship game and represented the AFC in Super Bowl XLIV. The 14–2 Colts lost to the 13–3 New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV, 31–17. Before that game, the Colts had notified the league that the Patriots were allegedly under inflating the footballs (Deflategate), allegedly based on a tip from the Baltimore Ravens. Looking to defend their back-to-back division titles and finally advance to the Super Bowl, the Colts finished 8–8 in 2015 and missed the playoffs for the first time under Pagano. Indianapolis never recovered, never put Manning into the game, and lost 29–15, ending the Colts' chance at an undefeated season. Two major league sports teams are based in Indianapolis: the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) and the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Originally the Baltimore Colts, the franchise has been based in Indianapolis since relocating in 1984. The Colts' tenure in Indianapolis has produced 11 division championships, two conference championships, and two Super Bowl appearances.\n\nQuestion: what league are the indianapolis colts in?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To navigate back to Spain and avoid seizure by the Portuguese, the expedition's two remaining ships split, one \n\n Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano during the circumnavigation of the world. The expedition's cartographer and translator, Antonio Pigafetta, left this description of the place: \"On Tuesday, September 20, in the same year [1519] we departed from the place called Sanlúcar [de Barrameda], heading southwest, and before the end of the month, on the 26th, we arrived at an island that is called Tenerife, at 28 degrees longitude, to acquire meat, water, and firewood. Their goal was to sail through the Strait of Magellan to get to their destiny, which scared many sailors because of the harsh weather conditions. Magellan, definitely saw the island as he passed for the first time in the strait. Antonio Pigafetta, while speaking about the desertion of Sab Antonio cites in his famous book, :s:The First Voyage Round the World/Pigafetta's Account of Magellan's Voyage (Chap.79), that in to alert the crew of the ship if they ever try to get back: ''This manner of acting had been ordained by the captain from the commencement, in order to effect the junction of any ship which might be separated from the others. He joined the expedition to the Spice Islands led by explorer Ferdinand Magellan under the flag of the emperor Charles V and after Magellan's death in the Philippine Islands, the subsequent voyage around the world. During the expedition, he served as Magellan's assistant and kept an accurate journal, which later assisted him in translating the Cebuano language. Pigafetta was one of the 18 men who made the complete trip, returning to Spain in 1522, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, out of the approximately 240 who set out three years earlier.\n\nQuestion: what country did magellan represent?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bosnia faced many challenges during the war, including bombings throughout the country that ruined much of the infrastructure. Parallel regimes took over Bosnia and flipped the country upside down with land mines, bullets, and bombings. The war in Bosnia also consisted of an ethnic \"cleanse\" of Bosnian Muslims initiated by Bosnian Serbs, which included containment of Bosniaks in concentration camps. By November 1992 Serbs had conquered 70% of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and held Sarajevo in limbo by terrorizing its population by shelling and constant sniper fire. Political disputes and minor incidents in central and northern Bosnia and in northern and central Herzegovina led to Croat-Bosniak War in November 1992. This plan increased conflict between Croats and Bosniaks. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) launched four offensives and conquered a large area which was under control of HVO; almost the whole Central Bosnia (except Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovača, Kiseljak, Kreševo and Žepče and the wider areas around those towns \n\n The siege of Mostar was fought during the Bosnian War first in 1992 and then again later in 1993 to 1994. Initially lasting between April 1992 and June 1992, it involved the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) fighting against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) after Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. That phase ended in June 1992 after the success of Operation Jackal, launched by the Croatian Army (HV) and HVO. As the wider conflict matured and the political landscape changed, the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks began to fight against each other, culminating in the Croat–Bosniak War. Between June 1993 and April 1994 the HVO besieged Bosniak-concentrated East Mostar, resulting in the deaths of numerous civilians, a cut off of humanitarian aid, damage or destruction of ten mosques, and the blowing up of the historic Stari Most bridge.\n\nQuestion: what happened in bosnia in the 90s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and in most circumstances is the de facto common language used in government, education, and commerce. American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world. The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century. The primary, although not official, language of the United States is English. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others which were imported by immigrants. English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Some Americans advocate making English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both English and Hawaiian are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French.\n\nQuestion: where english is spoken?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence; this is despite being the oldest wonder by about 2,000 years. It is located on the south side of the Menkaure pyramid in the Giza Necropolis. The Great Pyramid of Giza, largest and oldest of the three pyramids at the Giza Necropolis in Egypt and the only surviving of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was granted honorary status. The Giza Plateau is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the \"Great Pyramid\" and the \"Pyramid of Cheops\"), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren), the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as \"Queen's pyramids\", and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Of the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex.

The Rays, unlike the other teams to close stadiums before them, are staying in Florida; they are relocating their spring training home to the Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, where they spent $20 million to rebuild its main stadium. The site of Progress Energy Park was connected to plans to build a new retractable roof stadium for the Rays to replace the fixed-dome Tropicana Field, but was eventually withdrawn from consideration by team ownership in favor of a more thorough study. Many Major League stars have played in the stadium including Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, Tim Raines, and David Eckstein. One of the signature features of the ballpark is the wavy roof sitting over the seats in the stadium, providing shade for the fans in attendance.

Like Mozart, Beethoven traveled (in 1796) to Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, and Berlin in the company of Prince Lichnowsky. The following century saw two major German composers come to fame early—Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert.

As part of her Little House series of autobiographical novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote a book titled Farmer Boy about Wilder's childhood in upstate New York. Wilder is a well-known character in the Little House books where his wife wrote about their courtship and subsequent marriage in The Long Winter, Little Town on the Prairie, These Happy Golden Years, and The First Four Years. Pepin, Wisconsin, is the birthplace of author Laura Ingalls Wilder. Nellie Oleson appeared in three of the Little House novels Ingalls Wilder: On the Banks of Plum Creek (1937), Little Town on the Prairie (1939), and These Happy Golden Years (1943) — the fourth, seventh, and eighth in the series. In that novel Laura is 7 to 9 years old. Oleson also stars in Nellie Oleson Meets Laura Ingalls, a book by Tui T. Sutherland (as Heather Williams), published by HarperCollins in 2007. The Library of Congress catalog summary is \"Wealthy, spoiled Nellie Oleson is only happy when she is the center of attention, and so she feels angry and left out when Laura Ingalls, a poor country girl, moves to Walnut Grove and is embraced by Nellie's friends and schoolteacher.\" Mansfield, Missouri, is the chosen final home town of Laura Ingalls Wilder.

Italy is a parliamentary republic: the President of the Republic is elected for a seven-year term by the two houses of Parliament in joint session, together with special electors appointed by the Regional Councils. During its history, Italy has had many political parties, both national and regional, with different party systems. The most recent Italian general election was held on 4 March 2018. Greece is a parliamentary representative democratic republic, where the President of Greece is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Greece is the head of government within a multi-party system. Between the restoration of democracy in 1974 and the Greek government-debt crisis the party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative New Democracy and the social-democratic PASOK. The Greek governmental structure is similar to that found in many other Western democracies, and has been described as a compromise between the French and German models. Voting in Greece is compulsory but is not enforced. The constitution of Italy provides for two kinds of binding referendums. This kind of referendum is valid only if at least a majority of electors goes to the polling station. It is forbidden to call a referendum regarding financial laws or laws relating to pardons or the ratification of international treaties. Any citizen entitled to vote in an election to the Chamber of Deputies may participate in a referendum. Executive power is exercised by the Government of the Czech Republic which reports to the Chamber of Deputies. Czech Parliament is bicameral, the upper house of the Parliament is the Senate, the lower house of the Parliament is the Chamber of Deputies. The Chamber of Deputies consists of 200 members who are elected for four years.\n\nQuestion: what type of government system does italy have?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was raised like all children in his society, away from his parents in collective homes: the Home of Infants from birth until five years old, then the Home of Students from five to fifteen.

Rushdie employs alcohol and inebriation as lenses through which he explores various aspects of colonial life and the impact of British rule. One of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. Alcohol becomes a symbol through which the characters in the novel negotiate their identities and navigate the changing social and political landscapes. By using alcohol as a tool, Rushdie explores the conflicts and tensions that emerge as India transitions from a colonized nation to an independent one. Another way Rushdie uses alcohol is to satirize and undermine the supposed benefits that Empire presented to India and its people. By depicting characters struggling with alcoholism, he challenges the notion that colonial rule brought progress and advancement to the country. Through the lens of alcohol, Rushdie critiques the exploitative nature of Empire and exposes the contradictions inherent in its claims of superiority. Furthermore, Rushdie's exploration of alcohol and alcoholism allows him to delve into the medical legacy of Empire. He highlights the negative health consequences associated with excessive drinking and the toll it takes on individuals and society. By incorporating medical sources related to alcohol and inebriation, Rushdie sheds light on the detrimental effects of both personal and societal reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism or means of escape. Overall, Salman Rushdie's use of alcohol and alcoholism in \"Midnight's Children\" offers a multi-dimensional perspective on the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Through this literary device, Rushdie explores the complexities of identity, satirizes the claims of Empire, and exposes the health consequences associated with excessive drinking. I wrote about the lessons I learned from this journey in a manuscript called “Original Parts: Aging and Reckoning with Cystic Fibrosis Related Kidney Disease”. It’s a good example of how “writing where it hurts” can enrich academic literature as surely as it can expand general knowledge about improving care for people with health challenges.

The author of this post is a transgender person conducting research on higher education in the United States. Here, in Part Three, they share the rest of their informal interviews with these scholars picking up at question 3. How do you hold yourself accountable for gender-expansive praxis? Scholar #1: I try to be honest with myself about … if I’m really asking those questions and pushing on those assumptions consistently. I step back when I think I might be going down a scholarly road that isn’t my place. Scholar #2: I think that holding myself accountable starts with my inner work. I’m the first to acknowledge that I’m a work in progress and don’t always get it right. Yet, I also want them to know that they’ll get things wrong too and that it’s important for us to learn together in community and work to get it right. These are all important practice that come to mind around holding myself accountable. Scholar #1: In my life, I’ve come to understand a few things about social change work. At the risk of sounding pollyannaish, I really believe this. I can’t only, always, ever think about cis women’s oppression, though it is real and ending it is important to me. That can’t be the whole focus of my work, because then, I am only advancing myself and others like me. I think we can all do more to end oppression for groups we don’t belong to, and I think we must, lest we become so deeply invested in our own identities and their shifting power terms that we lose sight of everything else. Much of this is due to white supremacy and genderism. The intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and other identities becomes a moral imperative that should move humanity to take action. I think that’s a problem. Yet, I am aware that often they do. Gender-expansive praxis has the ability to correct that though, and that’s the work that I am committed to doing. Scholar #1: The simple answer is because it’s the right thing to do. That’s my cause, and as long as I have breath, I’m sticking to it! Gender-expansive work says that we don’t have to be restricted by boxes and labels unnecessarily if we don’t want. It opens up new possibilities, and what’s wrong with that? And there are choices to be made with that privilege. \"Cunning [and] sly ... This babbling Andrew is a casualty of his times, binding his wounds with thick wrappings of words, ideas, bits of story, whatever his spinning mind can unspool for him. One of the things that makes [Andrew] such a terrific comic creation is that he's both maddeningly self-delusive and scarily self-aware: He's a fool, but he's no innocent.\" \"The whole story comes to us as the rambling testimony of a depressed scientist being patiently interviewed, possibly by a government psychiatrist. Andrew flits around the events that led him here — wherever here is: Early in the book he says, \"I don't know what I'm doing here,\" which makes two of us. He sometimes speaks of himself in the third person; he regularly mocks his unnamed interrogator; and he pays no attention to chronology. It's our job to put the tragic incidents of his life in order, to unscramble the taunting clues, to unearth the profundities buried in this misanthropic rumination. \"Andrew's Brain\" hurt mine. The problem isn't that the novel requires a significant degree of intellectual effort; it's that it doesn't provide sufficient reward for that effort.\" Speak No Evil is a 2018 novel by Nigerian American writer Uzodinma Iweala. In his second novel, Iweala explores the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, nationality and the diaspora through the story of Niru, a Nigerian-American high-school senior living in a middle-class suburb of Washington, D.C., who comes out as gay to his white straight friend Meredith. The first two thirds of the book are narrated by Niru while the last third is narrated by Meredith. Niru is forced to confront the many ways in which he is privileged, as well as disenfranchised. Iweala also interweaves themes of religion, cultural dislocation, mental health, police brutality, and more, all of which further add to and further complicate Niru's life and identities.\n\nQuestion: what did john irving wrote?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Touchardia latifolia, commonly known as olonā in Hawaiian, is a species of flowering shrub in the nettle family, Urticaceae. T. latifolia is endemic to Hawaii and inhabits mesic valleys and wet forests at elevations of 70 - 1200 m. Typical to many Hawaiian plants, the olonā does not have the stinging hairs of its mainland cousins. It is found on all the main Hawaiian islands except Kahoolawe and Niihau. Olonā has alternate leaves whose shape greatly varies depending upon the environment from thin lancolate to broad elliptic. Olonā typically flowers between the months of May through December The female flowers are borne on branching cymes which become fleshy orange berry-like achenes, and the male flowers are white. Here is the list of flowering plants used in herbalism or in herbal medicine to treat human diseases. Hibiscus are ornamental plants and hibiscus flowers are used to make herbal tea around the world.

Andruw Rudolf Jones (born April 23, 1977) is a Curaçaoan former baseball outfielder and designated hitter who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), most notably for the Atlanta Braves. Jones also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Jones was a noted defensive specialist for most of his career and won the Rawlings Gold Glove Award for outfielders every year from 1998 through 2007. He was an MLB All-Star five times, and he won both the Hank Aaron Award and a Silver Slugger Award for outfielders in 2005. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman Chipper Jones would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder Michael Bourn, along with shortstops Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. On June 28, 2013, the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman Chipper Jones' jersey, number 10, before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Upon taking office, Jimmy Carter reoriented U.S. foreign policy towards a new emphasis on human rights, democratic values, nuclear non-proliferation, and global poverty. In an effort to end the Arab–Israeli conflict, he helped arrange the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. Carter's policy was to denounce and try to end the apartheid policies in South Africa and Angola, whereby small white minorities had full control of government. Under the new conservative administration a more conciliatory approach was taken by the Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker. He rejected \n\n Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the election of 1976, but his foreign-policy became mired in endless difficulties, including a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and a confrontation with the new anti-American regime in Iran. Carter had very little foreign policy experience, and he was unable to stop the bitter infighting between his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, on the dovish side, versus national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Carter initially wanted to nominate George Ball as Secretary of State, but he was vetoed by Brzezinski as too dovish. With international energy's future uncertain for America, Carter acted quickly to have the department come into action the first year of his presidency. This was an extremely important issue of the time as the oil crisis was causing shortages and inflation.\n\nQuestion: what did president carter do in office?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The casualties suffered by the Western Allies in making this contribution to the defeat of the Wehrmacht were relatively light, 164,590–195,576 killed/missing, 537,590 wounded, and 78,680 taken prisoner, a total loss of 780,860 to 811,846 to inflict a loss of 2.8 million prisoners on the German army. Britain remained alone but refused to negotiate, and defeated Germany's air attacks in the Battle of Britain. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941.

The National People's Congress in 2018 altered the country's constitution to remove the two-term limit on holding the Presidency of China, permitting the current leader, Xi Jinping, to remain president of China (and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party) for an unlimited time, earning criticism for creating dictatorial governance. The incumbent premier is Li Keqiang, \n\n the People's Congress of the level immediately below. China supports the Leninist principle of \"democratic centralism\", but critics describe the elected National People's Congress as a \"rubber stamp\" body. In official discourse, each group of leadership is identified with a distinct extension of the ideology of the party. Historians have studied various periods in the development of the government of the People's Republic of China by reference to these \"generations\". On 1 October 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the establishment of the PRC before a massive crowd at Tiananmen Square. Consultation takes place under the leadership of the CCP, with mass organizations, the United Front parties, and \"representatives from all walks of life\". This process is institutionalized in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Since 2018, the main body of the Chinese constitution declares that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\" The 2018 amendments constitutionalized the de facto one-party state status of China, wherein the CCP General Secretary (party leader) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the informal Paramount leader.

The first municipal airport in New York City was Floyd Bennett Field, developed to lure business away from Newark, but it was ultimately unsuccessful as a general aviation airport and closed in 1941. The New York City Police Department leases facilities for their helicopter operations from the NPS there. It opened in 1927 and was the busiest airport in New York for a time. A decade later it was overshadowed by the larger LaGuardia Airport located nearby. Now the area is wetlands owned by the New York City Economic Development Corporation. John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is the major entry point for international arrivals in the United States, and it is the largest international air freight gateway in the nation by value of shipments. About 100 airlines from more than 50 countries operate flights to JFK. The airport is located along Jamaica Bay near Howard Beach, Queens. The New York metropolitan area has the busiest airport system in the United States and the second busiest in the world after London. The metro area is served by three major airports, John F.

Cuba is attempting to gradually phase out the Cuban convertible peso, unifying the two in the Cuban peso. Panama uses the United States dollar informally, but additionally uses the Panamanian balboa as legal tender. In May 1975, the Republic of Panama proposed to the Central Bank Governors of Latin America for export finance, it was approved in 1976, organized in 1977, incoporporated in 1978, and opened for business on January 2, 1979. Named after the hero of Latin American independence Simón Bolívar, it was introduced following the monetary reform in 1879, before which the venezolano was circulating. Ecuador uses the United States dollar (the French overseas department French Guiana uses the euro, the currency of France).

The \n\n Of the rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean, the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the Zambezi, whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. Its water is used for irrigation and for hydroelectric powe r. It is the largest tributary of the Zambezi, and of Zambia's principal rivers, it is the most central and the most urban. The river discharges 10 km³ per year into the Zambezi River. The Zambezi Region is situated is a tropical area, with high temperatures and much rainfall during the December-to-March rainy season, making it the wettest region of Namibia. In addition to the Zambezi River, the strip also holds the Kwando River, which marks the border with Botswana. Tributaries of the river here go by different names, including the Linyanti and the Chobe. The province's far east is where the Kwando meets the Zambezi.

UN peacekeeping supports global and national security at a fraction of what it would cost to send in U.S. personnel – eight times more economical according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). They draw upon the economic and human resources of UN Member States, allowing the U.S. to share the burden of protecting global peace and security and reducing the need for the U.S. to send their own military troops to volatile regions. The Better World Campaign helps promote greater U.S. assistance to UN peacekeeping operations in order to strengthen each mission's capabilities in logistics, training, doctrine, and management expertise. United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions involving Pakistan cover about 70 operations throughout different parts of the world. Pakistan joined the United Nations on 30 September 1947, despite opposition from Afghanistan because of the Durand Line issue. The Pakistan Armed Forces are the third largest contributor of troops towards UN peacekeeping efforts, behind India and Ethiopia. Peacekeeping, as defined by the United Nations, is the practice of helping countries torn by conflict create conditions for sustainable peace. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Pakistan's contributions have consisted mainly of regular military personnel, but also include paramilitary troops and civilian police officers as peacekeepers. All operations must include the resolution of conflicts through the use of force to be considered valid under the charter of the United Nations. The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948. The WHO incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the , including the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The WHO's mandate seeks and includes: working worldwide to promote health, keeping the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, and collects data on global health issues. The WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most notably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the development of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, COVID-19, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food security; occupational health; and substance abuse. The director-general is Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia. Among the largest contributors were Germany (which contributed 12.18% of the budget), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (11.65%), and the United States (7.85%). The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. Seven of these international conferences, spanning 41 years, were convened before any resulted in a multi-state international agreement. The seventh conference, in Venice in 1892, finally resulted in a convention. Five years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was signed by sixteen of the 19 states attending the Venice conference. While Denmark, Sweden-Norway, and the USA did not sign this convention, it was unanimously agreed that the work of the prior conferences should be codified for implementation. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in 1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of responses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. In part as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau (1902), and the  (1907) were soon founded. When the League of Nations was formed in 1920, they established the Health Organization of the League of Nations. Establishment\nDuring the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, Szeming Sze, a delegate from China, conferred with Norwegian and Brazilian delegates on creating an international health organization under the auspices of the new United Nations. After failing to get a resolution passed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference, recommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. The constitution of the World Health Organization was signed by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries, on 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialized agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state. Andrija Štampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of WHO, having served as executive secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. They believe WHO must regain what they see as independence. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of eradication.) WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also helped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. 1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, it was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive effort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. Two years later preventing discrimination against sufferers was attended to and in 1996 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed. The ICCDE recommends to WHO which countries fulfill requirements for certification. 1998: WHO's Director-General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. 2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. 2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO from just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to health emergencies. The WHO fulfills this objective through its functions as defined in its Constitution:\n(a) To act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work;\n(b) To establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;\n(c) To assist Governments, upon request, in strengthening health services;\n(d) To furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;(e) To provide or assist in providing, upon the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the peoples of trust territories; (f) To establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical services;(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases; (h) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the prevention of accidental injuries;\n(i) To promote, in co-operation with other specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, recreation, economic or working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene; (j) To promote co-operation among scientific and professional groups which contribute to the advancement of health; (k) To propose conventions, agreements and regulations, and make recommendations with respect to international health matters and to perform. , the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS network and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%. At the time, the World Health Assembly President, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's opposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and \"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease. During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to malaria control. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and effect of tuberculosis, and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from deadly disease. This response was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken during the last decade\". Through the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), it can recommend changes to scheduling of substances to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The WHO works to improve nutrition, food safety and food security and to ensure this has a positive effect on public health and sustainable development. The situation in West Africa was considered very serious. Reform efforts following the Ebola outbreak\nFollowing the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the organization was heavily criticized for its bureaucracy, insufficient financing, regional structure, and staffing profile. An internal WHO report on the Ebola response pointed to underfunding and the lack of \"core capacity\" in health systems in developing countries as the primary weaknesses of the existing system. At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. However, Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, canceled the planned withdrawal and announced in January 2021 that the U.S. would resume funding the organization. Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981), Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003) the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010) as well as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and its pediatric counterpart. An international convention on pandemic prevention and preparedness is being actively considered. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". The World Health Assembly is attended by delegations from all member states, and determines the policies of the organization. In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly, they are seated alongside the other NGOs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. It appoints the director-general every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. Director-General\n\nThe head of the organization is the director-general, elected by the World Health Assembly. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003. On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Country and liaison offices\nThe World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. Financing and partnerships\n\nPresent \nThe WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2020, the biggest contributor is the United States, which gives over $400 million annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. , the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million). According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa. The WHO Constitution states its main objective as \"the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health\". The WHO was established on 7 April 1948.

At the annual World Health Assembly in 2015, Director-General Margaret Chan announced a $100 million Contingency Fund for rapid response to future emergencies, of which it had received $26.9 million by April 2016 (for 2017 disbursement). WHO has budgeted an additional $494 million for its Health Emergencies Programme in 2016–17, for which it had received $140 million by April 2016. The program was aimed at rebuilding WHO capacity for direct action, which critics said had been lost due to budget cuts in the previous decade that had left the organization in an advisory role dependent on member states for on-the-ground activities. While organizing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and overseeing \"more than 35 emergency operations\" for cholera, measles and other epidemics internationally, the WHO has been criticized for praising China's public health response to the crisis while seeking to maintain a \"diplomatic balancing act\" between the United States and China. The WHO faced criticism from the United States' Trump administration while \"guid[ing] the world in how to tackle the deadly\" COVID-19 pandemic. On 14 April 2020, United States President Donald Trump said that he would halt United States funding to the WHO while reviewing its role in \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" World leaders and health experts largely condemned President Trump's announcement, which came amid criticism of his response to the outbreak in the United States. On 8 May 2020, the United States blocked a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at promoting nonviolent international cooperation during the pandemic, and mentioning the WHO. On 7 July 2020, President Trump formally notified the UN of his intent to withdraw the United States from the WHO. However, Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, canceled the planned withdrawal and announced in January 2021 that the U.S. would resume funding the organization. Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981), Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003) the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010) as well as the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and its pediatric counterpart. An international convention on pandemic prevention and preparedness is being actively considered. WHO collaborates with The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to spearhead and fund the development of HIV programs. As part of the United Nations, the World Health Organization supports work towards the Millennium Development Goals. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals, three – reducing child mortality by two-thirds, to reduce maternal deaths by three-quarters, and to halt and begin to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS – relate directly to WHO's scope; the other five inter-relate and affect world health. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to set priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and evaluate it. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the first region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in September 2009. The database was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights initiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with mental health conditions. It also contains important international documents and information. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To make achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that countries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health coverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and efforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include addressing gender inequity where females are nearly twice as likely as men to get infected with HIV and tailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be compromised due to natural disasters, etc. Membership\n\n, the WHO has 194 member states: all member states of the United Nations except for Liechtenstein (192 countries), plus the Cook Islands and Niue. A state becomes a full member of WHO by ratifying the treaty known as the Constitution of the World Health Organization. and January 2021, it also had two associate members, Puerto Rico and Tokelau. Several other countries have been granted observer status. Palestine is an observer as a \"national liberation movement\" recognized by the League of Arab States under United Nations Resolution 3118. The government of Taiwan was allowed to participate under the designation \"Chinese Taipei\" as an observer from 2009 to 2016, but has not been invited again since. WHO member states appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, the WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN member states are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO website, \"other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly\". The World Health Assembly is attended by delegations from all member states, and determines the policies of the organization. In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into \"official relations\" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly, they are seated alongside the other NGOs. In May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". Its participation with WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election in 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back into power. Political pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from membership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to 2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual assembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple occasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the assembly. In May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media, reportedly due to demands from the PRC. The United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's inclusion in WHO. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO observer, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation. In a 2020 interview, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward appeared to dodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the pandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. He responded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally ended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's political influence over the international organization. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media conference. On 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House Committee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Senator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member, submitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health Organization. It appoints the director-general every five years and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. Director-General\n\nThe head of the organization is the director-general, elected by the World Health Assembly. The current director-general is Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed on 1 July 2017. For example, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. Each regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. The organization has previously instigated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003. On 21 October 2017, the Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus appointed the then Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe as a WHO Goodwill Ambassador to help promote the fight against non-communicable diseases. The appointment attracted widespread condemnation and criticism in WHO member states and international organizations due to Robert Mugabe's poor record on human rights and presiding over a decline in Zimbabwe's public health. Country and liaison offices\nThe World Health Organization operates 150 country offices in six different regions. It also operates several liaison offices, including those with the European Union, United Nations and a single office covering the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally accompanied by satellite-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of the country in question. The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR). , the only WHO Representative outside Europe to be a national of that country was for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (\"Libya\"); all other staff was international. WHO Representatives in the Region termed the Americas are referred to as PAHO/WHO Representatives. In Europe, WHO Representatives also serve as head of the country office, and are nationals except for Serbia; there are also heads of the country office in Albania, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff. The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country's government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies. Financing and partnerships\n\nPresent \nThe WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2020, the biggest contributor is the United States, which gives over $400 million annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S. State Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations (CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, supported by a group of members of his party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO. Funds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60–90 days pending an investigation into WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with China. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman. On 16 May, U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration agreed to pay up to what China pays in Assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous funding. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official relations\" – the rest being considered informal in character. , the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million). According to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million a year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health problems, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan, director-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-night hotel room while visiting West Africa. The UN was established in 1945 with the goal of maintaining international peace, developing friendly relations between nations, and promoting better standards of living, including conquering hunger, disease, and illiteracy. There are currently 193 member states in the UN. One of the ways the UN promotes social justice is through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals encompass a wide range of issues, including poverty reduction, quality education, gender equality, climate action, and good health and well-being. The UN also actively engages philanthropies and civil society in global health initiatives. Through partnerships with various charitable and governmental organizations, the UN supports initiatives such as training local surgical teams and establishing specialty surgical hospitals. In summary, the UN promotes social justice and advocates for global health initiatives through its support of the Sustainable Development Goals, engagement of philanthropies and civil society, and partnerships with different organizations. By addressing various aspects of development and working towards improving access to healthcare, the UN strives to create a more equitable and healthier world for all.\n\nQuestion: what countries do the united nations help?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Williams Residence was the home of the architect and Spingarn Medal winner Paul Williams. The house has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument by the city of Los Angeles. Though known as an \"architect to the stars\", working in many exclusive Los Angeles neighborhoods, the African American Williams built his own house in a neighborhood free of racial restrictions. His hilltop house on what is now Bass Hill in Apple Valley had architectural significance and was one of the scenes of the Perry Mason TV episode, \"The Case of the Roving River.\" He also resided in the Los Cerritos neighborhood of Long Beach, California.

They had three children, Dorothy, Katharyn, and Sherman Jr. Louise Whipple died on July 20, 1914, in Brookline, Massachusetts. The 1200 acre estate contained a large trout hatchery, a stream, three ponds, two greenhouses, a dairy farm, a pig farm, tennis courts, a carpentry shop, a blacksmith's shop, a grist mill, a twelve-room manager's house, twelve cottages, and a hall with a stage, library, and engine house. Much of the land of the estate including the main house from 1961 was acquired by M. Anthony Fisher for $1.3 million in 1991. After the death of Fisher and his wife due to an airplane accident, the place was bought by William Van Devender for $20.35 million in 2005.

Other minor airports near the city are El Palomar Airport, which is located 18 km west of the city and handles some scheduled domestic flights to a number of destinations in Argentina, and the smaller San Fernando Airport which serves only general aviation. It was built in 1981, and its terminal was inaugurated on 12 October 1986. The airport provides four departure gates, two arrival gates, immigration and passenger services, plus the second largest cargo terminal in Argentina.

Common requirements for entry include a high school diploma or GED, criminal records check, immunization, reference letters, and attendance at an orientation session. There are 22 Board-approved programs in Arizona. The AZBN reserves the exclusive right to determine an applicant’s eligibility. Nursing graduates must satisfy the requirements of the Nurse Practice Act and pass the NCLEX-PN to obtain a license to practice in Arizona. Additional fees include health insurance and tuition for prerequisite courses. Every nursing graduate must pass the NCLEX to become a licensed practical nurses in Arizona. In addition to passing the test, candidates must apply for licensure through the Arizona Board of Nursing after completing an accredited nursing program. After the AZBN deems you eligible to take the exam, you will receive the Authorization to Test (ATT) from Pearson Vue so you can register to take the exam. The AZBN will notify you if you pass the exam. An individual who intends to practice and assume the title of a licensed practical nurse must file a verified application for licensure along with the prescribed fee. The Arizona Board of Nursing shall furnish the license, providing that the applicant is a graduate of an approved nursing education program and has obtained an absolute discharge from sentences if convicted of one or more felonies. Therefore, any applicant whose primary residence is another compact state cannot apply for licensure in Arizona unless declaring AZ as the primary state of residency. Submit a completed licensure by exam application. Answer all required questions and mail to the AZNN. Include the non-refundable application fee of $300 plus $50 for the fingerprint fee. Fees are payable using a credit/debit card, using authorization form or personal checks pre-printed with the applicant’s name/address and payable to AZBN. Request a certificate of completion from the nursing education program if you graduated from an AZBN approved school. The institution should send the certificate directly to AZBN. Request an official transcript (sent directly to the Board) if you graduated from an out-of-state program. Enclose a copy of documentation related to your citizenship/nationality/alien status. Acceptable documents include AZ driver’s license, a birth certificate, a signed US passport, Certificate of Citizenship, Certificate of Naturalization, a tribal certificate, etc. Submit a full set of fingerprints for state and federal criminal record checks. The AZBN will mail the card to your provided address after you submit the application. The AZBN would deny licensure if you did not receive an absolute discharge five or more years prior to the date of filing an application. The AZBN has 1 to 2 months for processing applications for licensure. Therefore, the optional temporary license is usually not necessary unless your fingerprints have been rejected, and you already pass the NCLEX. Applicants for licensure must inform the Board of criminal charges within 10 days of being charged. Visit the AZBN website and go to the License Verification tab to check the status of your application. If you’re licensed in another compact state and wish to declare Arizona as your primary state of residency, you may practice using your multi-state license until AZBN issues a new license. If you’re licensed in a non-compact state and wish to practice in Arizona, you need to apply for licensure by Endorsement. A completed paper Endorsement Answer all questions and mail to the AZBN – address provided below. Include the non-refundable application fee of $150 plus $50 for the fingerprint fee. Fees are payable using a credit/debit card, using authorization form or personal checks pre-printed with the applicant’s name/address and payable to AZBN. The fee for the optional temporary license is $50. Verification of your original state of licensure using Nursys or the License Verification Form. Proof of citizenship/law presence documentation on a plain white5 x 11 sheet of paper. A full set of fingerprints for a state and federal criminal records check. You must use fingerprint cards provided by the AZBN only. You may be eligible for an optional temporary license if you meet all the requirements for foreign or US educated nurses, submit a complete application and fee, and did not answer “yes” to the questions relating to felonies and disciplinary actions. You must request the temporary license and pay the accompanying fee. Processing a request for a temporary license can take up to two weeks – an emergency (48-hour) option is available. All temporary licenses are valid for six months. Arizona LPN licenses expire every 4 years. The AZBN encourages online renewal before the license expires. Online renewal may be processed in just 24 hours compared to paper renewals, which can take up to 30 days. If you’re on probation, suspended, inactive or retired, submitting volunteer/private duty hours, and answer yes to the disciplinary questions, you must write the AZBN to request a paper application and include a self-addressed stamped envelope ($0.90). The renewal fee is $160 plus an additional convenience fee of $3.00 for online renewals. There’s a late fee of $50 per month up to a maximum $200 for late renewals. License holders must complete a minimum 960 hours of practice during the cycle or complete an approved refresher course to be eligible for renewal. Over 85% of Arizona’s LPNs work in long term care facilities as hospital employers have a decided preference for baccalaureate degree educated nurses. DSHS field offices can handle many things including EMS licensing, EMS course approvals, and help with EMS training program information. EMT schools in Texas can set their own prerequisites for entry. • Students should have a High School Diploma, College Degree, or GED to sign up for EMT schools in Texas. • EMT schools in Texas require that students submit to a FBI Criminal Background check using fingerprints. • Texas EMT training students will need a CPR for the Healthcare Provider (HCP) Card. • Students at EMT schools in Texas must agree to urine drug testing. • A Texas EMT must have proof of a recent negative Tuberculosis PPD Skin Test. • Students must complete the 3 shot series of Hepatitis B vaccinations before the Texas EMT school’s due date. • Proof of health insurance will be required from Texas paramedic students for the duration of the EMT course.

William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a colony where religious freedom was foundation of its establishment. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748.

All banknotes current on 1 January 2002 would remain valid until at least 2012. In Germany, Deutsche Telekom modified 50,000 pay phones to take Deutsche Mark coins in 2005, at least on a temporary basis. Callers were allowed to use DM coins, at least initially, with the Deutsche Mark pegged to equal one euro, almost twice the usual rate. In France, receipts still indicate the value of products in the legacy currency along with the euro value. In other eurozone countries this has long been considered unnecessary.

The feat was popularly known as \"splitting the atom\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles: Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon \n\n The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which, in 1919, he called the \"hydrogen atom\" but, in 1920, he more accurately named the proton. After his death in 1937, he was buried in Westminster Abbey near Sir Isaac Newton. By analogy with the division of biological cells, he named the process \"fission\". The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and\n\nQuestion: what did james chadwick invent?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies formed independent states that defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal democracy. The war ended in 1783 and was followed by a period of prosperity. However, the national government had no money either to pay the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even the repetition of internal revolts such as the Shays' Rebellion of 1786 in Massachusetts.

It inspired the French, Haitian, Latin American Revolutions, and others into the modern era. Although the Revolution eliminated many forms of inequality, it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war.

After nearly three years at sea Drake in the Golden Hinde returned to England in 26 September 1580 and had accomplished the feat of circumnavigating the globe. Drake was subsequently knighted by Queen Elizabeth I. After Drake's voyage, the Spanish felt vulnerable \n\n On March 23, 1573, Le Testu unexpectedly encountered Sir Francis Drake near \"Cabo de Cativas\", near Cativá, Panama. He reportedly presented to Drake a scimitar, formerly belonging to the condottiero Piero Strozzi, as a gift on behalf of Coligny. It was during this meeting, having brought news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, that he offered to join Drake in a final raid against a Spanish mule train en route to Nombre de Dios before leaving the area. An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with Drake in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. At Cartagena, Drake released one hundred Turks who were enslaved. Sir Francis Drake had been defeated in 1595 and the report alarmed Elizabeth I that she wanted to avenge or 'dirten' the defeat. At one stage she assisted an attack on a French-held island, an expedition commanded by a young Horatio Nelson. Drake spent most of her time in Caribbean waters, until being declared unfit for service in 1800 and deleted from the navy lists.\n\nQuestion: who did sir francis drake marry?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Latin itself was subject to the same assimilatory tendencies, such that its varieties had probably become more uniform by the time the Western Empire fell in 476 than they had been before it. That is not to say that the language had been static for all those years, but rather that ongoing changes tended to spread to all regions. All of these homogenizing factors were \n\n Roman names were adopted by some, and the Latin language was spread, which was greatly facilitated by the fact that many cultures were mostly oral (particularly for the Gauls and Iberians).

Starr's fellow ex-Beatle George Harrison wrote the song along with Mal Evans, the Beatles' longtime aide and a personal assistant to Starr during the making of Ringo. The track serves as a farewell from Starr to his audience in the manner of a show-closing finale, by lyrically referring to the completion of the album. During the extended fadeout, Starr delivers a spoken message in which he thanks the musicians and studio personnel who helped with the recording of Ringo – among them, Harrison, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and his producer, Richard Perry. The first take of the song, recorded on 21 July 1969, with slightly different lyrics, was released in 1996 on the outtake compilation Anthology 3, and take five of the song was released on the Abbey Road 50th Anniversary release. In May 2021, Ringo Starr said it was his favourite Beatles song in an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Keltner is well known for his session work on solo recordings by three members of the Beatles, working with George Harrison, John Lennon (including Lennon solo albums, as well as albums released both by the Plastic Ono Band and Yoko Ono), and Ringo Starr. When Ringo Starr recorded his first full-fledged pop album, Ringo, Keltner was featured on several tracks. In 1974 Keltner played on the Lennon-produced Harry Nilsson album Pussy Cats alongside Ringo (and Keith Moon) on \"Rock Around the Clock\".

Lucy appears to be in reality the same as the Lucy of Syracuse whose feast is on 13 December, but the Geminian who was venerated on 16 September seems to be a fictitious character, not to be confused with Saint Geminianus, Bishop of Modena. She was born in the Levant in the eighth century AD to a rich family living in Syria and when she grew up, she committed her life to chastity in honor of Jesus Christ. When they saw Veronica and her beauty, they decided not \n\n St. Adele (also known as Adulla) is a saint from Germany. She founded a convent in Trier in West Germany and became its first abbess, \"ruling with holiness, prudence, and compassion\". Her feast day is celebrated on 24 December. According to the legend, Lucy was a 75-year-old widow and Geminian a young catechist. When Lucy was paraded by Geminian's house, the statues of Roman gods in his home shattered miraculously and a dove made the sign of the cross over Geminian's head. He followed Lucy, asking for instruction in the Christian religion as well as baptism. Lucy Smith was born in Chicago in 1925. Her mother, Viola, died when she was two years old, and thereafter, she was raised by her father, Rev. James Austin Smith, and her grandmother, a Holiness Pentecostal minister, Elder Lucy Smith. Little Lucy showed an aptitude for music at an early age, and when she was ten years old, her grandmother sent her to study piano with Roberta Martin, a gospel performer.\n\nQuestion: where was st. lucy born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Established in 1807 as the College of Medicine of Maryland, it is the first public and the fifth oldest medical school in the United States. UMB SOM's campus includes Davidge Hall, which was built in 1812, and is the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the Northern Hemisphere. The University of Maryland School of Medicine was ranked 16th in U.S. News and World Reports 2022 rankings of \"Best Medical Schools: Primary Care\", and 27th in \"Best Medical Schools: Research\". Since 2006, the medical school dean has been E. Albert Reece. History\n \n\nChartered as the College of Medicine of Maryland in December 1807, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was the founding school of the University System of Maryland and the only public medical school in the U.S. at the time. It is the fifth oldest medical school in the country after the medicals schools at Columbia University (established May 1807), Dartmouth College (1798), Harvard University (1782), and the University of Pennsylvania (1765). A group of physicians made several short-lived attempts at starting medical schools around the turn of the 19th century, and were finally successful in 1807 when the Maryland state legislature passed the Medical College Bill, authorizing the formation the College of Medicine of Maryland. In 1812 it was rechartered as the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Davidge Hall, built in 1812 and still in use today, is the original building of the College of Medicine of Maryland. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the United States. In the 1950s, the building was named after John Beale Davidge, one of the founders and the first dean of the College of Medicine of Maryland.

Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632, although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done it before. With the help of the telescope providing a closer look into the sky, Galileo Galilei proved the heliocentric model of the Solar System. Galileo observed the phases of Venus's appearance with the telescope and was able to confirm Kepler's first law of planetary motion and Copernicus's heliocentric model. Galileo claimed that the Solar System is not only made up of the Sun, the Moon and the planets but also comets. His improvements to the telescope, astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism were all integral to the Copernican Revolution. Based on the designs of Hans Lippershey, Galileo designed his own telescope which, in the following year, he had improved to 30x magnification. Using this new instrument, Galileo made a number of astronomical observations which he published in the Sidereus Nuncius in 1610. On January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. Galileo Galilei publishes Sidereus Nuncius describing the findings of his observations with the telescope he built.\n\nQuestion: what objects did galileo see with his telescope?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

At the end of World War II, a focus on the historical, scientific, and religious was introduced into Dalí's work. The Colossus of Rhodes exemplifies Dalí's preoccupations \n\n Antoni Pitxot (Figueres, Girona, January 5, 1934 – June 12, 2015) was a Spanish Catalan painter and a longtime friend and collaborator of Salvador Dalí. Pitxot was born into a family with many artists in its ranks, among them, his uncle Ramon Pichot. He began studying drawing at the age of thirteen, and he exhibited regularly in Lisbon, Bilbao, Barcelona, and Madrid in his twenties and thirties, winning many prizes, including the Gold Medal painting prize in Barcelona's La Punyalada competition in 1965. At the beginning of the 1960s, he was a close friend of the French painter Maurice Boitel, who painted many pictures on the Pitxot family's property in Cadaqués, a small port town on the Mediterranean Sea \n\n an adolescent, he resisted the sexual advances by his girlfriend for five years until he left her, doing so mostly out of his enjoyment of being in control. Dalí opens the book with the statement: \"At the age of six I wanted to be a cook. Painted two decades after Dalí's heyday with the surrealist movement, The Colossus of Rhodes is emblematic of his shift from the avant-garde to the \n\n During the 1940s and 1950s Dalí's interest in traditional surrealism diminished and he became fascinated with nuclear science, feeling that \"thenceforth, the atom was [his] favorite food for thought\". Before painting Corpus Hypercubus, Dalí announced his intention to portray an exploding Christ using both classical painting techniques along with the motif of the cube, and he declared that \"this painting will be the great metaphysical work of [his] summer\".\n\nQuestion: where did salvador dali study art?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
