Bagdasarian sang and recorded the song, varying the tape speeds to produce high-pitched \"chipmunk\" voices, with the vocals credited to Alvin and the Chipmunks, Seville's cartoon virtual band. However, coincidentally, the home entertainment division Buena Vista Home Video (now Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) had released several Chipmunks cartoons on home video in the early 1990s. Bagdasarian Sr. died in 1972, and his son (Adam's brother) Ross Bagdasarian Jr. took over ownership of Bagdasarian Productions. He reprised the David Seville character, first in a series of novelty albums beginning with 1980's Chipmunk Punk.

The Liberals, however, lost the 1895 general election, and Salisbury for the third and last time became prime minister. He led Britain to victory in a bitter, controversial war against the Boers, and led the Unionists to another electoral victory in 1900.

On 22 June, he and his ministers tendered their resignations to the Queen, who invited the Unionist leader, Lord Salisbury, to form a government. The following month, the Unionists won a crushing victory in the 1895 general election, and held power for ten years (1895–1905) under Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. Salisbury said \"Laissez-faire is an admirable doctrine but it must be applied on both sides\", as Parliament had enacted new building projects (such as the Thames Embankment) which had displaced working-class people and was responsible for \"packing the people tighter\": \"...thousands of families have only a single room to dwell in, where they sleep and eat, multiply, and die… It is difficult to exaggerate the misery \n\n Tennant was Assistant Private Secretary to his brother-in-law H.

Her recordings include \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher,\" \"We're All Alone\", \"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love\"\tand the theme song for the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy: \"All Time High\". When the couple recorded their first duet album Full Moon in 1973, Kristofferson was the bigger recording star, having won several awards for his songwriting and scoring a massive hit with “Why Me” from his gold selling LP Jesus Was a Capricorn, while Coolidge was still developing as an artist. Although he was now an established film star, Kristofferson’s previous album, Easter Island, was a commercial disappointment. The couple’s marriage was floundering by this time - in the A&E episode of Biography about his life, Kristofferson admits to having a steamy love affair with costar Sarah Miles on the set of 1976's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea - and Natural Act would be their final studio album together. Natural Act is the third and final duet album by Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, released in 1978 on A&M Records. Albums from this era include: Reflections, Payin' Our Dues, Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind (named after their hit cover of The Five Keys song), and Movie Grabbers, which included a rendition of \"You Only Live Twice\", the James Bond motion picture theme.

After the repeal of the 18th Amendment, some localities (known as dry counties) continue to ban the sale of alcohol, but often not possession or consumption. Between 1832 and 1953, US federal law prohibited the sale of alcohol to Native Americans. The federal legislation was repealed in 1953, and within a few years, most tribes passed their own prohibition laws.

As the Supreme Court of California \n\n in a landmark 1971 decision: Following repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, the vast majority of states, including California, enacted alcoholic beverage control laws.

His second book, it followed his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk. Its foreword was written by Jackson's friend, the actress Elizabeth Taylor. The book also contains an assortment of around 100 photographs of Jackson. Dancing the Dream was published by Doubleday on June 18, 1992, seven months after the release of Jackson's 1991 Dangerous album. The book was reissued by the British publisher Transworld on July 27, 2009, following Jackson's death the previous month on June 25, 2009. Jackson promoted seven of his solo albums with music videos or, as he would refer to them, \"short films\". In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular culture and the first African-American entertainer to have a strong crossover fanbase on MTV. Not feeling that they were being paid fair royalties by Motown Records for their success as well as their desire for creative control, the Jackson 5 decided to leave the label and sign with Epic Records in 1975.

Athletes competed in skeleton for the first time, but unlike the previous Olympic Games there was no curling competition and military patrol was a demonstration event rather than a medal event. Both men and women competed in these Games, although women were only allowed to compete in the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs events. Eighty-three individual athletes won medals, but the ones representing Norway \n\n The Netherlands was the host nation for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. 266 competitors, 222 men and 44 women, took part in 103 events in 17 sports. This was only the fourth time that the United States failed to win a medal in the men's 200 metres, Wallace Spearmon finishing fourth with a time of 19.90, 0.06 seconds outside of a medal placing (the others being the 1928 Olympics, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow which the country boycotted, and the 2000 Olympics). This was the nation's twenty-second appearance at the Summer Olympics, having competed in all editions in the modern era from 1920 onwards, except the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In this edition, Brazil beat both its previous highest number of gold medals obtained at one Olympics until this games (five gold medals in Athens 2004), and its record of total medals won at a Games (17 medals in Beijing 2008 and London 2012). It was also the first time a Brazilian athlete won three medals at one Games: Isaquias Queiroz in canoeing (two silvers and one bronze). The Men's 110 metres hurdles event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal was held on July 26, 1976, and on July 28, 1976. The maximum number of athletes per nation had been set at 3 since the 1930 Olympic Congress. It was the first time in Olympic history that the United States failed to win either gold or silver in the event; the Americans had won the last 9 straight editions of the event and 15 of 17 overall, with silver (and bronze) medals in the other two times (1920 and 1928).\n\nQuestion: In what year's Olympics were electric timing devices and a public-address system used for the first time?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Like boxing rings, wrestling rings are also known by the poetic name of the \"squared circle\", which derives from how combative exhibitions would often be held in a roughly drawn circle on the ground. Around the ring are three ring ropes, one fewer than modern boxing rings, which have had four ropes since the 1970s. These ropes are held up and tensioned by turnbuckles, which, in turn, hang on steel ring posts, which also support the frame. The ends of the turnbuckles facing into the ring are padded, either individually, or with a large pad for all three similar to a boxing ring, as in New Japan Pro-Wrestling. A portion of the mat extends outside the ring ropes, known as the ring apron. The elevated sides of the ring \n\n Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition is a straight single-elimination tournament. Judges consider \"number of blows landed on the target areas, domination of the bout, technique and tactical superiority and competitiveness.\" Boxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. Boxing matches typically take place in a boxing ring, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\nQuestion: Why is the site of a boxing match called a ring when it's square?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Newton of the United States was the only runner from 1900 to return, while other significant American runners included the winners of the past three Boston Marathons: 1902 winner Sammy Mellor, 1903 winner John Lordon, and 1904 winner Michael Spring. Cuba and South Africa each made their first appearance in the event, while the United States was the only nation to have runners in each of the first three Olympic marathons. The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau and Jan Mashiani, who happened to be in St. Louis as part of the South African exhibit at the 1904 World's Fair. The now-standard marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards was run over a course that \"started and ended at the Olympic Stadium, but was not strictly out-and-back, as there were small loops near the halfway point, and on the return to the Stadium.\" The 1908 course (the first Olympic marathon at the now-standard marathon distance of 26 miles, 385 yards) was not used. The race was the idea of Tommy Leonard, an avid runner and popular bartender in Boston and Falmouth. After Shorter won the marathon Leonard was quoted as saying \"Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could get Frank Shorter to run in a race on Cape Cod?\" One year later, in the summer of 1973, with the help of a local high school track coach John Carroll, and the town's recreation director Rich Sherman, the first Falmouth Road Race was run by approximately 100 people.

Under Muammar Gaddafi's leadership, Libya had a red-white-black flag from 1969 to 1977, and it was replaced by the all-green flag from 1977 to 2011, during which it was the only flag in the world to have one color and no design. During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad. The \n\n Omar Faiek Shennib is credited for the design of the independence Flag of Libya: this flag represented Libya from its independence until 1951 to 1969, and which was re-adopted by the rebel movement during the 2011 Libyan Civil War. Many flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below). The flag of Hamas, as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology. The 1977 flag of Libya consisted of a simple green field with no other characteristics. However, after the Libyan Civil War in 2011, Libya changed its flag to the new one which was used from 1951 to 1969 back when Libya was a Kingdom. The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. The flag of the Federation of Arab Republics was the flag of Egypt, Libya and Syria from 1972–1977. The flag is a horizontal tricolour of red, white and black with a golden Hawk of Quraish placed on the center on the white stripe. The flag was abandoned in Libya in 1977 after Muammar Gaddafi established the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and adopted a green flag.

Its mandate was to get \"information on how foreign subversive propaganda entered the U.S. and the organizations that were spreading it\". In 1934, the Special Committee subpoenaed most of the leaders of the fascist movement in the United States. Beginning in November 1934, the committee investigated allegations of a fascist plot to seize the White House, known as the \"Business Plot\". President Harry S. Truman was shocked when he was informed how small the stockpile really was. By June 1948, components for about fifty Fat Man and two Little Boy bombs were on hand. These were not bombs, but components that had to be assembled by specially trained Armed Forces Special Weapons Project assembly teams known as special weapons units. The alleged conspiracy, which would have diverted the British war effort, was used to justify the internment of Sinn Féin leaders, who were actively opposing attempts to introduce conscription in Ireland.

The screenplay by Dudley Nichols is an adaptation of \"The Stage to Lordsburg\", a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox. The film follows a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory. John Ford's landmark Western film Stagecoach (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made John Wayne a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), My Darling Clementine (1946), Fort Apache (1948), and Red River (1948). Seven of the scores were for films directed by John Ford; Kathryn Marie Kalinak has written that Ford \"got great work out of the people he worked with, and often those he was hardest on produced the best work of their careers. After all, no one knew Stagecoach was going to be a masterpiece, let alone win two Oscars; up until then, no Western had ever been a masterpiece. Gruenberg soon composed an original film score under his sole credit for So Ends Our Night (1941) adapted from famous German exile \n\n A tough quiet cowboy named Rocklin (John Wayne) boards a stagecoach headed for the Arizona town of Santa Inez in the late 1800s.\n\nQuestion: Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Barrett left in 1968, replaced by guitarist David Gilmour, and Waters left in 1985; Wright died in 2008. Pink Floyd were founded in 1964 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and Bob Klose (guitars); Klose quit in 1965. Mason states that he created the track himself, whereas Richard Wright and Roger Waters stated the credit was a \"gift\" to Mason to give him some publishing income (subsequently regretted by the latter, following his acrimonious departure from the band). Syd Barrett, of English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, created the band's name by juxtaposing the first names of Anderson and North Carolina bluesman Floyd Council. Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985.\n\nQuestion: Dave Gilmore and Roger Waters were in which rock group?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Although Friendship Games officials denied that the Games were to be a counter-Olympic event to avoid conflicts with the International Olympic Committee, the competition was often dubbed the Eastern Bloc's \"alternative Olympics\". The United States and 65 other nations boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics, which were held in Moscow, Soviet Union, in present-day Russia.

The Grammar Devotional likens the phrase \"if I were a rich man\" to the Cowardly Lion's \"if I were king of the forest\" in The Wizard of Oz; both songs involve a tongue-in-cheek comparison between the character's actual condition and the one they imagine.

This would mean Matthew 19:24 commonly translated as, 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.' Would read 'rope' instead of 'camel'. To support this they claim that rope, is much more in keeping with the imagery of a needle, and that it is probably what Jesus said, and what was originally recorded. He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\" (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking. This lamb is, \"of course, the same as the lamb seen in chapter 5\", but there the lamb looked \"as if it had been slain\", whereas here it is standing triumphant on Mount Zion: \"probably the earthly one, [because] the heavenly Jerusalem of chapter 21 has not yet appeared\". The King James Version states that the 144,000 had \"his Father's name\" written on their foreheads but the majority of English translations refer to \"his name and his Father’s name\". This reading is supported by Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Epraemi Rescriptus as well as most cursives and the writings of the early Fathers of the Church. And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.

Truman Capote decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party. For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in high society. According to Capote's friend, the writer and editor Leo Lerman, Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writer's colony Yaddo that when he, Capote, became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends. Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the ball's legend. Capote's friend, author Dominick Dunne, had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary.

Paste Magazine's Bridey Heing commends Oates' ability to navigate both sides of a deeply polarizing topic, noting how, \"Ultimately, Oates does not moralize, and this isn’t a book that will comfort those who are strong in their beliefs. But in that lies the book’s value. At a time when we as a society feel so ideologically distant and yet are told that we have more in common than all that divides us, this novel rings true without being weighed down by sentimentality.\" In 2000, King published the novella Riding the Bullet over the Internet, making it the world's first mass market e-book. King said, however, that he would drop the project if the percentage of paying readers fell below 75 percent. A total of ten other novels did, however, with most titles spending only a few weeks at the top. The strongest performing title was The Naked and the Dead, Norman Mailer's first best seller, published when he was just 25 years old, which spent 19 weeks at Number 1 and more than 6 months in the top 10. It was the first \"big\" novel about World War II, based on his own experiences. The year ended with The Big Fisherman heading the list, Lloyd C.

Between 1966 and 1987, Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in the prison and his only companion was the warden, Eugene K. Bird, who became a close friend. During much of his trial, Hess claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but he later admitted to the court that this had been a ruse. He served a life sentence in Spandau Prison; the Soviet Union blocked repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win his early release. While still in custody as the only prisoner in Spandau, he hanged himself in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death, the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. At the same time the future of Spandau Prison was put to diplomatic negotiations. In 1982 a Four Power Agreement was reached, which included a statement from the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Richard von Weizsäcker, that Spandau Prison should be demolished as quickly as possible after the death of its lone inmate Rudolf Hess.

He considers it to be his most profound work on \"the loss of innocence\". Rising Sun is a 1992 novel by Michael Crichton. Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, Rising Sun deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture.

As a young adult, Mattausch trained as a forwarding agent and simultaneously took private acting lessons. Herbert's earliest movies, like Wheeler & Woolsey's feature Hook, Line and Sinker (1930), cast him in generic comedy roles that could have been taken by any comedian. He was frequently featured in Warner Brothers films of the 1930s, including Bureau of Missing Persons, Footlight Parade (both 1933), Dames, Fog Over Frisco, Fashions of 1934 (all 1934), and Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935), as well as A Midsummer Night's Dream (also 1935), a film adaptation of Shakespeare's play. He began his career in 1950 and started television and film work with roles in 12 Angry Men (1957) and Cry Terror! (1958). In a change of pace, Matthau played Albert Einstein in the film I.Q. Matthau narrated the Doctor Seuss Video Classics: How the Grinch Stole Christmas! His partnership with Jack Lemmon became one of the most enduring collaborations in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making The Fortune Cookie and would make a total of 10 movies together—11 counting Kotch, in which Lemmon has a cameo as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (although they did not share any scenes) in the Oliver Stone drama, JFK (1991). Matthau and Lemmon reunited for the comedy Grumpy Old Men (1993), co-starring Ann-Margret, and its sequel, Grumpier Old Men (1995), also co-starring Sophia Loren.\n\nQuestion: What was Walter Matthau's first movie?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The government responded with helicopters being called in to respond to the incident to hunt down the perpetrators, at the same time reassuring that elections would still take place, and that nothing had changed regarding them. It was also condemned by the Office of the Public Defender and the Organization of American States. The ambush marked the deadliest Shining Path attack in years and a resurgence of the group in order to disrupt the Peruvian general elections. Comrade José (Camarada José, nom de guerre of Víctor Quispe Palomino; born 1 August 1960) is a Peruvian communist militant, leader of the Militarized Communist Party of Peru, a offshoot of the Maoist guerrilla Shining Path. By late November 2007, DIRCOTE had identified Quispe Palomino as one of the ten most wanted terrorists in the Apurimac and Ene River Valley (VRAE). On 31 May 2009 Comrade José gave an interview \n\n expanding terrorist actions into Bolivia and Ecuador. A previously unknown group called the Revolutionary Labor Movement (Movimiento Obrero Revolucionario—MOR) claimed responsibility for assassinating the Peruvian military attaché in La Paz in December 1988, an act that the Bolivian police commander attributed to Sendero Luminoso. According to the deputy minister of interior, migration, and justice, representatives of terrorist organizations from eight countries held another meeting in Santa Cruz in February 1986.\n\nQuestion: Where did the Shinning Path terrorists operate?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his earlier car Thrust2, which reached a speed of 1,019 km/h. The date of Andy Green's record came exactly a half century and one day after Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in Earth's atmosphere, with the Bell X-1 research rocket plane on 14 October 1947. In 1997 Thrust2's record was broken by Richard Noble's follow up car, ThrustSSC, with a top speed of 1,228 km/h. The “Land Speed Record” (LSR), which was valid for 12 years, 11 months and 11 days at that time, was 622.407mph (1001.667kph) over one mile (with a flying start). The record was set on October 23, 1970 by the American Gary Gabelich with Blue Flame, a rocket car on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Richard Noble stepped up to \"bring back this record for Britain\". The time it took Richard Noble from the idea to the first concept to the successful record attempt was nine years. Thrust SSC holds the world land speed record, set on 15 October 1997, and driven by Andy Green, when it achieved a speed of 1228 km/h and became the first land vehicle to officially break the sound barrier.

The United States set up the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) to provide large-scale financial and economic aid for rebuilding Europe largely through grants rather than loans.

Punch was discouraging about his work, but in 1958 he succeeded in placing work with the \"William Hickey\" column in the Daily Express. Although in regular work, he left the Express after five years, seeing no prospects being in competition with Osbert Lancaster and Giles. In 1962 he began producing his trademark \"little man\" character for the Sunday Telegraph, and in 1979 he brought this as a regular and long-running contribution to The Times. Additionally, he made contributions to Cosmopolitan and House & Garden, as well as publishing some 20 books of his cartoons. Its name was coined by the English cartoonist and author Osbert Lancaster, as Curzon Street in Mayfair was an address popular with London high society. Giovannetti started to work as a draughtsman producing materials for the British satirical magazine Punch. There he published different comic book characters’ stories. The British humorous magazine Punch (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's Comic Almanac (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir John Tenniel, the Dalziel Brothers, and Georges du Maurier. Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term \"cartoon\" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to John Leech being known as the world's first \"cartoonist\". In 2008 the architectural historian Gavin Stamp described Osbert Lancaster's Pillar to Post (1938)—later revised and combined with the sequel Homes Sweet Homes (1939)—as \"one of the most influential books on architecture ever published–and certainly the funniest\". Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, \"a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice.\"\n\nQuestion: What is Osbert Lancaster best known for producing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The north track is served by a single car for passport controlled passengers only. The south track serves both passport controlled passengers and the general public, separated by platform dividers between the cars. An extension is underway towards the future third terminal building, at which time the skytrain service will be limited to airport staff and passport-checked passengers only.

The MRT Blue Line presently runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 people in each direction per hour. Similar to the Skytrain, the Metro uses trains supplied by Siemens which travel up to 80 km/h. Passengers can connect to the Skytrain at Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park stations. Built in 1910, the rail bridge was the first structure to span San Francisco Bay, shortening the rail route between Oakland and San Francisco by 26 mi. The last freight train traveled over the bridge in 1982, and it has been proposed since 1991 to reactivate passenger train service (connecting Caltrain on the Peninsula with ACE, BART and the Capitol Corridor in the East Bay) to relieve traffic on the road bridges, though this would entail a complete replacement of the existing bridge.\n\nQuestion: In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The formation of the organization was prompted by the disclosure of the My Lai Massacre on November 12, 1969 by Seymour Hersh, writing for the New York Times. On March 16, 1968, three companies of Task Force Barker, part of the Americal Division, took part in a search and destroy operation near the village of My Lai, in Quang Ngai Province. The killings ended only when an American helicopter crew, headed by Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr., discovered Calley's unit in the act and threatened to attack them with his aircraft's weapons unless they stopped. One of the soldiers on the scene was Ron Haeberle, a photographer for the newspaper Stars and Stripes, who took unobtrusive official black-and-white photos of the operation through the lens of \n\n Zeiger's My Lai Massacre documents the Vietnam War mass murder of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops in Sơn Tịnh District, South Vietnam, on 16 March 1968. Found guilty of killing 22 villagers, he was originally given a life sentence, but served only three and a half years under house arrest. Zeiger reveals what he calls a \"secret\" of the Vietnam War, that My Lai was not unusual for U.S. forces but actually routine. He quotes Army Specialist 5 Ronald L. Ridenhour, who wrote a letter in March 1969 to thirty members of Congress imploring them to investigate the massacre, as saying \"this was an operation, not an aberration.\" The story of the 1968 My Lai Massacre was revealed to the public by freelance American investigative reporter Seymour Hersh, who was contributing to the Dispatch News Service.\n\nQuestion: Which journalist first told the world about the My Lai massacre?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

During the Spice Girls hiatus, Mel B released her debut solo album, Hot (2000). It was briefly sold in the United Kingdom and Australia. The product's original market life was admittedly sabotaged by competitor Coca-Cola, in a \"kamikaze\" plan to create and market the diet soda Tab Clear as its competitor to Crystal Pepsi, in an attempt to mislead the public into believing that Crystal Pepsi was a diet soda. Crystal Pepsi is notable for a fanatical revival by the public decades later, leading to a corporate response with these re-releases. Its flavor is greatly similar to standard Pepsi, with the absence of caramel color allegedly making the drink less \"acidic\" tasting. She rose to fame in 1996, releasing, in two years with the Spice Girls, two consecutive number-one albums, eight number-one singles from nine worldwide hits, the biggest-selling debut single of all time and the biggest-selling album in music history by a girl group, respectively with \"Wannabe\" atop in 37 countries with over seven million records, and Spice, which peaked at number one \n\nThe Spice Girls ; Victoria Adams (\"Posh Spice\") as herself ; Melanie Brown (\"Scary Spice\") as herself ; Emma Bunton (\"Baby Spice\") as herself ; Melanie C (\"Sporty Spice\") as herself ; Geri Halliwell (\"Ginger Spice\") as herself ; Richard E.

The construction work was undertaken by Scott Wilson, Dennis's adopted son. The landmark plaque reads: \"It was here that the childhood home of Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson developed their unique musical skills. During Labor Day weekend 1961, they, their cousin Mike Love, and a friend Al Jardine, gathered here to record a tape of their breakthrough song “Surfin’.” This marked the birth of the rock group known worldwide as the Beach Boys, and the beginning of a historic musical legacy. The lineup of the Beach Boys at that time was Brian, Carl, and Dennis; their cousin Mike Love; and David Marks (who grew up in a house across the street from the Wilson home.) Al Jardine, the group's original bassist, would later rejoin the band soon before David's departure.

The film, intended as a pilot for a new television series, stars Chad Michael Murray as the Lone Ranger (the name of the Ranger's secret identity was changed from \"John Reid\" to \"Luke Hartman\") and Nathaniel Arcand as his Native American companion Tonto. Brace Beemer became the third radio voice of the Lone Ranger on April 18, 1941, after the death of Earle Graser and remained so until the series' last new episode on September 3, 1954. The experienced and popular Western film actor, Clayton Moore, was chosen to take over the role for the television series. Other well-known examples include the radio and television series Tales of the Texas Rangers, and the several Texas Ranger roles, including Chuck Norris portraying Cordell Walker in Walker, Texas Ranger. One of the most famous and popular North American folklore heroes, he is usually described as a giant as well as a lumberjack of unusual skill, and is often accompanied in stories by his animal companion, Babe the Blue Ox. The character originated in folktales circulated among lumberjacks in the Northeastern United States and eastern Canada, first appearing in print in a story published by Northern Michigan journalist James MacGillivray in 1906. ; The Lone Ranger is a fictional hero of the west who fought raiders and robbers in the Texas area.

Greg Daniels, the writer of the episode, originally pitched this episode as being more centered on Lisa's and Homer's opposing ideas on feminism. Several gags in the episode are based on what real life shows like Hard Copy would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as creating a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes. The talk show \"Ben\", which is hosted by a bear named \"Gentle Ben\" wearing a microphone on its head, reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience. Dennis Franz was the writers' second choice for the actor who plays Homer in the television dramatisation. According to the DVD commentary, the original actor was more \"barrel chested\". McMahon told Barry Divola from Stars of Oz that Ben is characterised as a \"lovely guy, he's very honest, very open.\" In the 1992 Home and Away Annual, Kesta Desmond and David Nicholls described Ben as being \"relaxed\" and \"easy-going\" for a twenty-one-year-old male. Ben's lifelong friend was Dave Porter (John Adam) and he helped Ben through school as he suffered racist taunts because of his ethnicity.

After a year of operations, the route network consisted of Bandar Seri Begawan, Hong Kong, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and Singapore. , Royal Brunei Airlines served 18 destinations, ten of them in Southeast Asia (three in Indonesia, two in Malaysia, and a single destination in Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), three in China, one in South Korea and four more beyond Asia (Dubai, Jeddah, London and Melbourne). The national air carrier, Royal Brunei Airlines, is trying to develop Brunei as a hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. It holds a daily slot at the highly capacity-controlled airport, which it serves from Bandar Seri Begawan via Dubai. Kubutambahan, 15 kilometers east of Singaraja, was decided to be the new airport site over two other candidates, Sangsit and Gerokgak, after taking into account geographical conditions, wind speed, wind direction, and other factors. Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz International Airport (مطار الأمير نائف بن عبدالعزيز الدولي), formerly Qassim International Airport, is an airport international airport serving Buraidah, Saudi Arabia. Located in the 'Mulayda' district of Buraydah and named after the former Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, it primarily serves the northern provinces of the kingdom.

His work has been exhibited in the Italian Pavilion of the 49th Venice Biennale (2001), Switzerland's national Fotomuseum Winterthur, and a solo exhibition at New York City's Museum of Modern Art. He was included in Tate's Cruel and Tender survey exhibition of 20th century photography (2003), and a European mid career survey exhibition at Museum Folkwang, Essen, which toured to the Deichtorhallen, Germany, and Whitechapel Gallery, London. Stephen Shore (born October 8, 1947) is an American photographer known for his images of banal scenes and objects in the United States, and for his pioneering use of color in art photography. In 1975 Shore received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1971, he was the first living photographer to be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where he had a solo show of black and white photographs. He was selected to participate in the influential group exhibition \"New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape\", at the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House (Rochester, New York), in 1975-1976. In 2010 he received an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society. Robert Delpire (24 January 1926 – 26 September 2017) was an art publisher, editor, curator, film producer and graphic designer who lived and worked in Paris. He predominantly concerned himself with documentary photography, influenced by his interest in anthropology. Delpire was the first to publish many notable books of photography including Les Américains (1958, The Americans) by Robert Frank, \"perhaps the most influential photography book of the 20th century\"; and Les Gitans (1975, Gypsies) by Josef Koudelka, \"one of the defining photobooks of the 20th century\". His works can be found in the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the French National Library in Paris, the National Museum of Modern Art in Canada, the European Photography Center, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the J. Paul Getty Museum. Over the course of his 40-year career Weston photographed an increasingly expansive set of subjects, including landscapes, still-lifes, nudes, portraits, genre scenes and even whimsical parodies. It is said that he developed a \"quintessentially American, and especially Californian, approach to modern photography\" because of his focus on the people and places of the American West.\n\nQuestion: What was the profession of Paul Strand (1890 - 1976)?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1967, producer Bones Howe had asked Webb to create a pop song with different movements and changing time signatures. Webb delivered \"MacArthur Park\" to Howe with \"everything he wanted\", but Howe did not care for the ambitious arrangement and unorthodox lyrics and the song was rejected by the group the Association, for whom it had been intended. in his own memoir, Jennings agreed:  The Kimberlys were a quartet consisting of two brothers from Oklahoma and their wives, who are also sisters. Three of the songs on the album are written or co-written by Harold Gay, one of the members. The album is best remembered for its version of Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park,\" which rose to #23 on the Billboard country charts and won a Grammy for Best \n\n \"Strange Fruit\" is a song written and composed by Abel Meeropol and recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939. Meeropol set his lyrics to music with his wife and the singer Laura Duncan and performed it as a protest song in New York City venues in the late 1930s, including Madison Square Garden. The song was written in collaboration between Cross, pop music composer Burt Bacharach, and Bacharach's frequent writing partner and then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. A fourth writing credit went to Minnelli's ex-husband, Australian songwriter Peter Allen, also a frequent collaborator with Bayer Sager: the line \"When you get caught between the moon and New York City\" from the chorus was taken from an unreleased song Allen and Bayer Sager had previously written together. Allen came up with the line while his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Harris recorded several albums of music, one of which, A Tramp Shining, included the seven-minute hit song \"MacArthur Park\" (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as \"MacArthur's Park\"). This song was written by Jimmy Webb, and it reached number 2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart. In the 1973 TV special \"Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La\", after singing Webb's \"Didn't We\", Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the song MacArthur Park?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Clark's next UK single \"You're the One\" would boost her UK chart profile considerably with a #23 peak but it would be the subsequent \"My Love\" - ironically a record the singer disliked - which would consolidate the stardom augured for Clark by \"Downtown\". The 1967 album release Pet Project by the Bob Florence Big Band features an instrumental version of \"Round Every Corner\", the album being devoted to songs associated with Petula Clark. The song was recorded at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured guitarist Big Jim Sullivan and the Breakaways vocal group. Beginning with her American breakout, \"Downtown,\" Clark's singles had all had higher chart peaks in the US than in the UK. Although this trend was reversed with Clark's next single: \"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\" (UK #6/US #9), Clark's last two 1966 single releases: \"Who Am I?\" Although Clark had become a fixture on the upper realms of the U.S. charts through her collaboration with writer/producer Tony Hatch on \"Downtown\", her UK singles chart success had been more hit-and-miss. It was recorded in 1965 by Petula Clark at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch in a session which featured drummer Bobby Graham and the Breakaways vocal group. Released as the follow-up to \"Downtown\", which it strongly resembles both in musical structure and the story conveyed by the lyrics, \"I Know a Place\" became Clark's second consecutive Top Ten hit in the United States, remaining on the charts for twelve weeks. 9, \n\n While overall conforming to the hit formula Hatch had come up with for Clark with \"Downtown\" - and being especially reminiscent of Clark's 1965 #1 hit \"My Love - \"Colour My World\" acknowledged the sound of the later 1960s by featuring a riff played on the sitar. Recorded in New York City, \"Colour My World\" was rush released in December 1966 in an attempt to counteract the disappointing performance of Clark's preceding single \"Who Am I?\" which had fallen short of the US Top 20 and more seriously had become the first Petula Clark single since \"Downtown\" (1964) to not rank in the UK Top 50.\n\nQuestion: Who had a 60s No 1 with Downtown?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 1994 to 1997 she played college tennis in the United States for the University of Georgia. A four-time doubles All-American, she was a member of Georgia's NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Championship winning team in 1994. She is now living in the United States. Kaplan grew up in Macon, Georgia and remained unbeaten throughout her high school tennis career at Stratford Academy. While at Florida State she was the Metro Conference singles champion in 1983 and also won two Metro doubles titles. Stephens credits her mother for supporting her career as a tennis player since she was very young. Stephens is of Trinidadian descent through her maternal grandfather Noel Smith, who came to the United States from Trinidad to pursue a career as a doctor. She has cited her grandfather as her hero and one of her biggest influences growing up. Stephens moved to her mother's hometown of Fresno in California at the age of two. Her mother Alla (born 1963) had been a 400-metre runner.

Live recordings by Hendrix are found on several albums; more recently, the Monterey version is included on Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection (2001) and Live at Monterey (2007). It was used as the closing number at a Saville Theatre show in London on June 4, 1967. Hendrix \"ended the gig by smashing a guitar handed to him for the finale ... and hurling it into the audience\". A performance recorded at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, on October 10, 1968, was released on the 1982 The Jimi Hendrix Concerts album. On August 18, 1969, Jimi Hendrix performed the American National Anthem “Star Spangled Banner” at Woodstock. On September 9, 1969, Hendrix later specified he played it because he was “An American” and “thought it was Beautiful” and the performance was not in relation to political protest. In 1966, during his residency as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Cafe Wha? in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became \"Red House\". In an effort to out-do the Who's destruction of their instruments earlier at the same event, Hendrix poured lighter fluid over his guitar and set it on fire, even though \"I'd just finished painting it that day\" as he would later remark. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine included this in their list of \"50 Moments That Changed Rock & Roll\" alongside Townshend's first guitar smashing in 1964.\n\nQuestion: Who set fire to his guitar at the Monterey Pop festival in 19676?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The rest of the principal cast had died, but Hale's real-life son William Katt played the role of Paul Drake, Jr. Her successful radio career continued for 28 years and well over 4,000 performances. Among her accomplishments was being the female lead on the dramatic anthology Brownstone Theater on Mutual. She portrayed such well known characters as Della Street on the daytime The New Adventures of Perry Mason, \"the lovely Margot Lane\" on The Shadow, and the title character on Joyce Jordan, M.D. television series and the Perry Mason series of detective stories written by Erle Stanley Gardner; Katt co-starred with his mother Barbara Hale, who reprised her role of Della Street from the Perry Mason television series. The most famous is probably Erin Brockovich, a real legal clerk whose participation in a toxic tort case became a major motion picture. In the movie Eagle Eye (2008) starring Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan, Monaghan plays a single mom who works as a paralegal.

The lyrics are so plainly mean-spirited that even Elvis Costello circa 1978 would feel sorry for her victim.\" Cilmi then re-located to London, England in 2007 to launch her musical career and complete the recording of \"Sweet About Me\". \"Sweet About Me\" was written after Cilmi was pillaging a Parisian record store for inspiration. ; Don McLean, a fan of Buddy Holly, later addressed the accident in his song \"American Pie\" (1971), dubbing it \"the Day the Music Died\", which for McLean symbolized the \"loss of innocence\" of the early rock-and-roll generation. ; In 1978, Waylon Jennings briefly added his own memories of the incident onto his song \"A \n\n Donald McLean (born October 2, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter, best known for his 1971 hit song \"American Pie\", an 8-and-a-half-minute folk rock \"cultural touchstone\" about the loss of innocence of the early rock and roll generation.

He is the son of adventurer Sir Edmund Hillary, who, along with mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, completed the first successful ascent of Mount Everest. Hillary has achieved two summits of Everest, an 84-day trek across Antarctica to the South Pole, and an expedition guiding astronaut Neil Armstrong to land a small aircraft at the North Pole. Although further from the mountains, he continued climbing and taking pupils on expeditions. Remembering Bryant's climbing skills and good humour, which he ascribed to his New Zealand heritage, and hearing of Ed Hillary's success on his first Himalayan expedition, he invited Hillary to join the party. In 2002, he and Peter Hillary, the son of Edmund Hillary, were part of an expedition to climb Everest and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first ascent. Norgay went on to write Touching My Father's Soul, a book documenting his experiences on the summit attempt. The book was notable for the frankness with which it discussed the relationship between the often wealthy climbers and the Sherpas who obtain their incomes from assisting expeditions. It noted that little notice is taken when Sherpas die, but much attention is given when those lost are clients. He was also a part of the group that scaled the Bonatti Pillar on \n\n Thumb. Sir Hillary was conscripted into the Royal New Zealand Air Force during World War II. He served as a navigator aboard Catalina flying boats in New Zealand's No. In his autobiography, Sir Hillary wrote about his second attempt to climb Joske's Thumb while stationed in Suva: \"We had come up the wrong side — underneath the ball of The Thumb....

Founded in 1903 and one of Boston's most important cultural institutions, the museum is a highly unique installation of Gardner’s private collection, considered to be a work of art in totality. 18 March – Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft: Twelve paintings, collectively worth from $100 to $300 million, are stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts by two thieves posing as police officers. By 1896, Isabella and Jack Gardner recognized that their house on Beacon Street in Boston's Back Bay, although enlarged once, was not sufficient to house their growing collection of art, including works by Botticelli, Vermeer, and Rembrandt. After Jack's sudden death in 1898, Isabella realized their shared dream of building a museum for their treasures. The building \n\n The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was constructed under the guidance of art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) to house her personal art collection. The museum opened to the public in 1903, and Gardner continued to expand the collection and arrange it until she died in 1924. She left the museum with a $3.6 million endowment, and her will stipulated that the arrangement of the artwork should not be altered and no items were to be sold or bought into the collection. In 1989, Hawley became the fourth museum director of Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. Hawley made it her mission to ensure that the institution would not only preserve Isabella Stewart Gardner’s extraordinary collection, but also serve as a dynamic cultural resource for artists, musicians, scholars, visitors, and the Greater Boston community, just as it did in Mrs. Gardner’s day.\n\nQuestion: In which American state is the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film stars Geoffrey Rush, Lynn Redgrave, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Noah Taylor, John Gielgud, Googie Withers, Justin Braine, Sonia Todd, Nicholas Bell, Chris Haywood, and Alex Rafalowicz. The film was directed by Scott Hicks. In 1997, Geoffrey Rush was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 69th Academy Awards for his performance in the lead role. the movie. John Macgregor—who was involved in the research and wrote the treatments for Shine—wrote, in a letter to The Australian, that the portrayal of the Helfgotts' father was supported not only by David's 'elephantine' recollections, but (with the exception of Margaret) by every family member and family friend he and Scott Hicks interviewed, as well as by every interviewee who had a professional or musical connection with David throughout his early life.

In 2000, Lewis starred in May Miles Thomas' drama One Life Stand, which premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and featured Michael Caine as a boxing coach who was possibly involved in a murder in Shiner, which screened at the San Sebastian Film Festival.

This highly successful movie, which garnered seven Academy Award nominations, depicts Australian pianist David Helfgott, afflicted with a severe mental disorder not named in the film but obviously schizophrenia. Geoffrey Rush as Helfgott gives a sterling performance portraying a gifted artist with continuing symptoms of his illness, and the movie is worth seeing for this alone. Unfortunately, those making the movie were three decades behind in their knowledge of the disease, and the movie implies that Helfgott's illness was caused by his having been cruelly treated in childhood by his father (Armand Mueller-Stahl), a charge that has been emphatically refuted by Helfgott's older sister.For example, Terry Teachout of the New York Daily News wrote: \"Two centuries ago, nice people went to asylums on Sunday, and gawked at the inmates.But times have changed.Today, we let the inmates out of the asylums and encourage them to live 'normal' lives.\n\nQuestion: Which movie was a biopic about the life of David Helfgott?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1998, the song re-entered the country charts and \n\n Billboard gave a positive review which said, \"The first single from The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas isn't the sort of brassy main theme normally used to launch a major movie musical: here Parton reinterprets one of her earliest exercises in pure pop writing, and while older fans may be divided over the breathier, more stylized reading she offers here, the song itself is still a lovely ballad with a soaring chorus.\" The single choice from her Hollywood flick, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, the tune is sentiment wrapped in an appropriate package replete with strings, oboe and harp in addition to a delicate rhythm section.\" Although the actual town involved in the real story of the \"Chicken Ranch\" is located a few miles north of Hallettsville on Highway 77, film makers chose the town's historic Lavaca County Courthouse square to serve as backdrop for the city scenes in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, the 1982 musical starring Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton. The town is mentioned in the Robert Earl Keen song \"Armadillo Jackel\" as the place where they pay $2.50 for dead armadillos. The town is also visited by Antoine de Maximy for the French TV show \"J'irais dormir chez vous\" (in English \"I'll come sleep in your house\"), during his journey in the United States.

In Man of La Mancha, the newly imprisoned Cervantes recruits his fellow prisoners to portray characters from his novel, with Cervantes himself playing Don Quixote and his manservant playing Sancho. Sancho sings the title song as a duet with Quixote, solos \"The Missive\", \"I like him\", and \"A Little Gossip\", plus ensemble numbers \"Golden Helmet of Mambrino\" and \"The Dubbing\".

He was picked by Woody Herman shortly before Herman's death and has led the band since 1987. He had a period in the late 1960s when he was a studio musician, although by 1969 he was hired as Herman's lead saxophone soloist. After graduating, he toured with the Jack Gillespie Band from Minneapolis then joined the Lee Castle/Jimmy Dorsey Band. In 1965, Neumann enrolled at the Berklee School of Music. After two years at Berklee, he was offered a job by Woody Herman to join Herman's Thundering Herd, with whom he toured for the balance of that year. Owen Joseph \"Sonny\" Igoe (October 8, 1923 – March 28, 2012) was an American jazz drummer and music educator who, toured with the orchestras of Tommy Reed (1913–2012), Les Elgart, Ina Ray Hutton, Benny Goodman, and Woody Herman from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s. From the mid-1940s to 1988, he performed on over 79 recordings with bands and artists, including The Buddy Stewart (1922–1950) Quintet, Benny Goodman and His Orchestra, Woody Herman and His Orchestra, Frances Wayne with Neal Hefti and His Orchestra, Rita Moss with the George Williams Orchestra, Charlie Ventura, Tony Bennett, Billy Maxted and His Manhattan Jazz Band, The Chuck Wayne Quintet, The Don Elliott Quintet, Joe Wilder, Phil Napoleon and His Original Memphis Five, Sammy Spear (né Samuel Shapiro; 1909–1975), Pee Wee Erwin, Joe Williams, Marlene \n\n Bob Haggart when he was playing in Bob Crosby's Orchestra, and was later retitled when Johnny Burke wrote lyrics for it. Introduced by the Woody Herman Orchestra, it was the band's first and biggest hit selling over a million records. Louie Bellson heard him play in Kansas City and advised him to study in New York City. In August 1955, at the age of 20, Burns left Kansas with $300 and a drum set to study drumming in New York City. Within a year, he was Woody Herman's drummer. In 1960, he was a teacher and studio musician with the NBC Orchestra, The Merv Griffin Show, and The Tonight Show. From 1968–1980, he worked for the Rogers Drum Company and traveled the world as a clinician.\n\nQuestion: How old was Woody Herman when he founded his own orchestra?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The band had an earnest, boy-next-door image similar to British invasion contemporaries such as Herman's Hermits and Gerry and the Pacemakers. The group folded in 1970, but a version of the band later resumed touring and continues to tour, often playing for veterans' benefits. \"This Diamond Ring\" hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 20, 1965, making Lewis an instant star. Lewis was Cash Box magazine's 1965 \"Male Vocalist of the Year\". Since so many studio tricks had been used on the record, the Playboys could not recreate its sound. However, by the end of 1965 only West and Lewis remained in the band. In addition to \"This Diamond Ring\", his hits include \"Count Me In,\" the only non-British Commonwealth record in the Hot 100's top 10 on May 8, 1965, (number two); \"Save Your Heart for Me\" (number two); \"Everybody Loves a Clown\" (number four); \"She's Just My Style\" (number three); \"Sure Gonna Miss Her\" (number nine); and \"Green Grass\" (number eight).

Differing direct, short-term death toll counts \nInitially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. For their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia. 2005 and 2006 UN reports debate \nIn August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term. In 2005 and 2006, a joint group of the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—acknowledging the ongoing scientific, medical, social scientific, and public questioning of the accident's death toll that had emerged over the then-20 years since the disaster—worked to establish international consensus on the effects of the accident via a series of reports that collated 20 years of research to make official previous UN, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of a total 4,000 deaths due to disaster-related illnesses in \"the higher-exposed Chernobyl populations\". However—as an April 2006 special report in the peer-reviewed, scientific journal Nature detailed in response—the accuracy and precision of this United Nations-led joint group's projected death toll of 4,000 were immediately contested, with several of the very scientists, physicians, and biomedical consortia whose work the joint group had cited alleging publicly that the joint group had either misrepresented their work or interpreted it out of context. Others have also found fault with the United Nations-led joint group's findings in the years since their initial publication, arguing that the 4,000 figure is too low—including the Union of Concerned Scientists; surviving Chernobyl liquidators; evacuees of Chernobyl, Pripyat, and other areas now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve; environmental groups like Greenpeace; and several of the Ukrainian and Belarussian scientists and physicians who have studied and treated relocated evacuees and liquidators over the decades since the accident. The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine disputed the 6,000 estimate as much too high, maintaining that a Chernobyl-cleanup-related death toll of 6,000 would outstrip confirmed liquidator deaths from all other causes—including old age and car crashes—during the period in question. In contrast, representatives of Kiev's National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, the Union of Chernobyl Liquidators, and the WHO's Radiation Protection Programme argue that both the perilous conditions in which the liquidators worked and the secrecy with which the Soviet Union shrouded the highly classified disaster cleanup efforts not only preclude dismissing a liquidator death toll of 6,000, but also indicate that the 6,000 estimate might be too low. For their part, some surviving Chernobyl liquidators have argued publicly since the declassification of additional records in the early 2000s that official records and bureaucratic assessments do not reflect the full scope of liquidators' claims of disaster-related deaths. Examples of such claims include the comments of surviving liquidators in the Prix Italia-winning 2006 documentary, The Battle of Chernobyl, as well as Valeriy Starodumov's comments in the 2011 Ukrainian documentary Chornobyl.3828, which chronicles Starodumov's, and other liquidators' work and posits its long-term effects on their lives and health. Addressing long-latency diseases in a widely cited 2008 report, the IAEA reaffirmed its August 1986 conclusion—initially reached at the first international conference on the accident (an event closed to the press and citizen observers) and made official in 2005 and 2006—of a projected 4,000 premature deaths as a result of the disaster. The IAEA based this 4,000 figure on its estimate of a 3% increase in cancers in the regions surrounding the plant, first adopting it at the 1986 conference after rejecting the finding of 40,000 projected deaths that Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official Chernobyl disaster commission—had estimated based upon his team's research. Greenpeace have projected up to a million excess, cancer-related deaths from the Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl Forum, the WHO, and other international agencies do not accept this number. Methodological debates \nThe use of differing, contested methods to identify and tally deaths—including anticipated deaths due to long-latency diseases—has also contributed to the wide range of estimates of the Chernobyl disaster's death toll. Indeed, at the August 1986 meeting of the first international conference on the disaster, the IAEA scaled down from 40,000 to 4,000 the projected disaster-related deaths estimate of Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official commission—after objecting to Legasov's use of a statistical model based on radiation data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet even estimated death tolls that have acknowledged and attempted to mitigate for such methodological debates have yielded a body of divergent estimates—including the Union of Concerned Scientists' 2011, LNT-model-based conclusion of 27,000 deaths due to the accident; the death toll of 93,000 to 200,000 that Greenpeace has posited since 2006; and Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment (published in 2007 by Russian affiliates of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, but without NYAS' explicit approval), which estimates 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity the accident released. For example, authorities have long dismissed as 'urban legend' some Pripyat evacuees' claims of high death rates among fellow citizens who gathered on a railway bridge—the so-called 'Bridge of Death'—to watch the exploded reactor's blazing fire and glowing, electric blue column of ionized air in the midst of visible nuclear fallout on the night of the accident. Indeed, some authorities have argued that post-disaster psychological trauma—sometimes characterized as Radiophobia or labeled a mental aspect of the collection of post-accident symptoms that some physicians term 'Chernobyl Syndrome'—has led some former residents of the region surrounding the plant to attribute deaths to the accident based on anecdotal evidence alone. In this vein, the Chernobyl Forum, the World Nuclear Association (WNA), and other groups posit an increase in psychological problems among those exposed to the disaster's radiation, due in part to poor communication of radiation's effects, disruption to their way of life, and trauma surrounding the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In response, some former residents of the region that now comprises the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve—including Lyubov Sirota, a Ukrainian poet and Pripyat evacuee, in her 1995, Chernobyl Poems verse, \"Radiophobia\", and her 2013 memoir, The Pripyat Syndrome—decry such questioning of survivors' psychology and discernment as efforts to dismiss and de-legitimize both evacuees' claimed long-term experience of the disaster's lethal impacts and evacuees' allegations of the accident's tangible, ongoing effects upon their physical health.

Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's 68-year-old successor, was seriously ill with kidney disease when he took over, and after his death fifteen months later, he was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko, then 72, who lasted thirteen months before his death and replacement with Gorbachev. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. Died: Nikita Khrushchev, 77, de facto leader of the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 until he was deposed in 1964, and de jure leader of the Soviet government from 1958 to 1964 as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was the leader. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko \n\n Both the cultural and the political thaws were effectively ended with the removal of Khrushchev as Soviet leader in October 1964, and the installment of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1964. When Khrushchev was dismissed, Alexei Kosygin took over Khrushchev's position as Soviet Premier, but Kosygin's economic reform was not successful and hardline communists led by Brezhnev blocked any motions for reforms after Kosygin's failed attempt.\n\nQuestion: Who succeeded Brezhnev as Soviet premier?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

From 1198 the first foundling wheels (ruota dei trovatelli) were used in Italy; Pope Innocent III decreed that these should be installed in homes for foundlings so that \n\n A baby hatch or baby box is a place where people (typically mothers) can bring babies, usually newborn, and abandon them anonymously in a safe place to be found and cared for. This kind of arrangement was common in the Middle Ages and in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the device was known as a foundling wheel. Foundling wheels were taken out of use in the late 19th century, but a modern form, the baby hatch, began to be introduced again from 1952 and since 2000 has come into use in many countries, notably in Germany, where there are around 100 hatches, Czech Republic (76), Poland (67), and in Pakistan where there are more than 300 as of 2006. The first modern baby hatch was in South Africa in July 1999 and was installed by Door of Hope Children's Mission (Hole in the Wall) at a small mission church in Berea in Johannesburg. In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative.

This was soon followed by the dismantling \n\n despite the pledges of residents. On July 8, 1980 a strike started in the WSK factory, which quickly spread to other factories in the Lublin region and brought the local economy to a standstill. However, the pressure for change generated by the strikes in turn led to the August strikes in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland's Baltic Sea Coast, which shortly after led to the emergence of the Solidarity movement. Its initial inspiration was the emergence of the independent Polish trade union movement Solidarność (Solidarity), and the massive upsurge of opposition to nuclear weapons represented by the nuclear freeze movement in the United States and the European Nuclear Disarmament (END) movement, which protested NATO deployment of cruise and Pershing missiles. In 1980, Andrzej Wieckowski assumed a leadership role in Solidarity at the University of Warsaw, a Polish non-governmental trade union, which over time evolved to become non-violent anti-communist social movement, generally viewed today as having greatly contributed to the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989–1990. Workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk ultimately went on strike in mid-August, sparked by the firing of Anna Walentynowicz. Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers seized arsenals, took control of the shipyard and demanded labor reform and greater civil rights including the rights of freedom of expression, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion, as well as the release of political prisoners. On the third day of the strike, on August 16, 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wałęsa and others announced the end of the strike, however the women of the shipyard, Anna Walentynowicz and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments.\n\nQuestion: In which city's shipyard was Solidarity set up?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In a show of sportsmanship, Sammy Sosa embraced and congratulated his rival and on-field opponent after McGwire rounded the bases. McGwire would finish the year with 70 home runs and Sosa with 66. McGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds in 2001. In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73 home runs, breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on October 5, 2001. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for base on balls with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by Babe Ruth in 1923) and slugging percentage with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by \n\nAugust 31 – Don Mattingly the former first baseman and Yankee Captain has his uniform number 23 retired by the New York Yankees in a pregame ceremony. ; September 10 – Mark McGwire joins Babe Ruth as the only players in major league history with 50 home runs in consecutive seasons by hitting a 446-foot shot off Shawn Estes in the third inning of the St. Louis Cardinals' road game against the San Francisco Giants. McGwire, who hit a major league-leading 52 homers for the Oakland Athletics last season, becomes the first player with back-to-back 50-homer seasons since Ruth did it in 1927 and 1928. ; September 28 – Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres ties Honus Wagner's record by winning his eighth National League batting title. But Hack really hit 57 that year.\" Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70). On October 4, by homering off Wilfredo Rodríguez in the 159th game of the season, Bonds tied the previous record of 70 set by Mark McGwire – which McGwire set in the 162nd game in 1998.

This flippant remark made headlines in Japan, and Ali's challenge was accepted by Inoki, whose financial backers offered the boxer $6 million for the fight. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali supposedly went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back.

Christian Olsson moved into second with a 17.28m. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier with a jump of 18.16 m (59 feet 7 inches). During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards observed that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if \"he could jump as far as he needed to\". In his breakthrough year of 1995, Edwards produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5 1⁄2 inches) at the European Cup.

The first five were shown as specials during the 1957–58 television season. Its original network title was The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show for the first season, and Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse Presents The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show for the following seasons. In the 2021 Aaron Sorkin film Being the Ricardos, Oppenheimer is portrayed as head writer and producer of I Love Lucy by Tony Hale, and as an older man by John Rubinstein.

Although Coogan and Cassidy reprised their roles, Astin and Jones did not; their parts were recast with Hanna-Barbera voice talents Lennie Weinrib as Gomez and Janet Waldo as Morticia, while a ten-year-old Jodie Foster provided the voice of Pugsley. John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, and Ted Cassidy provided the voices for their respective Addams Family characters while voice actors were used to voice Grandmama, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Cousin Itt. A reunion TV film, Halloween with the New Addams Family, aired on NBC in October 1977 and starred all of the original cast, except for Blossom Rock, who was very ill at the time and was replaced as Grandmama by Phyllis actress Jane Rose. Elvia Allman portrayed Mother Frump, whom Margaret Hamilton had played in the original series. The film also included extended family members created specifically for this production, such as Gomez's brother Pancho (played by Henry Darrow) and two additional children, Wednesday Jr. and Pugsley Jr. The latter two were portrayed as near copies of the original children, now known as Wednesday Sr. and Pugsley Sr., who were once again played respectively by Lisa Loring and Ken Weatherwax, the original Wednesday and Pugsley in the \n\n The Addams Family is an American animated sitcom adaptation of the Charles Addams single-panel comic for The New Yorker.

Undaunted, Mary enlists the aid of police cadet Tony Campbell (Kevin Dillon) to sniff out the murderer; gradually, the two fall in love. Ultimately, the name \"Tony Campbell\" is revealed to be an alias; his real name is Daniel Henry Moffat, and he proves to be the killer both Mary and Guinn are looking for. Moffat outwits and kills Guinn, only to be outwitted and killed himself by Mary. Just weeks after graduation from the 12th grade, she is seen in a police uniform - having succeeded in her aspiration of following in her father’s footsteps and joining the police department. The dental charts and fingerprints of this decedent yielded no results matching her to any known missing person, and her fingerprints matched no police records, indicating she had no criminal record. Early police efforts to identify this decedent also involved the creation of a composite drawing of her face which was published in local newspapers and broadcast on television networks on April 28, 1981. This initial media publicity surrounding the murder generated approximately two hundred leads. The victim gradually became known as \"Buckskin Girl\" in reference to the distinctive tasseled buckskin \n\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard ( Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield, lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and had the \"mental capacity of a 4-year-old due to brain damage\" she had suffered as a result of her premature birth. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose. Dee Dee had slightly changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent. Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence; after a brief trial in November 2018 Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. When she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses. In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with Rod's child-support payments and public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter's supposed medical conditions. The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation received considerable local media attention, and the community often pitched in to help the woman who now went by Clauddinnea Blancharde, and whom they knew as Dee Dee. She told her neighbors in Springfield that Gypsy Rose's father was an abusive drug addict and alcoholic who had never come to terms with his daughter's health issues and never sent them any money. In 2009, an anonymous caller told the police about Dee Dee's use of different names and birth dates for herself and her daughter, and suggested Gypsy was in better health than claimed. Officers who performed the resulting wellness check accepted Dee Dee's explanation that she used the misinformation to make it harder for her abusive ex-husband to find her and Gypsy, without talking to Rod, and reported that Gypsy seemed to genuinely be mentally handicapped. Again Dee Dee produced the paperwork giving Gypsy's false, younger birth date and threatened to inform the police. Dee Dee later told Gypsy that she had filed paperwork with the police claiming that Gypsy was mentally incompetent, leading Gypsy to believe that if she attempted to go to the police for help, they would not believe her. Gypsy, who had five separate Facebook accounts, and Godejohn flirted online, their exchanges sometimes using BDSM elements, which Gypsy has since claimed was more what he was interested in. Woodmansee tried to talk her out of it, still thinking Gypsy was too young and possibly being taken advantage of by an online sexual predator. Her plan was for him to just bump into her while she and Dee Dee were at a movie theater, both of them in costume, and apparently strike up a relationship that way, then for her to introduce him to her mother. As soon as they did meet in person for the first time, Godejohn says, Gypsy led him to the bathroom, where the two had sex. The two continued their Internet interactions and began developing their plan to kill Dee Dee. Murder\nGodejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015, arriving while Gypsy and her mother were away at a doctor's appointment. Gypsy allowed him in and allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves and a knife with the understanding that he would use it to murder Dee Dee. Gypsy hid in the bathroom and covered her ears so that she would not have to hear her mother screaming. Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in her back while she was asleep. The two had sex in Gypsy's room, and took $4,000 in cash that Dee Dee had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband's child support checks. They fled to a motel outside Springfield where they stayed for a few days while planning their next move; during that time, they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get away with their crime. They mailed the murder weapon back to Godejohn's home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked unassisted. Investigation and arrests \nAfter seeing a concerning Facebook status posted from Dee Dee's account, the Blanchards' friends suspected something was not right. While they knew that the two often left on medical trips unannounced, they saw that Dee Dee's car, modified to hold Gypsy's wheelchair, was still in the driveway, making that explanation unlikely. When the police arrived, they had to wait for a search warrant to be issued before they could enter, but they allowed one of the neighbors present to climb through a window, where he saw that the inside of the house was largely undisturbed, and that all of Gypsy's wheelchairs were still present. All who knew the Blanchards feared the worst—even if Gypsy had not been harmed, they believed she would be helpless without her wheelchair, medications, and support equipment like the oxygen tanks and feeding tube. Woodmansee, who was among those gathered on the Blanchards' lawn, told police what she knew about Gypsy and her secret online boyfriend. It turned out to be in Wisconsin; the next day police agencies in Waukesha County raided the Godejohns' Big Bend home. Both he and Gypsy surrendered and were taken into custody on charges of murder and felony armed criminal action. The news that Gypsy was safe was greeted with relief back in Springfield, where she and Godejohn were soon extradited and held on $1 million bond. Trials\nAfter the disclosure of how Dee Dee had treated Gypsy, sympathy for her as the victim of a violent murder rapidly shifted to her daughter as a long-term victim of child abuse. While the charge of first-degree murder can carry the death penalty under Missouri law or life without parole, county prosecutor Dan Patterson soon announced he would not seek it for either Gypsy or Godejohn, calling the case \"extraordinary and unusual\". After her attorney obtained her medical records from Louisiana, he secured a plea bargain to second-degree murder for Gypsy. In July 2015, she accepted the plea bargain agreement and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Godejohn still faced the more severe charge because prosecutors contended that he initiated the murder plot, and both he and Gypsy agreed that he was the one who actually killed Dee Dee. In their opening statement, prosecutors alleged that Godejohn had deliberated for over a year before the crime, while his lawyers pointed to his autism and said that Gypsy had formulated the crime and their love-struck client had just done as she had asked. The next day, prosecutors showed jurors the text messages, sometimes sexually explicit, that Gypsy and Godejohn shared in the week before the murder, often using various personas, as well as the knife which he had used to commit the murder. These were supplemented by video of his interview with police after his arrest, where he admitted to having killed her. Gypsy testified on the trial's third day. She said that while she had indeed suggested to Godejohn that he kill Dee Dee to end her mother's abuse, she had also considered getting pregnant by him in the hope that once she was carrying Godejohn's child, Dee Dee would have to accept him. Along with the knife that she eventually gave to Godejohn, she stole baby clothes from Walmart during a shopping trip so she could go ahead with either plan. Jurors had the option of finding Godejohn not guilty or guilty of one of three murder charges; involuntary manslaughter, second-degree murder or first-degree murder. After approximately two hours of deliberation, they returned with the verdict and Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action. In February 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder conviction, the only possible option since prosecutors had declined to seek the death penalty. Godejohn asked Judge David Jones for leniency on the armed criminal action charge, which carries a minimum sentence of only three years, saying that he had fallen \"blindly in love\" with Gypsy. Perry argued that the jury should not have been allowed to hear that Godejohn had considered raping Dee Dee on the night of the murder, and he also argued that the state's psychologist should not have been allowed to testify while Godejohn's psychologist should have, to establish that he had diminished capacity. Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered. In a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless. In 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role. Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. In the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.

Aleah Woodmansee, whose information about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn led police to the couple the day after Dee Dee's body was discovered, said she cried out of disbelief upon hearing that Gypsy had never been sick or disabled. Over 60 people attended a candlelight vigil for Dee Dee in downtown Springfield the night after the body was discovered. In a news conference, Sheriff Arnott said of the case \"[Springfield is] a giving community, we surround people with love and finances that we believe that needs it. Family\nDee Dee's family in Louisiana, who had confronted her about her treatment of Gypsy years before, did not regret her death. \"I think Dee Dee's problem was she started a web of lies, and there was no escaping after\", he told BuzzFeed. When Dean asked her what made her want to escape her situation, Gypsy recalled the 2011 incident at the science fiction convention, which made her wonder why she was not allowed to have friends like others of her age. While she said that Godejohn took their idle discussions of murder into reality, she accepts that she committed a crime and has to live with the consequences. \"She is already psychologically really compromised, and she's going to need as much family underpinning and support as she can get\", Feldman told Vulture after viewing Carr's documentary, in which he appears. He also points out that post-traumatic stress disorder is likely to be an issue in her continuing development. He learned of Dee Dee's murder at the hands of Gypsy and her boyfriend later in 2015 when a former nurse emailed him the news story. Feldman, in talking about Carr's documentary with Vulture, faults Carr for making Flasterstein appear to be the hero of the story. While a formal diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy for Dee Dee is technically impossible since she is dead, Feldman told the Springfield News-Leader after Gypsy's guilty plea that he could confidently say Dee Dee had it based on what he knew about the case. He said it was \"unprecedented\" in the 24 years he had been researching the disorder for an abused child to have killed the abusive parent as Gypsy did. The film includes interrogation footage and exclusive interviews with Nick Godejohn and incarcerated Gypsy Rose; it premiered on May 15, 2017. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) news and information series Good Morning America, segment \"Mother of All Murders\" aired an exclusive in-prison interview with Gypsy Rose, aired: January 5, 2018, trailer. The ABC network news magazine series 20/20, episode \"The Story of Gypsy Blanchard\", consisted of Gypsy Rose's first network interview from prison and it also consisted of an interview that was conducted with Nicholas Godejohn. The Sony Entertainment Television channel series CID aired an episode titled \"Death on Social Media\" on 13 August 2017, based on the case but the setting for the episode was changed to India; the characters Aria and Aanchal were based on Gypsy and Dee Dee Blanchard respectively. The Investigation Discovery channel series James Patterson's Murder is Forever episode \"Mother of All Murders\", season 1, episode 2, premiered on January 29, 2018. Investigation Discovery also aired a two-hour-long special documentary titled Gypsy's Revenge. Gypsy Rose is interviewed while she is still incarcerated and during the interview, she describes her relationship with her mother. Gypsy's father, relatives, and friends are all interviewed along with public officials and Nicholas Godejohn.Love You to Death aired on Lifetime in January 2019, dramatizing the case as \"inspired by true events\". Marcia Gay Harden starred as the fictionalized version of Dee Dee, Emily Skeggs starred as Gypsy Rose's counterpart, Brennan Keel Cook starred as Nick's counterpart, and Tate Donovan starred as Rod's counterpart. \"[W]hen I think about it every teenager wants to murder their parents at some point\", Harden told TV Insider. On January 27, 2019, a \"special edition\" of the film was aired that featured behind-the-scenes interviews with Harden and Skeggs. In one of those interviews, Skeggs mentioned that she wore a bald cap in scenes where her character was hairless. In 2019 the streaming service  Hulu announced the creation of the true crime series The Act. Joey King was cast as Gypsy Rose, and received an Emmy nomination for her performance; she shaved her head for the role. Actress Patricia Arquette was cast as Dee Dee, and won an Emmy for her performance. In the 2019 Netflix web television series The Politician, the characters Infinity Jackson, Ricardo, and Dusty Jackson are respectively based on Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Nicholas Godejohn and Dee Dee Blanchard.

But when he felt unwell, his teammate Luigi Musso had to run the race. Hawthorn and Phil Hill drove the car later, as relief drivers. This race was won by Nino Farina in a Ferrari, just over 1 minute ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio. Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari clinched his second consecutive World Drivers' Championship as neither Mike Hawthorn nor Juan Manuel Fangio won the race and now couldn't beat his points total with two races left. For the fourth consecutive race, Hawthorn was the quickest driver over a single lap, but his best lap of 4’ 08 was well down on his 3’ 58.7 record of 1957. It was race 1 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 1 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss in Rob Walker's privately entered Cooper T43.

However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are \"materially false or misleading\". In contrast, spam email messages are generally accepted to be unsolicited. Though they may be sale notices, coupons, social updates and the like, graymail messages are sent by reputable sources who value their relationship with the recipient. The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, widely known as \"ACMA\". Mobile phone spam is a form of spam (unsolicited messages, especially advertising), directed at the text messaging or other communications services of mobile phones or smartphones. This can be particularly annoying for the recipient because, unlike in email, some recipients may be charged a fee for every message received, including spam. Mobile phone spam is generally less pervasive than email spam, where in 2010 around 90% of email is spam.

She wrote the book as an apologia to defend her husband from perceived attacks, and to preserve his legacy. Critics generally considered the book to be \"delightful\" as a \"collection of episodes\", but especially those writing at publication predicted it would be of little historical value except for its account of Woodrow Wilson's stroke and last days in office. However it has been used by academic historians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to examine a variety of topics related to Edith Wilson.

She is one of two children from celebrity couple, model Cindy Crawford and businessman Rande Gerber who have an older son, Presley Gerber. When she was 10, Gerber landed her first modeling gig with Versace's junior line, Young Versace. Gerber took online classes at Malibu High School. In a 2018 interview, she stated \"my dad is Jewish and my mom is Christian so we grew up doing both; we call it Christmas Chrismukah. The name most commonly refers to American singer and actor Elvis Presley (1935–1977). Earlier bearers of the name include American administrator Elvis Jacob Stahr, Jr. (1916–1998, born the same year as Elvis Presley's father, Vernon Elvis Presley). People in this latter group includes those who took the name themselves (with UK-born singer and songwriter Elvis Costello being an example), and those who were named Elvis by their parents. On August 1, the Enquirer published an article naming Hunter's child. The birth certificate listed the mother's name as \"Rielle Jaya James Druck,\" while the child was given the surname \"Hunter\"; no father's name was listed. Media reports linked the Druck and Hunter surnames on the birth certificate to conclude that the mother was Rielle Hunter; the reports also noted that the child was born approximately two months after Young's claimed paternity had been announced by Hunter and Young. Fergie Reid was born in Richmond on March 18, 1925, the son of dentist Leon Reid and his wife. She is the daughter of model Cindy Crawford and businessman Rande Gerber.

The revolutionaries, headed by Sun Yat-sen, were concerned with creating a modern sense of national identity in the chaotic post-imperial era. In contrast to Chinese academics such as Liang Qichao, who tried to counter the West's fantastic version of the Great Wall, Sun Yat-sen held the view that Qin Shi Huang's wall preserved the Chinese race, and without it Chinese culture would not have developed enough to expand to the south and assimilate foreign conquerors. Sun Yat-sen, who had just stepped down as provisional president of the Republic of China, was chosen as its overall leader under the title of premier, and Huang Xing was chosen as Sun's deputy. There were attempts to incorporate democracy, republicanism, and industrialism into Chinese philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-sen at the beginning of the 20th century In 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in Nanjing as the first Provisional President.

Born in 1929 in Cairo, Egypt, Arafat soon became a supporter of Arab nationalism and anti-Zionism; in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood against the newly independent State of Israel. Beginning from 1983 onwards, Arafat based himself in Tunisia \n\n By early 2003, as Israel and the United States refused to negotiate with Yasser Arafat, it was thought that Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries. As one of the few remaining founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). While there in 1961, he was recruited to become a member of Fatah, founded by Yasser Arafat and five other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s. At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States.

Fayed was a student at Collège Saint Marc before attending the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. Fayed was the first cousin of the late Washington Post Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018. Fayed also worked for his father on Harrods' marketing. In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman. Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities. Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz's Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Al Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed's offer of a formal partnership. Al-Fayed earned £1.5 million commission from the contract for British engineering company \n\n  Mohammed Mahdi Al Tajir was born in December 1931 in Bahrain, and educated at Preston Grammar School in Lancashire. Al Tajir also owns London's Sheraton Park Tower Hotel at 101 Knightsbridge near Hyde Park and Mereworth Castle in Kent, which he purchased in 1976 for $1.2 million. In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner Hani Salaam. Al Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai's aluminum smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the Dubai World Trade Centre. In the judgement of a British court case, Al Tajir conspired to defraud Dubai Aluminium of millions of dollars in connivance with commodities trader Marc Rich, who owned a neighbouring property in Switzerland. Later that year, the London-based Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods at that time, signed a fifty-year lease on the villa.

In 2017, critics called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the persecution of Rohingya people in Myanmar. Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's US$1.3 million prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people. Around this time, Aung San Suu Kyi chose non-violence as an expedient political tactic, stating in 2007, \"I do not hold to non-violence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons.\" This, along with the release of Burma's most prominent human rights activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, and many other political prisoners, has improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations and has led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions that had been imposed by the European Union and the United States. rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, criticised Aung San Suu Kyi's response to the \"really grave\" situation in Rakhine, saying: \"The de facto leader needs to step in—that is what we would expect from any government, to protect everybody within their own jurisdiction.\"\n\nQuestion: Aung San Suu Kyi is a controversial leader in which country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Considered one of the most influential figures in the history of the motion picture, he pioneered many aspects of film editing and expanded the art of the narrative film. Together with Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and Douglas Fairbanks, Griffith founded United Artists, enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. The new company was to be made with finance from Art Cinema, a subsidiary company of United Artists, in a deal brokered by Joseph Schenck. However, when Schenck presented the deal to Art Cinema's board, it was turned down. An embarrassed Schenck decided personally put up half the cost of the three films, with the other half met by Small and Goetz. Others active in the 1930s included Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Ogden Nash, Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Maurice Rapf. The film studios responded by refusing to hire Guild members and forming \n\n Douglas Elton Fairbanks Sr. (born Douglas Elton Thomas Ullman; May 23, 1883 – December 12, 1939) was an American actor, screenwriter, director, and producer. Fairbanks was a founding member of United Artists. He was also a founding member of The Motion Picture Academy and hosted the 1st Academy Awards in 1929. With his marriage to actress and film producer Mary Pickford in 1920, the couple became 'Hollywood royalty', and Fairbanks was referred to as \"The King of Hollywood\", a nickname later passed on to actor Clark Gable. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Rowland was the head of Metro Pictures Corporation from 1915 to 1920, a studio he founded in 1915 along with Louis B. Mayer. In 1919, when Charlie Chaplin, D.W.

In the song, the main character, Tevye, explains the roles of each social class (fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters) in the village of Anatevka, and how the traditional roles of people like the matchmaker, the beggar, and the rabbi contribute to the village. The song also mentions the constable, the priest, and the other non-Jews with whom they rarely interact. and Broom-maker, the Fiddler explains why they are there: the city fathers, proud of their wealth and affluence, want the wise woman to identify a king to lead them. Happy with this prophecy, the Broom-maker and Woodcutter return to town. The Fiddler, however, has glimpsed the Goose-Girl through the window, and stays behind. His \"Fiddler on the Roof\", for example, combines a folksy village setting with a fiddler as a way to show the Jewish love of music as important to the Jewish spirit. They have come to fetch the Fiddler back to town. He swore he would never return there, but the Broom-maker says they need him: everything has gone to pieces in town; the children do not trust the adults, and there is conspiracy and mutiny everywhere. The Innkeeper's little Daughter shoves them away and addresses the Fiddler directly: the children, she says, know he was right and their parents were wrong; the King's Son and the Goose-Girl belong on the throne.

Michener's 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific. The screenplay, adapted by Joshua Logan (who directed the previous 1958 film version) and Lawrence D. Cohen, tells the story of a war-torn romance between a young American nurse (Close) and an older French plantation owner (Sherbedgia). Mary Martin said that Richard Rodgers composed songs for her for South Pacific, knowing she had a small vocal range, and the songs generally made her look her best. Both Rodgers and Hammerstein wanted Doris Day for the lead in the film version of South Pacific and she reportedly wanted the part. They discussed it with her, but after her manager/husband Martin Melcher would not budge on his demand for a high salary for her, the role went to Mitzi Gaynor. It was first introduced by Mary Martin in the original Broadway production and sung by Mitzi Gaynor in the 1958 film adaptation. In the show, Nellie sings this song after being convinced that despite the racial differences between her and Emile, there is good in him. They introduced it to Mary Martin one night when they were at Joshua Logan's house fine-tuning the script.

As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica). Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 km2, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. The AU has an area of 29922059 km2, with 24165 km of coastline. The vast majority of this area is on continental Africa, while the only significant territories off the mainland are the island of Madagascar (the world's largest microcontinent and fourth-largest island) and the Sinai Peninsula (geographically a part of Asia), accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total area. Europe is a landmass variously recognised as part of Eurasia or a continent in its own right, located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, it shares the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa, and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south and Asia to the east. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62800 km.

In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union, succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic \n\n The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is one of two treaties forming the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU), the other being the Treaty on European Union (TEU; also referred to as the Treaty of Maastricht). The Treaty originated as the Treaty of Rome (fully the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community), which brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). After tough negotiations, the Maastricht Treaty entered into force in 1993 with the goal of creating an economic and monetary union by 1999 for all EU states except the UK and Denmark (even though Denmark has a fixed exchange rate policy with the euro). In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty finalised its political authority, the Eurogroup, alongside the European Central Bank. Following the delays in the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which led to the Danish opt-outs, the treaty came into force on 1 November 1993 under the third Delors Commission. The new European Union introduced the pillar system, formalising European Political Cooperation as the Common Foreign and Security Policy and adding the new area of Justice and Home Affairs. In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed.\n\nQuestion: Which European town gave its name to a Treaty which symbolizes closer economic links between European countries?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The film was directed by David Hand and features the voices of Clarence Nash as Mickey and Donald and Billy Bletcher as Pete. This was the first and only time that Mickey was voiced by Nash; Walt was in Europe at the time and was unavailable to record his lines for Mickey, thus, Nash took over. Mickey's Service Station is a 1935 animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by United Artists. The film, which stars Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy as car mechanics, was also the final black-and-white appearance of Donald, Goofy, and Pete and the penultimate animated black-and-white film produced by Disney after Mickey's Kangaroo which was released later the same year. It was also the first team-up of the classic trio of Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. Thomson began his career in 1935 at Leon Schlesinger Productions (Warner Bros.) as an animator. He was first an animator and worked on Mickey Mouse, Silly Symphonies, and Donald Duck short films. He also worked on the feature-length film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" segment of Fantasia (1940). Later audiences would comment on all three early versions of Mickey Mouse characters as seeming to come out of rough, lower class backgrounds that little resemble the later versions of Mickey Mouse. When the cartoon starts Mickey and Minnie have the same eyes as they have in Plane Crazy, but once Black Pete appears they suddenly have the dot eyes from Steamboat Willie. The mostly adult audience had become bored with what came to be called \"rubber hose\" animation. Symphony Hour is a 1942 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures.

It is introduced to the protagonists Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist 'Professor Savant', a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain.

Riley and written by Tom T. Hall. Riley, who was working as a secretary in Nashville for Jerry Chesnut, got to hear the song and recorded it herself and it became a massive hit for her. The song later inspired an eponymous 1978 motion picture and short-lived 1981 television series, both starring Barbara Eden playing the heroine of the story, Mrs. Johnson, who now had a first name, Stella. Parton also covers the Jeannie C. Riley hit \"Harper Valley PTA\", Tammy Wynette's \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\", and Porter Wagoner's hit, \"The Carroll County Accident\". The series went on to flesh out the story in the song, as it told of the adventures of Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden), a widowed single mother to teenager Dee (Jenn Thompson), who lived in the fictional town of Harper Valley, Ohio. The town was dominated by the namesakes of the founder, the Harper family, most prominently represented by the mayor, Otis Harper, Jr (George Gobel). Mrs. Johnson's flouting of the small town's conventions, and exposure of the hypocrisy of many of its other notorious residents provided the humour.

At the same time the term ANARE fell out of official use the 'globe' logo was also discarded in favour of the Australian coat of arms to bring the livery of the AAD in line with the rest of the Australian Public Service. However like the ANARE name the logo continues to be used on an informal basis by expeditioners each year in the production of Antarctic Station badges, T-shirts and other memorabilia. Soon after being appointed Antarctic Division director in 1949, Dr. Phillip Law saw the need for a recognisable symbol for the fledgling ANARE. His wife, Nel, was an artist and produced the distinctive and enduring circular emblem that Dr Law described as \"...a circular badge whose centre is the Antarctic Continent with the Australian sector shaded.

Berry often performed the song live. It is included on the 1969 album Chuck Berry Live in Concert, and in the 1987 film Hail! His grandfather is Leonard Chess, who started Chess Records in Chicago in 1950. Chess Records was the label of artists including Chuck Berry, Etta James, Bo Diddley, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and Muddy Waters. Chess's father, Marshall Chess, is a record producer who formed Rolling Stones Records in 1970, which he ran for seven years. As a young man, Chess worked at Arc Music Group, the publishing arm of Chess Records, managing the blues catalog. He worked with the company's catalog and focused on remix projects, digital licensing and synchronization licensing. The record features two covers: \"Connection\" by the Rolling Stones, and Chuck Berry's classic \"Let it Rock.\" Berry's version was originally released as a single by Chess Records in May 1956, with \"Drifting Heart\" as the B-side. \"Roll Over Beethoven\" has been released numerous times on compilation albums, including Chuck Berry Twist and The Chess Box.\n\nQuestion: On which label did Chuck Berry record in the 1950s and 1960s?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2008, the museum inked a US$18 million deal for Louvre Atlanta, a three-year revolving loan of art from the Musée du Louvre in Paris, resulting in the museum's highest attendance ever. The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially \"the Met\", is the largest art museum in the United States. With 6,953,927 visitors to its three locations in 2018, it was the third most visited art museum in the world. Its permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among seventeen curatorial departments. The director, currently Max Hollein, is responsible for acting as a \"curator, lawyer and diplomat\", according to The Wall Street Journal. Based in Los Angeles, California, it operates the J. Paul Getty Museum, which has two locations – the Getty Center in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles and the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. Its other programs are the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.

The agreement provided that the children would be raised by Katherine and Rowe would have visitation rights and would continue to receive the yearly payments to which Michael had agreed. As of 2011, Jackson resided at her home in Calabasas, California with her grandson, TJ Jackson, and his family. Jackson moved out of her Hayvenhurst home in Encino, California due to house renovations. On July 25, 2012, \n\n In his early 20s, while moonlighting in a blues band with his brother Luther, Joe met Katherine Scruse, whom he married in November 1949. (This was his second marriage, following a brief marriage that was annulled.) Joseph was alleged to have had a lasting extramarital affair. Katherine filed for divorce on March 9, 1973, with a Los Angeles County clerk, but she decided to drop the divorce papers. The following year, Joseph fathered a daughter with Cheryle Terrell who was named JohVonnie. This led Joseph and Cheryle to a 25-year-long affair while raising JohVonnie. Katherine attempted once again to divorce her husband in 1982, but again was persuaded to drop the action. Joseph then moved to Las Vegas, with Katherine remaining at the Jackson family home Hayvenhurst in Encino, California. Despite living separately, Katherine and Joe remained legally married until his death in 2018. Katherine denied rumors that she and Joseph were estranged. Throughout the career of African-American singer Michael Jackson, there was intense speculation and criticism about his physical appearance, physical and mental health, and sexuality. He first became famous as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. Jackson said he had been physically abused by his father and had not had a childhood. As an adult Jackson's appearance began to change, as his nose became thinner and his skin lightened. Media reports and criticism stated that he wanted to look more white and had extensive cosmetic surgery that resulted in a public discussion about his mental health. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. To treat the condition, he used makeup to even out his skin. When the condition got worse Jackson used prescription creams to depigment his skin. Over years a lot of different rumors about Jackson's sexuality and the paternity of his children circulated. In 2005 he was acquitted on child sexual abuse. Jackson also suffered from dehydration and insomnia. In 1993 Jackson revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was suffering from vitiligo. Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62 million Americans. Jackson was criticized for hiding it by bleaching, and some even cast doubt on whether he suffered from vitiligo. In late 1993 Jackson's skin disorder became relevant for the investigations into sexual child abuse accusations against him. A search warrant was served on Jackson allowing authorities to examine and photograph any part of the singer's body including his private parts. Shortly after Jackson's death, FDA-approved creams to treat vitiligo (Benoquin and hydroquinone) had been found in Jackson's residence. Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid drawing attention to his skin. World Vitiligo Day is held on Jackson's passing day. Jackson contradicted those reports in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk saying he only had had two rhinoplasties. Jackson had told Patrick Treacy that he been suffering from a facial hypersensitivity caused by a botched cosmetic surgery. Jackson's second wife Debbie Rowe, who had met Jackson while she had been working for Klein, said she had been designated to help him through procedures. Jackson however, said that he had a dimple created in his chin attributing the other changes in the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. He also denied allegations that he had altered his eyes. Jackson said he had a tough time when he reached puberty. People hadn't recognized expecting 'cute Michael' they used to know, and Jackson said they had seemed to be surprised that he was undergoing natural changes during puberty. In the unedited version of the documentary Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson was asked about his cheeks; he answered: \"These cheekbones? Jackson consumed a lot of water, preventing dehydration and voice problems. Jackson appeared in court wearing a T-shirt, a blazer, pajama bottoms and slippers. On March 21, Jackson arrived in court accompanied by a doctor. It is believed that he suffered from back problems again. During the trial, Jackson occasionally needed help to get to his seat. Jackson's spokeswoman, Raymone Bain, said \"stress contributed to the back problem.\" In September 1992, a concert in Gelsenkirchen, Germany was canceled because Jackson was ill with the flu. His private doctor attended to Jackson in Istanbul. According to organizers, Jackson's \"vocal cords were irritated.\" Jackson was seen by a throat specialist in London and was advised to seek further treatment in Los Angeles. People around Jackson took precautions to keep him healthy. One of the measures was that Jackson wore a surgical mask during air travel. One week later, the jury selection for the child molestation trial resumed in Jackson's presence. Insomnia\nIn his final months Jackson was suffering from insomnia. Jackson went to bed with classical music playing on a sound system and Donald Duck playing on a computer. He told Lee: “All I want is to be able to sleep. He is exhausted with this kind of thing.”\n\nDrug use\n\nPainkillers\n\nIn November 1993, Jackson announced that he was dependent on painkillers; he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery, and the painkillers had been prescribed. In a taped statement Jackson said: \"The pressure resulting from these false allegations, coupled with the incredible energy necessary for me to perform, caused so much distress that it left me physically and emotionally exhausted. His lawyers said Jackson would be treated for dependency overseas for one and a half months to two months. In December 1993, Jackson returned to the United States. In November 1993 two lawyers, who had seen Jackson a few days before he had canceled his tour, described their impressions in a sworn declaration. Jackson's lawyer said these swings had continued over the next few days. She said she had been ”deeply concerned“ about Jackson's health. Propofol\nCherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he had asked her for unspecified \"products for sleep\". Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before and that he had been told it was safe. After Jackson's death Lee said in an interview: “He wasn’t looking to get high or feel good and sedated from drugs. This was a person who was seeking help, desperately, to get some sleep, to get some rest.”\n\nPatrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who had treated Jackson while he had been living in Ireland in 2006, stated that he had never seen any drugs in the house and had never been asked for narcotics. Jackson had always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol had been administered. Sexuality\n\nThere have been a lot of different rumors regarding Jackson's sexuality. People wondered whether he was homosexual or heterosexual. Some thought he was asexual. In the early 1980s, media reports stated that Jackson had never had a school chum or a steady girlfriend. Jackson later stated he had been too embarrassed to approach girls in school although he had liked them. He stated he had become romantically involved with actresses Tatum O'Neal and Brooke Shields. In 1993 Oprah Winfrey asked him if he was a virgin, which Jackson refused to answer, saying that would be something very private. Winfrey later admitted that the question had been embarrassing. Later that year Jackson was accused of having sexually abused a boy. In 1994 Jackson married his first wife Lisa Marie Presley. Presley said in an interview that the couple had sex. In early 1996 Presley filed for divorce. At the end of that year Jackson announced that his longtime friend Debbie Rowe, who had been working as a nurse for Jackson's dermatologist, was six months pregnant with his baby. He denied reports stating Rowe had been inseminated artificially. Rowe is the mother of two of Jackson's children. Jackson later said that many single mothers have children and fathers should have the same opportunity. In late 1999 she filed for divorce. Media reports state Jackson's third child was carried by a surrogate whose identity is unknown. Jackson said he had signed a  contractual agreement not to talk about her. During a child molestation trial against Jackson in 2005 prosecutors showed the jury a collection of heterosexual adult magazines that had been found during a police raid in 2003. Mental health\n\nAppearance\nJackson's physical changes attracted widespread media coverage and criticism from the public. Some African-American psychologists argued that Jackson was a poor role model for black youth. Dennis Chestnut said Jackson had given \"black youth a feeling that they can achieve\", but might encourage them to believe they had to be esoteric and idiosyncratic to be successful. Halford Fairchild said Jackson and other African-American celebrities would try \"to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television\". When Jackson was approached in 2003 about people thinking he was obsessed with cosmetic surgery because of his distressed childhood he replied: “Well, I know what’s inside my head. That’s all.“\n\nIn his interview in 1993 Jackson also talked about the impact the speculations about his skin color had on him. \"It is something I cannot help,\" said Jackson. Jackson publicly said that he was proud to be black. Jackson's paternity of his three children is questioned in public due to their light skin color. Another theory says Jackson didn't want to look like his father. People close to Jackson say he didn't want to remove himself from the race. Eccentric lifestyle\nIn September 1986 the National Enquirer reported Jackson would sleep in an oxygen chamber to turn 150. Later editor Nick Maier declared that the story wasn't true. He said a polaroid of Jackson lying in the chamber was provided by Jackson's press representative. And Michael Jackson did exactly that. In the end, that backfired…“ Jackson used his eccentric image to cover his skin condition before speaking about it in public. Jackson said the acne had had a bad effect on his personality and depressed him. Jackson stated in his biography he had one of the most difficult periods in his life when he was making Off the Wall. Childhood\n\nIn his memoir Jackson described the relationship with his father Joe as “turbulent.” He stated he wouldn't know his father Joseph and had never been able “to have a real closeness with him.” He said Joseph found it hard to relate to his children beyond family business. Jackson said he had fought back and had hidden himself under tables. In his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey Jackson said there had been times when he had been so scared of his father that he would get sick and start to regurgitate when Joe had come to see him. In 2003 his father admitted having whipped Jackson with a switch and a belt. In a speech held at Oxford University in March 2001 Jackson said that his father had never shown him love. He said he had forgiven his father and encouraged parents to spend more time with their children. Jackson stated that he wouldn't have been so successful if Joseph hadn't been as strong. Jackson also said he missed a lot of his childhood. In his mid 30's Jackson said he was compensating for his lost childhood. Later he released a song about it. Child abuse allegations\nIn November 1993 Jackson's then lawyer Bertram Fields announced that his client would be treated for painkillers outside the U.S. He was barely able to function on an intellectual level.\" Later he stated: ”It was important to tell the truth. The lawyer resigned a few days later. The week before Jackson had given two depositions in a copyright issue. One of the plaintiffs‘ lawyers said: ”[Jackson] didn’t look tired at all. Health problems in June 2009\nAfter Jackson's death nurse Lee stated that she had received a frantic call on June 21, 2009 from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide had reported that Jackson had been feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She had advised the aide to take him to the hospital. Murray went to Jackson's residence and administered medical care. Jackson slept for several hours while Murray was at his bedside. On arrival Jackson was asystolic. Death was pronounced at 2.26 pm. Murray stated he had feared Jackson had been becoming addicted. Murray only handed over few documents referring to sporadic medical care he had provided since 2006 but no records referring to treatments in Jackson's final months. Following Jackson's death, a police warrant issued against his attending physician, Conrad Murray, said that Jackson's many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases while prescribing medications for Jackson. Police found a CD mentioning the \"Omar Arnold\" alias when they raided the Las Vegas, Nevada home and office of Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician. Second autopsy\nJackson's family sought a second autopsy which was performed by a private pathologist on June 27, 2009. Reverend Jesse Jackson said the family had a lot of questions. According to Sennef Murray said: “No he’s not taking anything. I just gave him a little bit of Lorazepam to help him sleep.” Murray told Sennef he had treated Jackson for dehydration and exhaustion. Blunt said when they prepared to transport Jackson to the hospital he saw Murray putting three bottles into a black bag. She said that Jackson had been “clinically dead” when he had arrived Cooper said Murray had told her Jackson had regularly taken valium and flomax and that he had given Jackson 2 mg of lorazepam via IV. After the second dose, Jackson went into arrest. He also said that, in his opinion, Jackson “was healthier than the average person of his age” and that the arteries around Jackson's heart were free of fat and cholesterol, which is unusual for a 50-year-old individual. Demerol injections\nShortly after Jackson's death speculation about his use of demerol surfaced. Murray's legal team argued that Jackson's insomnia had been caused by demerol and therefore he had needed propofol to get to sleep. According to medical records Klein had given Jackson botox and restylane to treat wrinkles and excessive perspiration. He said Jackson told him his insomnia was caused by “his creative mind always racing.” The expert testified he believed there was evidence that Jackson had been dependent on demerol, “possibly” addicted. The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. Her divorce had not been made final, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made.

December 1800 was set as the deadline for completion of government buildings in the new capital. The nascent city was named after President Washington, and the federal district surrounding it was named Columbia, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. The Act also moved the temporary capital from New York City to Philadelphia as of 1791. Congress adjourned its last meeting in Philadelphia on May 15, 1800, and the city officially ceased to be the nation's seat of government as of June 11. In June 1800, Adams made his first official visit to Washington; amid \n\n inauguration the following year on March 4, 1801. ; United States Capitol building construction continues with partial completion of the north Senate wing where the United States Congress meets for its first sessions in Washington. ; Washington Navy Yard established on the Eastern Branch (later known as Anacostia River) of the Potomac River waterfront south of the under-construction Capitol. Another prominent hospital in Washington, D.C. is the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Due to a new Department of Defense base realignment plan, Walter Reed is scheduled to move in 2011 to a facility in Bethesda, Maryland near the National Naval Medical Center. The George Washington University Medical Center treated President Reagan in 1981 after a failed assassination attempt; the hospital's emergency department is named in his honor. Providence Hospital in Northeast D.C. was chartered by Abraham Lincoln in 1861\nand was the city's oldest hospital in continuous operation until closure in 2019. The hospital is a National Historic Landmark but has since fallen into disrepair and serves only a small number of patients. The District of Columbia General Hospital near Capitol Hill was the city's only public health care facility. ; 1877 - Washington Post newspaper begins publication. ; 1881 ; February: Flood. ; \"Tiber Canal filled in to become Constitution Avenue.\" ; American National Red Cross headquartered in city. ; 1885 - Washington Monument dedicated. ; Population: 230,392. ; 1893 - American University founded.

Greek ἂνθρωπος (mycenaean *Anthropos) means \"low-eyed\", again probably contrasting with a divine perspective. A claim of dominance of humanity alongside radical pessimism because of the frailty and brevity of human life is asserted in the Hebrew Bible Genesis 1:28, where dominion of humans is promised, but contrarily, the author of Ecclesiastes, bewails the vanity of all human effort. The game's title is a pun on the proverb \"To err is human, to forgive divine\" by Alexander Pope, whose namesake may have been given to the character Gwydion once it is later revealed who he really is in the game. In the medical world, to err is human, to test is divine.Otherwise, body tissue must be broken down to supply vital areas of the body with essential magnesium.6,7\n\nMAGNESIUM TESTING\n\nYou've heard the saying \"To err is human, to forgive is divine\"?PART FOUR\n\n> Testing and Supplements\nCHAPTER 12\n\nMagnesium Requirements, Testing, and Sources\n\nMAGNESIUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for nutrients is set at the minimum level to stave off deficiency symptoms, not at the maximum that ensures good health. A famous quote of Shakespeare's Hamlet (II, ii, 115–117), expresses the contrast of human physical beauty, intellectual faculty, and ephemeral nature: \"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in apprehension, how like a god! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?\" René Descartes famously and succinctly proposed: Cogito ergo sum (French: \"Je pense donc je suis\"; English: \"I think, therefore I am\"), not an assessment of humanity, but certainly reflecting a capacity for reasoning as a characteristic of humans, that potentially, could include individual self-reflection.\n\nQuestion: \"Who said, To err is human but it feels divine?\"\"\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song stayed at number one \n\n The Bobby Vinton Show was Bobby Vinton's twenty-seventh studio album and his third studio album for ABC Records. It features 13 songs that were sung by Vinton on his half-hour variety show of the same name. The album begins with the show's theme song, an instrumental version of Vinton's huge hit \"My Melody of Love\"; otherwise the remainder of the tracks are cover versions of popular songs of the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1961, a song copyrighted in 1955 by Sovine and co-writer Dale Noe became a sizeable hit on the pop chart. The tune was the ballad \"Missing You\", arranged in Countrypolitan style and was recorded by Ray Peterson for his own Dunes label. In 1963, Sovine passed on the helping hand given him by older performers when he heard the singing of minor league baseball player Charley Pride and suggested that he move to Nashville, Tennessee. His most successful songs were \"Roses Are Red (My Love)\", which was a number one hit for Bobby Vinton in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100; and \"When\", a chart topper in the UK Singles Chart and #5 in the U.S. for The Kalin Twins.\n\nQuestion: Which singer had a big 60s No 1 with Roses Are Red?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, US, attended by 89,484 people. On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative were held in other countries, such as the Soviet Union, Canada, Japan, Yugoslavia, Austria, Australia and West Germany. Phil Collins performed at Wembley, then boarded a helicopter to London Heathrow Airport and took a British Airways Concorde to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to perform at the American segment of Live Aid at JFK Stadium on the same day. The charisma of the band was shown through their lead singer Freddie Mercury who conducted the audience through his performance to ignite passion. On 13 July that year, in advance of the album's release, the band performed the song with Rodgers, Madonna and guitarist Steve Stevens at the concert held at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia that formed the US part of Live Aid. The concert was watched by a television audience estimated at 1.5 billion and raised $80 million for African famine relief. On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.

It was also the final use of Apollo hardware for its original purpose (extra Apollo spacecraft were later used in the Skylab and Apollo–Soyuz programs). The mission broke several crewed spaceflight records, including the longest Moon landing, greatest distance from a spacecraft during an EVA of any type (7.6 kilometers, a record which still stands), longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities (22 hours 4 minutes), largest lunar sample return (110.52 kilograms or 243.7 lb), longest time in lunar orbit (6 days 4 hours) and most lunar orbits (75). Apollo 11 (July 16–24, 1969) was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. Its crew consisted of Commander Eugene Cernan, Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt, and Command Module Pilot Ronald Evans. The final stop before returning to the LM was Camelot crater; throughout the sojourn, the astronauts collected 34 kg of samples, took another seven gravimeter measurements, and deployed three more explosive packages.\n\nQuestion: Which was the longest moon landing?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Wolkoff was personally paid about $500,000 for the inauguration. The committee spent more than $1.5 million at the Trump International Hotel. Ivanka Trump helped negotiate a rate of $175,000 per day for the committee's use of the hotel's Presidential Ballroom and meeting rooms after Gates and Wolkoff complained that Trump International Hotel managing director Mickael Damelincourt attempted to charge them above-market rates. However, CNN served nearly 27 million streams in 2009 for Obama's inauguration. CNN reported in 2009 that 7.7 million people watched the inauguration online, while nearly 27 million watched streaming video of any sort on CNN's website on that day. In his inaugural address, Bush said: \"I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. In a press conference on January 21, Sean Spicer, Trump's White House press secretary, stated that the crowd \"was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe\", and accused the media of reporting false crowd estimates to \"lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration\". In fact, 570,557 Metro trips were taken on the day of Trump's inauguration, compared to 1.1 million on Obama's 2009 inauguration day and 782,000 on Obama's 2013 inauguration day. The inaugural committee raised an unprecedented $107 million \"from wealthy donors who gave $1 million or more.\" This was twice the amount raised by any previous inauguration committee. Observers agree that the actual inauguration expenses would have been a fraction of that amount, and the advocacy group Public Citizen has been seeking to know what happened to the remaining funds. An unspecified amount had also been used for redecorating the White House and Vice President Mike Pence's Washington residence.\n\nQuestion: Who had the most expensive presidential inauguration ceremony of the 20th century?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Between Weizmann's death and the winner of the election, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, taking office on 16 December, Knesset speaker Yosef Sprinzak served as acting president. In fact, the Israeli IAF's fighter pilot, Major-General Ezer Weizman, the former Israeli President (1993–2000) and Defence Minister (1977–80), wrote in his autobiography that: \"He was a formidable fellow and I was glad that he was Pakistani and not an Egyptian\". Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\".\n\nQuestion: Who became Israel's head of state in 1993?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His direct subordinate Adolf Eichmann headed the Gestapo's Office of Resettlement and then its Office of Jewish Affairs (Referat IV B4 or Sub-Department IV, Section B4). During the Holocaust, Eichmann's department within the Gestapo coordinated the mass deportation of European Jews to the Nazis' extermination camps. At this Wannsee Conference, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler's deputy and head of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Main Office, or RSHA), noted the numbers of Jews to be eliminated in each territory. It was led by the SS functionary Walter Rauff, who helped develop the mobile gassing vehicles the Germans used to murder Russian prisoners and Jewish people in Russia and Poland. On 27 May 1942 in Prague, Reinhard Heydrich – the commander of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), acting governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and a principal architect of the Holocaust – was attacked and wounded in an assassination attempt by Czechoslovak resistance operatives Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. Heydrich died of his wounds on 4 June 1942. He was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and an important figure in the rise of Adolf Hitler. The assassination, codenamed Operation Anthropoid, was carried out by soldiers of the Czechoslovak Army after preparation and training by the British Special Operations Executive and with the approval of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, led by Edvard Beneš. The Czechoslovaks undertook the operation to help confer legitimacy on the government-in-exile, and to exact retribution for Heydrich's brutal rule. A committed anti-Semite and fanatical Hitler loyalist, Kaltenbrunner oversaw a period in which the genocide of Jews intensified. He was the highest-ranking member of the SS to face trial at the first Nuremberg trials, where he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nQuestion: In WWII, who was the head of the Nazi party's security service?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On learning that Michigan's rival, the University of Chicago, was sending a delegation of athletes to the games in Paris, Pattengill led a fundraising effort to send some of Michigan's best athletes to the games. The effort raised sufficient funds to send four Michigan athletes and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick to Paris. One of the highlights for Michigan athletics during the Pattengill's time as chairman of the Athletic Boards came at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, which have sometimes been referred to as the \"Michigan Olympics.\" The Michigan medal winners were Archie Hahn (gold medals in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters), Ralph Rose (gold medal in the shot put, silver medal in the discus, and bronze medal in the hammer throw), Charles Dvorak (gold medal in the pole vault), Fred Schule (gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles), and William Coe (silver medal in the shot put). The Fair hosted the 1904 Summer Olympic Games, the first Olympics held in the United States. The games had originally been awarded to Chicago, but when St. Louis threatened to hold a rival international competition, the games were relocated. With travel expenses high, many European athletes did not attend, nor did the founder of the modern Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin. The 1904 Summer Olympics have been called the \"Michigan Olympics\" due to the fact that University of Michigan athletes (including Schule, shot putter Ralph Rose, sprinter Archie Hahn, and pole vaulter Charles Dvorak) won ten medals, including six gold medals. The United States is the nation that has won the most medals in athletics at the Olympic Games, around 795, of which 332 are gold.\n\nQuestion: In the 1904 Olympics, how many of the 23 track and field titles were won by Americans?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, had stepped out of a limousine and walked toward the building's entrance when Mark David Chapman shot him four times in the back. Lennon was dead on arrival at Roosevelt Hospital. The Dakota has historically been home to many artists, actors, and musicians, including John Lennon, who was murdered in the archway of the building in 1980. British musician John Lennon, a building resident, was shot dead by Mark David Chapman outside the building on December 8, 1980. The book disputes the official view of Lennon as a contented househusband raising his son Sean and baking bread while Yoko ran the family business. Instead, Nowhere Man portrays Lennon's daily life at the Dakota as that of a \"tormented superstar, a prisoner of his fame, locked in his bedroom raving about Jesus Christ, while a retinue of servants tended to his every need.\" After the death of John Lennon, on December 8, 1980, public awareness of The Hit Factory increased; Lennon's final album had been recorded at The Hit Factory at 353 West 48th Street. Mourners and music fans around the world read accounts of the murder in newspapers on the days following the shooting, and The Hit Factory was mentioned in some of these publications. However, there are contradictory reports as to whether he was recording at The Hit Factory or the nearby Record Plant the day he was murdered. Most publications cite the Record Plant as the location. Witnesses present with John Lennon, such as producer Jack Douglas, cite the Record Plant as the studio where he spent his time recording and mixing tracks the evening of the murder. However, Keith Badman, not an eyewitness, in his book The Beatles: After the Break-up, 1970–2000 states that Lennon had been at The Hit Factory the night of his murder. He also references that Lennon had been at the studio the last several days working on and mixing tracks for Yoko Ono.\n\nQuestion: In which city was John Lennon murdered?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Warden set a new transcontinental speed record when they flew this airplane from Long Beach, California, to Bolling Air Force Base, in Washington, D.C., in just five hours, 17 minutes.

In particular, the book seemed to slur the character of Anne Sullivan's husband, writer-publicist John Macy, who was close to Keller's age. A relationship between Macy and Keller has long been a subject of speculation. Esther's reporter friend was reminiscent of Keller's highly publicised attempt to elope with reporter-secretary Peter Fagan.

A member of the Cavendish family, he was educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge. He held that seat until he inherited his uncle's dukedom in 1908.

The son of James King and Agnes Munn, both natives of Scotland, he was born in Hastings County and was educated in Chatham, in London, at Trinity University and at the University of Western Ontario. In 1909, he married Mary Nicoll. Robert Randolph Bruce (July 16, 1861 – February 21, 1942) was an engineer, mining proprietor and the Lis13th Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia from 1926 to 1931. Bruce was born in Scotland and educated at the University of Glasgow where he studied engineering. He purchased land from the railway and promoted it in England for settlement. Unusually for former viceroys, he attempted to enter politics following his tenure as the Queen's representative and stood for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1935 federal election but was narrowly defeated by Henry Herbert Stevens in the riding of Kootenay East. He served for two years before retiring to Montreal. In the bustle over the king's death, there was little fanfare around Massey's appointment; Lord Alexander quietly departed Canada shortly after the announcement of Massey as his successor, leaving Chief Justice Thibaudeau Rinfret as administrator of the government in his place, as Massey was, at the time, in London.

It was originally published as two children's books, The Tarzan Twins by Voland in October 1927, and Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion, by Whitman in March 1936. These were brought together in November 1963 under the title of Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins in the first complete edition. The opening passage of \"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins, with Jad-bal-ja, the Golden Lion\" specifies that its events occur immediately after those of \"The Tarzan Twins.\" In \n\n Tarzan: The Lost Adventure is a novel credited to Edgar Rice Burroughs and American writer Joe R.

In a 1999 The Phantom story, Lord of the Jungle, the hero meets Edgar Rice Burroughs, and inspires him to create Tarzan. In 2012, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc began publishing webcomics on their official website including Tarzan by writer Roy Thomas and artist Tom Grindberg and Tarzan of The Apes by Roy Thomas, artist Pablo Marcos, and colorist/letterer Oscar Gonzales.

Paddle steamers such as the Geneva Cross were used as ambulance steamers. A wilderness first responder is trained to provide pre-hospital care in remote settings who has skills relevant to ad hoc patient packaging and transport by non-motorized means. Even with such preparation, first responders face unique risks of being the first people to aid those with unknown contagions. Trauma\n\nEtymology\n\nThe use of the term “first responder” in the current sense first emerged in the 1970s. Perhaps the earliest uses in print occurred in two articles in the Boston Globe in August 1973 about proposed ambulance regulations in Massachusetts. They included an article in The Daly Sentinel (Grand Junction, CO) in March 1972, and another about the formation of a First Response Group composed of volunteers in the Burlington (VT) Free Press in April 1973.)

The Anglo-American Ambulance has been described as a key means of exchanging medical best practice between the volunteers and the French and Prussian surgeons they worked with. In addition to spreading the word of Lister's pioneering work on antiseptics and widening the use of chloroform and morphine on the battlefield the ambulance helped to popularise a standardised method of treating bullet wounds which was based on Surgeon-General Sir Thomas Longmore's 1863 work with Minié rifle bullet wounds. MacCormac claimed that the adoption of this method was the primary reason for the low mortality rates achieved by the ambulance.\n\nQuestion: In which country were motorized ambulances first used?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Berlin assembly operation produced 1,177 Model Ts in 1926 and a further 2,594 during 1927 which was the Model T's final year: in August 1927 Model T production in Berlin ended, and it was nearly a year before, on 20 August 1928, Ford auto-production in Berlin recommenced, now of the Ford Model A. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years' production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927). The Ford Motor Company of Canada, founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first internal combustion engines built in Canada, at the Windsor plant.

The islands rest on the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge, an oceanic ridge and plateau, and extend 2,550 km north and south across the equator, from latitude 14º N to 8º S. Lakshadweep lies to the north, 300 km west of India's southwest coast. Lakshadweep consists of 36 small islands between 8º - 14º N, with a total land area of 32 km2. The Maldives are the largest island group, with approximately 1190 islands between 7º N and the equator. The Chagos Archipelago lies between 5° and 8° S, and constitute the British Indian Ocean Territory. The Maldives has, in recent years, become one of the epicenters of the climate refugee debate. The Maldives has an average estimated elevation of 1.5 meters above sea-level, with 80 percent of its islands currently resting less than 1 meter above sea-level. The total landmass of the islands is continuously decreasing due to rising sea-levels, and many of the smaller islands are thought to be years away from becoming completely submerged. Climate change has recently become a long-term security issue for the Maldives which, according to numerous climate scientists, could disappear entirely within one or two centuries.

The French king was put under surveillance, and increasingly suspected of conspiring with other European monarchs, who wished to preserve the House of Bourbon in France and restore its pre-revolutionary authority. This was explicitly stated in the Declaration of Pillnitz (17 August 1791) by king Frederick William II of Prussia and emperor Francis II (Austria, Hungary and Bohemia), who called on all monarchs in Europe to 'liberate' \n\n Louis XVII (born Louis Charles, Duke of Normandy; 27 March 1785 – 8 June 1795) was the younger son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. His older brother, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle period of the French Revolution, he automatically succeeded as the king of France, Louis XVII, in the eyes of the royalists. France was by then a republic and since Louis-Charles died in June 1795, he never actually ruled. In a context of civil and international war, Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the Insurrection of 10 August 1792. Louis was then tried by the National Convention (self-instituted as a tribunal for the occasion), found guilty of high treason, \n\n time in his previous palace came to an end on 5 October 1789, when an angry mob of Parisian working men and women was incited by revolutionaries and marched on the Palace of Versailles, where the royal family lived.

It is the language of the Bulgarians. It is the official language of Bulgaria, and since 2007 has been among the official languages of the European Union. In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the European Union. This caused such a scandal that the Veliko Tarnovo University revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the Macedonian language). For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007. People born in Lilkovo speak a Rhodopean dialect of Bulgarian, which is similar to the one spoken in Smolyan. A few examples are shown in the table below:\n\n Pomaks (Помаци; Πομάκοι; Pomaklar) are Bulgarian-speaking Muslims inhabiting Bulgaria, northeastern Greece and mainly northwestern Turkey. The c. 220,000 strong ethno-confessional minority in Bulgaria is known officially as Bulgarian Muslims. They speak various Bulgarian dialects and those spoken in Greece and Turkey are referred to there as the Pomak language. However, in Greece and Turkey the practice for declaring the ethnic group at census has been abolished for decades. Different members of the group today declare a variety of ethnic identities: Bulgarian, Pomak,   ethnic Muslims, Turkish and other.\n\nQuestion: What is the principal language of Bulgaria?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Located in the Central Administrative Okrug, it is one of three Catholic churches in Moscow and the largest in Russia. The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. The style was influenced by Westminster Abbey and Milan \n\n With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911. It is currently the second largest church building in Georgia, after the Holy Trinity Cathedral. The present cross-in-square structure was completed between 1010 and 1029 by the medieval Georgian architect Arsukisdze, although the site itself dates back to the early fourth century. Owing to its historical significance and the adjacent historical buildings, it is regarded as one of the most famous squares in Europe and the world. It is located in Moscow's historic centre, in the eastern walls of the Kremlin.

It is also called the Crusade of the Faint-Hearted due to the number of participants who joined this crusade after having turned back from the First Crusade. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. Some of these people were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; Adela of Blois, wife of Stephen, Count of Blois, who had fled from the siege of Antioch in 1098, was so ashamed of her husband that she would not permit him to stay at home. Latin Christians responded in 1189 by launching the Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus, and Frederick Barbarossa separately. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187, and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July.

Harold marched his army back down to the south coast, where he met William's army, at a place now called Battle just outside Hastings. Harold was killed when he fought and lost the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. An important pitched battle that demonstrated the evolution of tactics and technology during the Middle Ages was the battle of Hastings fought on the 14 October 1066. This battle was fought between the Norman-French Army under William the Conqueror and the English army under Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson.

The Normans under William deployed in three groups which consisted of their origins, Bretons \n\n William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066, defeating the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings and placing the country under Norman rule. Most of the damage done in the invasion was in the north and the west of England, some of it still recorded as \"wasteland\" in 1086. Harold's victory was short-lived. Three days after the battle, on 28 September, a second invasion army led by William, Duke of Normandy, landed in Pevensey Bay, Sussex, on the south coast of England. Harold had to immediately turn his troops around and force-march them southwards to intercept the Norman army. Less than three weeks after Stamford Bridge, on 14 October 1066, the English army was decisively defeated and King Harold II fell in action at the Battle of Hastings, beginning the Norman conquest of England, a process facilitated by the heavy losses amongst the English military commanders.\n\nQuestion: In which battle did Harold II, the last Saxon king, lose his life?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Her second husband was Richard Bertie, a member of her household. Following Charles Brandon's death in 1545, it was rumoured that King Henry had considered marrying Katherine as his seventh wife, while he was still married to his sixth wife, Catherine Parr, who was Katherine's close friend. Catherine Parr (1512–5 September 1548), Queen Consort of England and Ireland, who wedded: ; Sir Edward Burgh, 1529 at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England. ; King Henry VIII, 12 July 1543 at Hampton Court Palace in the private oratory of the Queen's Closet. He married three times, all without issue: ; Anne Bourchier, 7th Baroness Bourchier ; Elizabeth Brooke ; Helena Snakenborg. ; Anne Parr, Countess of Pembroke (c. 1515–20 February 1552), married in 1538, William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, by whom she had two sons and a daughter. The match, though by no means a prize, was acceptable to him as it strengthened his influence \n\n Soon after her return, Mary was married to William Carey, a wealthy and influential courtier, on 4 February 1520; Henry VIII was a guest at the couple's wedding. Henry VIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, had first been married to Henry's elder brother Arthur when he was a little over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died just a few months later. Henry later used this to justify the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress.\n\nQuestion: Which wife of Henry VIII had already married twice before she became queen, and married for a fourth time after Henry's death?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They had the castle erected 35 km southwest of Klettgau, on the Aar, the largest tributary of the High Rhine. The name of \"Habsburg\" was not added to the noble title until Radbot's grandson, Otto II. He added \"von Habsburg\" to his title, thus beginning the House of Habsburg. Habsburg Castle's importance diminished after Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph moved the family's power base to Austria in 1276. Habsburg Castle remained \n\n Laxenburg castles are imperial palaces and castles outside Vienna, in the town of Laxenburg owned in equal parts by Vienna and Lower Austria. The castles became a Habsburg possession in 1333 and formerly served as a summer retreat, along with Schönbrunn palace, for the imperial Habsburg dynasty. Blauer Hof Palace was the birthplace of some members of the royal family, including Crown Prince Rudolf. Another castle nearby is named Franzensburg castle. Today the castles are used for events, conferences, and concerts. After the war, Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III. ordered the demolition of the castle, possibly out of fear for it being an \"unconquerable fort of anti-Habsburg resistance\". Castle palaces, chapel and other parts of the bastion were used as a granary, devaluating the whole complex, yet protecting it from being rebuilt. The original coat of arms to fly over Habsburg Castle, a red lion on a golden field, remained part of the Austrian arms up to the end of the imperial period. The area around the castle was covered by forests that were only cleared around 1500, nearly half a millennium after Habsburg Castle was first constructed.

In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. Napoleon was retreating from his failed invasion of Russia in 1812. Even though the French were victorious in the initial battles during their campaign in Germany, the Coalition armies eventually joined together and defeated them at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813. After the battle, the Pro-French German Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby loosening Napoleon's hold on Germany east of the Rhine. But when the Austrians dawdled rather than taking advantage of their opportunities, the French commander determined to attack his opponent again. Meanwhile, oblivious of the Russian retreat, the French pursued their intended manoeuvre, pushing their advance guard, elements of the Reserve Cavalry Corps of Joachim Murat, supported by Jean-de-Dieu Soult's Corps, towards the Alle river. Seeing an opportunity for a major battle, Napoleon ordered four more army corps to march to the battlefield. He detailed Murat to delay his attack in order to wait for reinforcements and, as soon as these reached the battlefield, attack the Russians frontally using Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond \n\n In 1809, Europe was embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against a series of coalitions in the Coalition Wars almost continuously since 1792. In August 1805, the 200,000-strong French Grande Armée invaded the German states, hoping to defeat Austria before Russian forces could intervene. The Austrian capital, Vienna, was captured in November and a Russo-Austrian army was decisively defeated at the 2 December Battle of Austerlitz.\n\nQuestion: Who were the victors of the Battle of Austerlitz?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Voting last took place in all 650 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom general election on 12 December 2019. The number of seats rose from 646 to 650 at the 2010 general election after proposals made by the boundary commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies) were adopted through statutory instruments. Parliament has two chambers. The House of Representatives has 19 members, 17 members elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies, 2 ex-officio member (President and Speaker). Elections must be held at least every five years but may be called by the prime minister at any time. The Parliament of the United Kingdom (at the Palace of Westminster) legislates on matters such as taxation, foreign policy, defence, employment and trade. For elections to the House of Commons of this parliament, the city area is divided among five United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies, with each constituency returning one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, members of the House elected at a by-election must be formally \"introduced\" to the House. (Members elected at a general election are not introduced.) The ceremony in the Commons is considerably simpler than those in the House of Lords. It has 41 members, each elected to represent single-seat constituencies. Five constituencies were added in the 2007 election; there were only 36 constituencies prior to 2007. This has implications for the calculation of special majority votes (42 members instead of 41).\n\nQuestion: In which parliament has the UK 87 seats for members who are elected for a five0-year term?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It then changed its name to the more descriptive Ecology Party in 1975, and to the Green Party ten years later. After joining the Ecology Party in 1977 (later becoming the Green Party of England and Wales), Lambert has held numerous positions, including Co-Chair of the Party Council (1982–85), Principal Speaker (1992–93 and 1998–99), Chair of the Party Executive (1993–94), Representative to the Federation of European Green Parties (1987–89 and 1998–99) and Political Liaison to the Green Group in the European Parliament (1989–92). As a Member of the European Parliament, she is or has been a member \n\n The Green Party fielded more than 300 candidates for the 2010 general election. In May 2014, Molly Scott Cato became the party's third MEP. The early and mid-1990s were difficult for the Greens, because of Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system, the recession of 1992–93 and the squeeze caused by the rising popularity of New Labour. The Green Party argued that this made him the first Green representative in the House of Commons. The Green Party were the official opposition on Norwich City Council; they formed part of the ruling coalition that controlled Lancaster City Council alongside the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and shared control of Castle Morpeth Council as part of an all party administration. In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the House of Lords, the (unelected) upper chamber of Parliament: in the person of Lord Beaumont of Whitley, who died in 2008.

Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill had taken the lead in calling for British re-armament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. As prime minister, he oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers. Churchill is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism, though some wartime events like the 1945 bombing of Dresden have generated controversy. Winston Churchill, who had long warned against Nazi Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after his predecessor Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the German invasion of Norway in April 1940.

Plurality voting is used for local and/or national elections in 43 of the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations. That makes plurality voting among the simplest of all electoral systems for voters and vote counting officials. (However, the drawing of district boundary lines can be very contentious in the plurality system.) In an election for a legislative body with single-member seats, each voter in a geographically-defined electoral district may vote for one candidate from a list \n\n in the United States, the lower house (Lok Sabha) in India, elections to the British House of Commons and English local elections in the United Kingdom, France (run-off election) and federal and provincial elections in Canada (although prior to 1956 three provinces used ranked voting in provincial elections). Both plurality and majoritarian systems may use single-member or multi-member constituencies. In some votes, the winning candidate or proposition may have only a plurality, depending on the rules of the organization holding the vote. Plurality voting is an electoral system in which a candidate, or candidates, who poll more than any other counterpart (that is, receive a plurality), are elected. In a system based on multi-seat districts, it elects multiple candidates in a district and may be referred to as winner-takes-all, bloc voting or plurality block voting.\n\nQuestion: \"What is the more common name of the \"\"simple plurality\"\" system of voting?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The tu is used in a disparaging way for Louis-Napoléon. It would be unthinkable that anybody should address the Emperor of the French in such a way. This form of address may denote familiarity between friends, but this is not Hugo's intention and it is used purely to belittle a futile leader. It is said that Napoleon III read the work thoroughly and kept a copy by his bedside. He is said to have been so devastated by Hugo's vicious condemnation that he never fully recovered from the shock of his first reading. His father was originally a follower of the Corsican patriot leader, Pasquale Paoli, but later became a supporter of French rule. Bonaparte trained as a lawyer. In that role and as a politician and diplomat, he served in the Cinq-Cents and as the French ambassador to Rome. In 1795 Bonaparte was a member of the Council of Ancients. Some British government officials felt that Louis Bonaparte was seeking foreign adventure in the spirit of his uncle, Napoleon I. Consequently, these officials felt that any close association with Bonaparte would eventually lead Britain into another series of wars, like the wars with France and Napoleon dating from 1793 until 1815. Most Bonapartists were nevertheless conservative, emphasising that the foundation of society was the family, religion and property, and the people should respect the social authorities. The effect was to cause some confusion between the Bonapartist and monarchist (legitimist or Orléanist) groups, who sometimes worked together to avoid splitting the vote in elections. In other cases they were bitter enemies.\n\nQuestion: What word for unthinking patriotism is derived from the name of one of Napoleon's admirers?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment. Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. The development of viable steam engines by Boulton and Watt from 1781 led to the growth of larger, steam-powered mills allowing them to be concentrated in urban mill towns, like Manchester, which with neighbouring Salford had more than 50 mills by 1802. The mechanisation of the spinning process in the early factories was instrumental in the growth of the machine tool industry, \n\n Symington quickly saw a way to marry the efficiency of the Watt engine with the simplicity of that devised by Thomas Newcomen. Encouraged by Gilbert Meason, Symington demonstrated the practicality of his idea and his improved atmospheric engine was patented in 1787. When Watt sent someone to make a sketch of how this new engine worked, he discovered that the steam was condensed under a second piston and this was then pushed down when fresh steam entered the cylinder, forcing out the condensate. However, the first successful designs have been attributed to Atherton; a Warrington machine builder who helped Sir Richard Arkwright whilst in his late twenties.\n\nQuestion: Which builder of steam engines formed a successful partnership with Matthew Boulton?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Piaf's music was often autobiographical, and she specialized in chanson and torch ballads about love, loss and sorrow. Her most widely known songs include \"La Vie en rose\" (1946), \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (1960), \"Hymne à l'amour\" (1949), \"Milord\" (1959), \"La Foule\" (1957), \"L'Accordéoniste\" (1940), and \"Padam, padam...\" (1951). According to journalist Jean Noli, in his book Édith (Éditions Stock 1973), when Charles Dumont and Michel Vaucaire visited Piaf's home at Boulevard Lannes in Paris, on 24 October 1960, she received them in a very impolite and unfriendly manner. Dumont had several times tried to offer Piaf his compositions, but she disliked them and had refused them – the standard was too low, according to her. asked Piaf in a sharp voice. Vaucaire, delighted, replied, \"Of course, Édith, the song is yours\". Piaf dedicated \n\n He wrote songs until the 1960s, sometimes under an alias, for Dalida, Gloria Lasso, Luis Mariano and Tino Rossi. That led to more than 30 songs for her, such as Flonflons du Bal, Mon Dieu and Les Amants which Piaf and Dumont wrote and sang together in 1962. Dumont tells in the book Édith Piaf, Opinions publiques, by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the popular French singer Rosalie Dubois. But, \n\n Despite numerous biographies, much of the truth of Piaf's life is unknown. She was born Édith Giovanna Gassion in Belleville, Paris. Legend has it that she was born on the pavement of Rue de Belleville 72, but her birth certificate says that she was born on 19 December 1915 at the Hôpital Tenon, a hospital located in the 20th arrondissement. She was named Édith after the World War I British nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed 2 months before Édith's birth for helping French soldiers escape from German captivity. Piaf – slang for \"sparrow\" – was a nickname she received 20 years later.

The Coldry Process is applied to brown coal (lignite) with a typical moisture content of 60 per cent by weight and transforms the coal into a densified coal product of equal or better calorific value (5,800 kcal/kg) to typical export quality black coal, with less ash and sulfur content. Black coal equivalent derived from brown coal is ostensibly a 'cleaner' burning coal fuel than most black coals. Anthracite coal is a natural mineral with a high carbon and energy content that gives off light and heat (produced energy) when burned, making it useful as a fuel. It was possibly first used in Pennsylvania as a fuel in 1769, but its real history begins with a documented discovery near Summit Hill and the founding of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company \n\n Densified coal is the product of the Coldry Process coal upgrading technology that removes moisture from low-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite/brown coal. Densified coal resulting from the Coldry Process is regarded as a black coal equivalent or replacement for black coal.

Flat glass has a higher magnesium oxide and sodium oxide content than container glass, and a lower silica, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide content. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are \"silicate glasses\" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass.

Soda–lime glass accounts for about 90% of manufactured glass. It is used in preference to chemically-pure silica, which is silicon dioxide (SiO2), otherwise known as fused quartz. Whereas pure silica has excellent resistance \n\n Borosilicate glass is created by combining and melting boric oxide, silica sand, soda ash, and alumina. In addition to quartz, sodium carbonate, and aluminium oxide traditionally used in glassmaking, boron is used in the manufacture of borosilicate glass. Though more difficult to make than traditional glass due to its high melting temperature, it is economical to produce. Refining is the removal of bubbles from the molten glass. Alternatively the term \"Fining\" is used, in this case, \"refining\" refers to the chemical processes only. Refining is supported by high temperature and stirring, as well as chemical reactions caused by refining agents.

Burgundy truffles (truffe de Bourgogne; tartufo nero di Fragno or scorzone, \"bark\"; trufa de verano; svart sommartryffel), have a hazelnut-like aroma and are prized for their gastronomic qualities. They are used in the haute cuisine of France and Italy, sometimes as a less expensive, milder substitute for the Périgord black truffle (T. melanosporum) when the latter are not available. Like other truffles, they are also packaged for export. With bodies (ascocarps) from 2 to 10 cm in diameter, burgundy truffles are relatively large. They have a wider distribution than any other truffle species. The central object of the film is the Alba truffle, or tartufo blanco, a highly-prized culinary delicacy found primarily in the densely-forested hills of Piedmont. To find the truffles, seasoned hunters, most of whom in the film are in their 80s, search the woods with their dogs, whose olfactory powers detect the truffles growing underground. After a successful hunt, the truffles are smelled and sampled by gourmet buyers who in turn sell them to high-end restaurants around the world.

Certain types of pectins are particularly abundant in the middle lamella, which is the region that cements adjacent cell walls together. Overall, the formation of plant primary cell walls involves the complex interplay between polysaccharides, including cellulose and pectins, and proteins. This combination of components provides strength, flexibility, and the ability to remodel the cell wall as necessary during plant growth. the network of cellulose and cross-linking glycans provides tensile strength, while the pectin network resists compression. Cellulose, cross-linking glycans, and pectin are typically present in roughly equal amounts in a primary cell wall. the middle lamella is especially rich in pectin, and it cements adjacent cells together. Once a plant cell has left the meristem where it is generated, it can grow dramatically, commonly by more than a thousand times in volume. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both.Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils that they deposit in the wall (Figure 19–64). In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units. It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules. Further components of secondary walls of plants are cross-linked phenolic polymers called lignin, which are responsible for mechanical strengthening of the wall. In seagrasses, this polymer has also been detected, but often in lower amounts compared to angiosperm land plants. Thus, the cell walls of seagrasses seem to contain combinations of features known from both angiosperm land plants and marine macroalgae together with new structural elements. Cellulose plays a critical role in providing tensile strength to the primary cell wall, which contributes to the overall strength and resilience of plant cells. The primary cell wall enables plant cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the internal hydrostatic pressure that pushes outward on the cell wall. This pressure is vital for cell expansion during growth and provides mechanical rigidity to plant tissues. Cellulose, being a strong and rigid polysaccharide, provides the primary cell wall with its mechanical strength. This allows plant cells to sustain their internal pressure and prevents them from collapsing or losing their shape. Furthermore, the presence of cellulose in the primary cell wall contributes to the resilience of plant cells. When a plant cell is subjected to mechanical stress, cellulose provides resistance and helps maintain the integrity of the cell wall. In summary, cellulose plays a crucial role in the primary cell wall of plants by providing tensile strength and contributing to the overall strength, resilience, and plasticity of plant cells. Its presence allows plant cells to develop turgor pressure, sustain internal hydrostatic pressure, and maintain their structural integrity even under mechanical stress.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the strong material found in plant cell walls?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase. Since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature, evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures. As the faster-moving molecules escape, the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy, and the temperature of the liquid decreases. This phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling. For example, laundry on a clothes line will dry (by evaporation) more rapidly \n\n In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, “impassable”) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient \"adiabatic approximation\". There, the process becomes a pseudo-adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because a compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated. Condensation (gas to liquid) ΔH<0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat. ; Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH>0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools). The process is thus: Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2 °C) heating or cooling in buildings.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the change of state from liquid to gas?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Addition belongs to arithmetic, a branch of mathematics. Addition has several important properties. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, \n\nAn order: each number is either less or more than any other number. ; Algebraic structure: there are operations of multiplication and addition that make it into a field. ; A geometry: it is equipped with a metric and is flat. ; A topology: there is a notion of open sets. Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach sequences to others. Advances in the numeral system and mathematical notation eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be stated formally, and even proven. See, for example, Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.\n\nQuestion: Which branch of science has four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By considering these factors, we can better understand and predict the frictional forces between objects. When contacting surfaces move relative to each other, the friction between the two objects converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, or heat. Friction between solid objects is often referred to as dry friction or sliding friction and between a solid and a gas or liquid as fluid friction. Both of these types of friction are called kinetic friction. Surface roughness and contact area, however, do affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces. support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's third law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced. To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:  Forces F1 and F2 are equal due of Newton's third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4. It is not solely caused by surface roughness, although surface roughness and contact area can affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces. Sliding friction occurs when two contacting surfaces move relative to each other, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy or heat.

These sugars are the basis of the plant's nourishment – the sole source of the carbohydrates needed for growth \n\n extended spectral regions, such as the near-infrared. Chlorophyll, the most abundant plant pigment, is most efficient in capturing red and blue light. Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. An exception to the predominance of chlorophyll is autumn, when chlorophyll is degraded (because it contains N and Mg) but the accessory pigments \n\nThe chloroplast is a specialized organelle found in plant cells that plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis.

The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, \"blue-green algae\",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light.

It is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of algae and plants. This selective absorption of light is why chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green.

In this stage, chlorophyll helps convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) through a series of chemical reactions. Overall, chlorophyll's ability to absorb light energy and transfer it to other molecules allows plants to carry out photosynthesis efficiently.

Issues include funding for research and educational programs, government regulations and permits for research activities, decision-making in habitat and biodiversity management, the impacts of birds on fisheries, in agriculture and in urban areas, threatened species, the role of birds in ecosystems, and standards concerning the use and maintenance of live birds in research. The Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds was written by the English naturalist and army officer George Montagu, and first published by J. It was one of the texts, along with Thomas Bewick's contemporaneous A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The first edition was admired by biologists including Charles Darwin and David Lack. His work on the classification of birds based on anatomical and morphological characters was influential and made use of by Alexander Wetmore in his classification of North American birds. After graduation he travelled to the Natural History Museum in London in 1880 at the request of Albert Günther, to work on the museum's Catalogue of Birds. Gadow also established the first new sequence of \n\n George Montagu's introduction, \"in hopes of advancing knowledge of the subject\", mentions Thomas Pennant as being \"diffuse on the subject\" of ornithology, as well as Dr. Latham's General Synopsis of Birds and his Index Ornithologicus. He then introduces the anatomy of birds, separating those with a cartilaginous stomach or gizzard, and those with a membranous stomach; those that incubate their young, and the cuckoo that does not; with remarks on instincts such as carrying shell fragments away from the nest, birdsong, and feet adapted for different purposes, such as climbing or swimming. Feathers are epidermal growths that form a distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on dinosaurs, both avian (bird) and some non-avian (non-bird) and possibly other archosauromorphs. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, and waterproofing. Plumology (or plumage science) is the name for the science that is associated with the study of feathers.\n\nQuestion: What id the name given to the study of birds?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Throughout the world, many of the Phaeophyceae class brown seaweeds are harvested to be processed and converted into sodium alginate. Brown seaweeds range in size from the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera which can be 20–40 meters long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2–4 m long, to smaller species 30–60 cm long. Most brown seaweed used for alginates are gathered from the wild, with the exception of Laminaria japonica, which is cultivated in China for food and its surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China. Alginates from different species of brown seaweed vary in their chemical structure resulting in \n\n Brown algae include a number of edible seaweeds. Microalgae, also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae, constitute the majority of cultivated algae. Macroalgae commonly known as seaweed also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild. Global production of farmed aquatic plants, overwhelmingly dominated by seaweeds, grew in output volume from 13.5 million tonnes in 1995 to just over 30 million tonnes in 2016. Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of Macrocystis are harvested annually in New Mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed. The brown algae (singular: alga), comprising the class Phaeophyceae, are a large group of multicellular algae, including many seaweeds located in colder waters within the Northern Hemisphere. Another example is Sargassum, which creates unique floating mats of seaweed in the tropical waters of the Sargasso Sea that serve as the habitats for many species. Many brown algae, such as members of the order Fucales, commonly grow along rocky seashores. Some members of the class, such as kelps, are used by humans as food.\n\nQuestion: What type of seaweed grows up to 100 meters in length, and is farmed for its alginates?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Myoglobin is distantly related to hemoglobin. Compared to hemoglobin, myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and does not have cooperative binding with oxygen like hemoglobin does. In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury. High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allow organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time. Diving mammals such as whales and seals have muscles with particularly high abundance of myoglobin. Myoglobin is found in Type I muscle, Type II A, and Type II B, but most texts consider myoglobin not to be found in smooth muscle.

Hemoproteins\nHuman proteins\n\nMyoglobin (Mb) plays a significant role in terms of protein structure and oxygen storage. It is a small, globular protein primarily responsible for storing oxygen in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. In terms of protein structure, early studies on myoglobin were important milestones in the field of protein structure determination. In terms of its role in oxygen storage, myoglobin helps regulate cellular oxygen tension in respiring tissues. This further highlights the physiological significance of myoglobin beyond its role in oxygen storage. It's worth mentioning that recent research involving myoglobin has included the development of assays for serum myoglobin detection and additives to preserve the red coloring of fresh meat. The study of myoglobin has also extended to non-muscle tissues of fish species and mammalian cancer cells, suggesting its potential involvement in other biological processes. Overall, myoglobin's significance lies in its role as an oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue and its contribution to regulating cellular oxygen tension and the bioavailability of nitric oxide. One characteristic that differentiates hemoglobin from myoglobin is their respective functions in the body. Hemoglobin is primarily responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, while myoglobin is mainly involved in storing and releasing oxygen within the muscle cells. Additionally, the structure of hemoglobin and myoglobin also differs. In contrast, myoglobin is a monomer, meaning it is composed of a single protein subunit with a heme group. This characteristic makes myoglobin better suited for oxygen storage in the muscle cells. In summary, the main characteristics that differentiate hemoglobin from myoglobin include their functions, structure, and their respective binding affinity for oxygen. Hemoglobin is involved in oxygen transport, consists of four protein subunits, and exhibits cooperative binding, while myoglobin plays a role in oxygen storage, is a single protein subunit, and has a higher oxygen affinity without cooperative binding. The physiological role of hemoglobin and myoglobin in the body is primarily related to their ability to bind molecular oxygen. On the other hand, myoglobin is a monomeric protein mainly found in muscle tissue and serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen. Both hemoglobin and myoglobin have a heme group, which contains iron that binds to oxygen. Each myoglobin molecule contains a single heme group inserted into a hydrophobic cleft in the protein. In summary, hemoglobin and myoglobin play crucial roles in oxygen transport and storage in the body. Hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout the body, while myoglobin stores oxygen within muscle tissue. Both proteins rely on their heme groups, which bind and release oxygen as needed.

They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Unlike plant cells, animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. The body tissues are composed of numerous types \n\n Wood, an organic material produced by plants, are chemically composed of: carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin and other components (aliphatic acids, alcohols, proteins and inorganic substances) in a smaller amount. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose. Hemicellulose represents the second most important carbohydrate with accounts 20% to 30% of the wood's cell. These functions are important in various animal species to facilitate the digestion process. Ruminant mammals, like cows, have a unique digestive system. They are often said to have four \"stomachs,\" but the first three chambers (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) are actually derived from the esophagus. Microbes in the rumen and reticulum break down protein, starch, fats, and even cellulose. The products of microbial action, along with some of the microbes themselves, move into the cow's true stomach and intestine for further digestion and absorption. This symbiotic relationship with microbes allows ruminants to digest cellulose, a component of their herbivorous diet that they cannot digest on their own. In summary, the stomach plays crucial roles in initiating digestion, converting food into a semi-liquid mixture (chyme), and releasing it into the small intestine. This process is adapted to the specific needs of different animal species, such as birds and ruminants, allowing them to efficiently digest their food and obtain nutrients from it. Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fiber such as cellulose. in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that hydrolyze cellulose. Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include certain starches, fiber, oligosaccharides, and sugars that the body failed to digest and absorb like lactose in the case of lactose intolerance and sugar alcohols, mucus produced by the gut, and proteins. Bacteria turn carbohydrates they ferment into short-chain fatty acids by a form of fermentation called saccharolytic fermentation.\n\nQuestion: What is the most abundant substance in the plant kingdom, which no mammal produces the enzyme to digest?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called \"soldier\" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their \"duties\" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation in the size \n\n Though all castes defend their nests in the event of invasion, a true soldier caste, with individuals called majors, exists. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. The army ants of South America, such as the Eciton burchellii species, and the driver ants of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest (bivouac) from their own bodies, by holding each other \n\n Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups.\n\nQuestion: Which family of insects has species named 'drivers', 'weavers', 'and even individuals called 'soldiers'?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Unlike classical ethology, which focuses on the evolutionary, functional, mechanistic, and developmental aspects of behavior, phenomenology explores the mental processes and subjective experiences of animals. This approach encompasses empirical observations that offer preliminary insights into the behavior pattern, such as carrying the tail in mice. Animals used in research can experience several advantages, including improved veterinary care, advancements in disease prevention and treatment, and conservation efforts. By studying animals and their physiological responses to various treatments, scientists can enhance medical knowledge and develop better treatments for veterinary purposes. By studying animals in their natural habitats and in controlled environments, researchers gain insights into their behaviors, life cycles, and the ecological systems they depend on. This information aids in the development of conservation plans, habitat management strategies, and species recovery programs, ultimately benefiting the animals themselves. In conclusion, animals used in scientific research can experience several potential benefits, including improved veterinary care, advancements in disease prevention and treatment, and contributions to conservation efforts. Anthrozoology (also known as \"human–animal studies\") is the study of interaction between living things. It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions. It includes scholars from a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, biology, and philosophy. Ethologists were accustomed to studying animal behavior, which often involved direct observation and experimentation. However, studying human behavior posed different challenges. Unlike animals in controlled laboratory settings, studying humans required access to natural environments such as kindergartens, schools, and communities. This was particularly important to ensure that the behavior being studied was a true representation of natural human behavior. Another challenge was the conceptual shift from studying animal behavior to studying human behavior. Ethologists had to adapt their knowledge and methodologies to the unique characteristics of human behavior. Studying human behavior raised questions about privacy, informed consent, and the ethical treatment of human subjects. Overall, the challenges faced by human ethologists in the 1960s and 1970s included developing appropriate methodologies for studying human behavior in natural settings, adapting to the unique characteristics of human behavior, and navigating the ethical considerations surrounding the study of human subjects.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the study of animal behavior?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ultrastructure of stomata in these mosses is highly similar to each other, and less variable compared to tracheophytes (vascular plants). However, there are some subtle differences between the two moss species. Oedipodium sporophytes have extensive spongy tissue along the apophysis, while Ephemerum has minimal substomatal cavities. Additionally, the sporophytes of both mosses are covered by a cuticle that is thicker on the guard cells and extends along the walls surrounding the pore. These anatomical features in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses support the role of stomata in gas exchange and water transport during development and maturation. Overall, while there are some differences in specific anatomical features, the ultrastructure of stomata in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses is remarkably similar, highlighting the importance of stomata in land plants for gas exchange, water transport, and potentially spore dispersal. along with the species' exceptional height, it becomes clear that common haircap moss is quite a unique moss considering that the majority of species show little differentiation of conducting tissue and are restricted to much smaller stem lengths. Most mosses simply have a single plate of cells on the leaf surface, but common haircap moss has more highly differentiated photosynthetic tissue. The first plants were aquatic, as described in the page Evolutionary history of plants, and released sperm freely into the water to be carried with the currents. Primitive land plants like liverworts and mosses had motile sperm that swam in a thin film of water or were splashed in water droplets from the male reproduction organs onto the female organs. Bryophytes are non-vascular plants encompassing mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, which most often form symbioses with members from the cyanobacterial genus Nostoc. In mosses, cyanobacteria are major nitrogen fixers and grow mostly epiphytically, aside from two species of Sphagnum which protect the cyanobiont from an acidic-bog environment. In terrestrial Arctic environments, cyanobionts are the primary supplier of nitrogen to the ecosystem whether free-living or epiphytic with mosses. Cyanobacterial associations with liverworts are rare, with only four of 340 genera of liverworts harbouring symbionts. Two of the genera, Marchantia and Porella, are epiphytic, while the genera Blasia and Cavicularia are endophytic.\n\nQuestion: Mosses are classified as belonging to which part of the plant kingdom?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Most are rather dull olive-brown to gray and several have a pale and dark stripe on their side, however a few are very colorful. The Pallas's squirrel may have an unremarkable olive-gray back, while its belly is often –but not always– bright red. They are solitary, and give birth to one to five young. Their food consists of nuts, fruits, and seeds, and also of insects and bird eggs. The mountain ground squirrel (Geosciurus princeps) is a rodent that is native to southwestern Angola, western Namibia, and western South Africa. It is the closest relative of the Cape ground squirrel (Latin name Geosciurus inauris), which is so similar in appearance that the two are difficult to distinguish in the field. Both species have long bushy black and white tails with a white stripe from the shoulder towards the rump. Geosciurus princeps is slightly larger, on average, than G. inauris, although there is considerable overlap in body size. Differences in skull morphology also distinguish the two species, and the incisors are yellow to orange rather than white as in G. inauris. The mountain ground squirrel is a large-bodied squirrel with small ears. The tail is long and typically very bushy. Nesting mothers will use their tail hair to line birthing nests. Western gray squirrels eat berries, nuts, a variety of seeds, and the eggs of small birds. The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America and an introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America.

In the last couple of decades, developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in structural units to serve a common function compose organs. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. Connective tissues are fibreous tissues. They are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found in the heart where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism. The epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces such as the surface of skin, the airways, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss. Epithelial tissues help in elimination of waste. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ. Lateral Meristem - This meristem consist of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth. Intercalary Meristem - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. Parenchyma (para - 'beside'; enchyma - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Some of parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fibre also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma , succulent parenchyma also noted. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. This type of tissues are mainly of two divisions: 1) Sclerenchyma fiber and 2) Sclereids. Schlerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long and narrow and unicellular. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. Xylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids ends overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. \"A history of the development of histology up to the end of the nineteenth century\". Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. The phycoplast is a microtubule structure observed during cytokinesis in members of the Chlorophytina, the largest and most well known subphylum of chlorophyte green algae. use structures called phragmoplasts to organize and guide the growing cell plate. In these plants, the microtubules of the telophase spindle give rise to the phragmoplast and are oriented perpendicular to the plane of cell division and the forming cell plate. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments.\n\nQuestion: What has a central vein called a midrib?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Some plants have the capability of  absorbing  pollutants \n\n agents in the model. It is an annual growth plant that absorbs nutrients from the soil and reproduces through root tubers and rhizomes. Reproduction of the plant is not impacted by water flow, but can be influenced by animals, other plants, and humans. The plant can grow up to two meters tall, which is a limiting condition because it can only grow in certain water depths, and most of its biomass is found at the top of the plant in order to capture the most sunlight possible.

Not to be confused with seaweed, plant-like algae, or with beachgrass, a terrestrial plant. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons). The name seagrass stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow by rhizome extension and often spread across large \"meadows\" resembling grassland; many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae. Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. Seaweeds are multicellular marine algae and, although their ecological impact is similar to other larger water plants, they are not typically referred to as macrophytes. The most common adaptation is the presence of lightweight internal packing cells, aerenchyma, but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are also common. Aquatic plants can only grow in water or in soil that is frequently saturated with water.

If the tooth has yet to erupt by an appropriate age, panoramic x-rays are taken. A fully grown up adult will have 32 teeth in mouth, 8 teeth in each quarter of a mouth. The last ones to erupt are the four molars, one in each quarter, known as ‘wisdom tooth’. When the wisdom teeth start erupting, often there is short of space. This space crunch therefore does impede their full growth (eruption) into the mouth. Lower wisdom teeth are very commonly infected. Such infections give symptoms such as swelling over the back part of the jaw, inability to open the mouth (trismus), pain especially to bite on the area, a bad taste, and bad breath. Since wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt, they often create space by pushing other teeth in line when they finally emerge. In some cases, wisdom teeth come through the gums only partially or not at all (impaction). In some cases, wisdom teeth emerge normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms. A tooth that only partially erupts creates an opening for bacteria to create an infection (pericoronitis), leading to tenderness or swelling around the gums, jaw stiffness and general illness. Wisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth. The listed dentists of India Dental Clinic would rather first adopt a conservative dental treatment approach of just monitoring the eruption progress of wisdom teeth of both upper and lower jaw. Many dentists believe that impacted wisdom teeth are almost certain to cause problems at some point, and recommend surgical extraction regardless of whether or not the patient is experiencing symptoms. Upper wisdom teeth are usually very straightforward to remove unless badly decayed. However, there are rare instances when a sinus perforation will not heal and a fistula develops that represents a communication between your mouth and sinus cavity. Fistula develops early on as a birth defect (associated with a cleft palate). It is also faced as a complication of removing a tooth, or from infection or trauma. Sometimes the roots of a tooth are so close to the bone under a maxillary sinus that the bone is damaged when the tooth is removed. However, careful oral hygiene such as regular brushing and flossing can help reduce the risk of tooth decay, infection or other complications. The primary (baby) teeth generally start coming in by 6 months of age, and all 20 teeth may be in by two and a half years of age. There may be an incomplete formation of the enamel on the teeth (enamel hypoplasia) that makes the teeth more vulnerable to caries (cavities). There may be missing teeth eruptions. If the infant is not closing down properly, the lower jaws become more noticeably deficient (micrognathia or retrognathia). The front teeth may not touch when the child closes down because the back teeth have overerrupted or because of incomplete formation of the maxilla. This condition is called an anterior open bite and has facial/skeletal implications. Hypodontia is defined as the developmental absence of one or more teeth excluding the third molars. It is one of the most common dental anomalies and has a negative impact on both looks and function. It rarely occurs in primary teeth (also known as deciduous, milk, first and baby teeth) and the most commonly affected are the adult second premolars and the upper lateral incisors. The phenomenon can be subdivided into the following according to the number of teeth concerned: 1. Hypodontia: one to six missing teeth excluding the third molars 2. Oligodontia: six or more missing permanent teeth excluding the third molars 3. Anodontia: complete absence of teeth\n\nYour third molars, commonly known as your wisdom teeth, are typically the last teeth to erupt in your mouth. If healthy and functional your wisdom teeth can be useful. In other cases, your wisdom teeth can become impacted or only partially erupt through the gum in a misalignment. When impacted or partially impacted, your wisdom teeth can cause swelling, pain and even infection of the surrounding gum. They can also put pressure on the adjacent teeth, which can result in permanent damage to these otherwise healthy teeth and their surrounding bone. Sometimes, impacted or partially impacted wisdom teeth can also lead to the formation of cysts, and in worse case scenarios even tumors, which could potentially destroy an entire section of your jaw. Whether your dentist or a specialist is performing the extraction the procedure is the same. A dental instrument called an elevator is used to wiggle the tooth in its socket. There is no single right answer for everyone; however, if your dentist has advised you that your wisdom teeth look potentially problematic it’s generally best to remove them sooner rather than later. The likeliness of lingering numbness, jaw fracture or other complications also increases with age. Lastly, the longer you leave a troublesome wisdom tooth in your mouth, the longer it has to cause further problems in the future.\n\nQuestion: Which teeth are the third molars, and are always the last to0 erupt?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The pancreas plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal or due to glycogen conversion, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream. On the other hand, glucagon, which is released by alpha cells in the pancreas, has the opposite effect of raising blood sugar levels. Many tissues monitor the levels of glucose in the blood, but pancreatic islet cells are particularly important in this process. When blood glucose levels deviate from the desired range, the pancreas adjusts insulin and glucagon secretion accordingly to restore balance. In summary, blood sugar levels are regulated through a complex interplay of hormones, primarily insulin and glucagon, secreted by the pancreas. This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood. Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. The absence of sufficient insulin causes this breaking-down process to be accelerated; it is the mechanism behind metabolizing fat instead of glucose and the appearance of ketones. Such downregulation underlies insulin resistance, which is common in type 2 diabetes. The insulin oscillations are generated by pulsatile release of the hormone from the pancreas. Since each islet contains up to 2000 beta cells and there are one million islets in the pancreas it is apparent that pulsatile secretion requires sophisticated synchronization both within and among the islets of Langerhans. This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood. The levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the pancreatic islets are among the most well understood and important. Glucagon\nIf the blood glucose level falls to dangerously low levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon, a hormone which travels through the blood to  the liver, where it binds to glucagon receptors on the surface of liver cells and stimulates them to break down glycogen stored inside the cells into glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis). It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. Insulin\nWhen levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of glycogen conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from beta cells found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This hormone, insulin, causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called glycogenesis), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily muscle and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the GLUT4 transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. Hormones that influence blood glucose level\n\nReferences \n\nDiabetes\nMedical conditions related to obesity\nNutrition\nEndocrinology\n\nQuestion: What is secreted by the pancreas to regulate blood sugar levels?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They form a shallow groove at the line of their junction, which form the atrioventricular groove. The atrioventricular groove hosts major coronary arteries while they travel along to the line of attachment of atrioventricular valves. The right and left ventricles are separated by a septum, which corresponds to the interventricular grooves that travel from the [[posterior to the anterior surface of the heart. The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system. The left and right sides of the heart have different functions: the right side receives blood coming from the body through the superior and inferior venae cavae and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, while the left side receives saturated blood from the lungs. The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest. In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Structure\n\nLocation and shape\n\nThe human heart is situated in the mediastinum, at the level of thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The back surface of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels—the venae cavae, aorta and pulmonary trunk. The largest part of the heart is usually slightly offset to the left side of the chest (though occasionally it may be offset to the right) and is felt to be on the left because the left heart is stronger and larger, since it pumps to all body parts. Because the heart is between the lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12 oz). The heart is often described as the size of a fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness, although this description is disputed, as the heart is likely to be slightly larger. Chambers\n\nThe heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus. The fibrous cardiac skeleton gives structure to the heart. It forms the atrioventricular septum, which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings, which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart's electrical conduction system since collagen cannot conduct electricity. The interatrial septum separates the atria, and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract. Valves\n\nThe heart has four valves, which separate its chambers. One valve lies between each atrium and ventricle, and one valve rests at the exit of each ventricle. The valves between the atria and ventricles are called the atrioventricular valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when they close. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. Two additional semilunar valves sit at the exit of each of the ventricles. When the ventricle relaxes blood flows back into the ventricle from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta. Right heart\n\nThe right heart consists of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the tricuspid valve. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The right atrium is connected to the right ventricle by the tricuspid valve. The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. It arises from the lower part of the interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. Left heart\n\nThe left heart has two chambers: the left atrium and the left ventricle, separated by the mitral valve. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood back from the lungs via one of the four pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve. The left ventricle is much thicker as compared with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The left ventricle pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart muscle; the left coronary artery is above the left cusp of the valve,  and the right coronary artery is above the right cusp. Wall\n\nThe heart wall is made up of three layers: the inner endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the pericardium. The innermost layer of the heart is called the endocardium. It is made up of a lining of simple squamous epithelium and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively. There are two types of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to contract easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The tough outer surface of the pericardium is called the fibrous membrane. This is lined by a double inner membrane called the serous membrane that produces pericardial fluid to lubricate the surface of the heart. The part of the serous membrane attached to the fibrous membrane is called the parietal pericardium, while the part of the serous membrane attached to the heart is known as the visceral pericardium. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. It does this by branching into smaller arteries—diagonal and septal branches. The left circumflex supplies the back and underneath of the left ventricle. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining the back of the left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, as well as to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Development\n\nThe heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into embryogenesis. The heart derives from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the cardiogenic region. Between the third and fourth week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the formation of the septa and the valves and the remodeling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week, the septa are complete, and by the ninth week, the heart valves are complete. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale was, called the fossa ovalis. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs. The right heart collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. In the left heart, oxygenated blood is returned to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Cardiac cycle\n\nThe cardiac cycle refers to the sequence of events in which the heart contracts and relaxes with every heartbeat. The period of time during which the ventricles contract, forcing blood out into the aorta and main pulmonary artery, is known as systole, while the period during which the ventricles relax and refill with blood is known as diastole. The atria and ventricles work in concert, so in systole when the ventricles are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the ventricles are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the ventricles. This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body. At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, the ventricles are relaxing. As they do so, they are filled by blood passing through the open mitral and tricuspid valves. After the ventricles have completed most of their filling, the atria contract, forcing further blood into the ventricles and priming the pump. Next, the ventricles start to contract. As the pressure rises within the cavities of the ventricles, the mitral and tricuspid valves are forced shut. As the pressure within the ventricles rises further, exceeding the pressure with the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves open. Simultaneously, the atria refill as blood flows into the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Finally, when the pressure within the ventricles falls below the pressure within the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves close. The ventricles start to relax, the mitral and tricuspid valves open, and the cycle begins again. The cardiac output is normalized to body size through body surface area and is called the cardiac index. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill: if the ventricles contract more frequently, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched. Afterload, or how much pressure the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by narrowing of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels. Here an electrical signal is created that travels through the heart, causing the heart muscle to contract. The sinoatrial node is found in the upper part of the right atrium near to the junction with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this by creating an action potential. When the sinoatrial cells are resting, they have a negative charge on their membranes. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. Heart failure is the end result of many diseases affecting the heart, but is most commonly associated with ischaemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, or high blood pressure. Less common causes include various cardiomyopathies. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk of developing dangerous heart rhythm disturbances or arrhythmias. Cardiomyopathies \nCardiomyopathies are diseases affecting the muscle of the heart. Some cause abnormal thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart to abnormally expand and weaken (dilated cardiomyopathy), some cause the heart muscle to become stiff and unable to fully relax between contractions (restrictive cardiomyopathy) and some make the heart prone to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy). Many cardiomyopathies can lead to heart failure in the later stages of the disease. Valvular heart disease \nHealthy heart valves allow blood to flow easily in one direction, but prevent it from flowing in the other direction. Diseased heart valves may have a narrow opening and therefore restrict the flow of blood in the forward direction (referred to as a stenotic valve), or may allow blood to leak in the reverse direction (referred to as valvular regurgitation). In some parts of the world rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of valvular heart disease, typically leading to mitral or aortic stenosis and caused by the body's immune system reacting to a streptococcal throat infection. Cardiac arrhythmias \n\nWhile in the healthy heart, waves of electrical impulses originate in the sinus node before spreading to the rest of the atria, the atrioventricular node, and finally the ventricles (referred to as a normal sinus rhythm), this normal rhythm can be disrupted. Some types of arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation increase the long term risk of stroke. These arrhythmias can take many forms and can originate from different structures within the heart—some arise from the atria (e.g. hypoplastic left heart syndrome). Other defects include those affecting the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis), or the main blood vessels that lead from the heart (e.g. coarctation of the aorta). More complex syndromes are seen that affect more than one part of the heart (e.g. Some congenital heart defects allow blood that is low in oxygen that would normally be returned to the lungs to instead be pumped back to the rest of the body. These are known as cyanotic congenital heart defects and are often more serious. Major congenital heart defects are often picked up in childhood, shortly after birth, or even before a child is born (e.g. transposition of the great arteries), causing breathlessness and a lower rate of growth. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as \"lub\". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. A different type of sound, a pericardial friction rub can be heard in cases of pericarditis where the inflamed membranes can rub together. As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. They are also useful for evaluating the aorta, the major blood vessel which leaves the heart. Valvular heart disease \nDiseased heart valves that have become abnormally narrow or abnormally leaky may require surgery. In some arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation which increase the risk of stroke, this risk can be reduced using anticoagulants such as warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants. In some patients with heart failure, a specialised pacemaker known as cardiac resynchronisation therapy can be used to improve the heart's pumping efficiency. In very severe cases of heart failure, a small pump called a ventricular assist device may be implanted which supplements the heart's own pumping ability. In the most severe cases, a cardiac transplant may be considered. History\n\nAncient \n\nHumans have known about the heart since ancient times, although its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. Aristotle considered the heart to be the organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. He also discovered the heart valves. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart and created arterial blood. Pre-modern \nThe earliest descriptions of the coronary and pulmonary circulation systems can be found in the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon, published in 1242 by Ibn al-Nafis. In his manuscript, al-Nafis wrote that blood passes through the pulmonary circulation instead of moving from the right to the left ventricle as previously believed by Galen. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows from one side of the heart to the other via the lungs. Modern \n\nA breakthrough in understanding the flow of blood through the heart and body came with the publication of De Motu Cordis (1628) by the English physician William Harvey. Harvey's book completely describes the systemic circulation and the mechanical force of the heart, leading to an overhaul of the Galenic doctrines. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924. It was thought that the heart was examined by Anubis and a variety of deities during the Weighing of the Heart ceremony. The heart is associated with the small intestine, tongue, governs the six organs and five viscera, and belongs to fire in the five elements. Other animals\n\nVertebrates\nThe size of the heart varies among the different animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging from those of the smallest mice (12 mg) to the blue whale (600 kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies in the middle of the ventral part of the body, surrounded by a pericardium. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous, and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat, which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers—two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. There is a heart with three chambers: two atria and one ventricle. The ventricle is incompletely separated into two-halves by a wall (septum), with a considerable gap near the pulmonary artery and aortic openings. The exception to this rule is crocodiles, which have a four-chambered heart. In the heart of lungfish, the septum extends partway into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of separation between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered to the rest of the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate. Full division \nArchosaurs (crocodilians and birds) and mammals show complete separation of the heart into two pumps for a total of four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. Fish\n\nFish have what is often described as a two-chambered heart, consisting of one atrium to receive blood and one ventricle to pump it. The atrium and ventricle are sometimes considered \"true chambers\", while the others are considered \"accessory chambers\". Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart, but the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects deoxygenated blood from the body through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action will take place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus, which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery). In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable. Invertebrates\n\nArthropods and most mollusks have an open circulatory system. In this system, deoxygenated blood collects around the heart in cavities (sinuses). This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the hemocoel, a cavity between the organs. Oxygen travels by diffusion and there are five small muscular vessels that connect these vessels that contract at the front of the animals that can be thought of as \"hearts\". The branchial hearts have two atria and one ventricle each, and pump to the gills, whereas the systemic heart pumps to the body. Only the chordates (including vertebrates) and the hemichordates have a central \"heart\", which is a vesicle formed from the thickening of the aorta and contracts to pump blood.

The heart can be thought of as a muscular pump, consisting of four chambers, and pulsatile muscles which pump and circulates the blood through the vasculature. In most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The left atrium and left ventricle are referred to as the left heart, while the right atrium and right ventricle are known as the right heart. This four-chambered structure allows for efficient blood flow and separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From there, the blood moves into the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood into the pulmonary circulation - the pathway leading to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. These valves prevent backflow of blood and ensure that it moves in a unidirectional manner. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid. It's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body.

Anterior compartment muscles of the thigh include sartorius, and the four muscles that comprise the quadriceps muscles- rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and vastus lateralis. Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Because the major muscles of the thigh are the largest muscles of the body, resistance exercises (strength training) of them stimulate blood flow more than any other localized activity. The piriformis muscle and the gluteus maximus muscle have different functions in the human musculature. The piriformis muscle is pear-shaped and lies deep to the gluteus medius muscle. On the other hand, the gluteus maximus muscle is the largest and most superficial muscle in the gluteal region. The fibers of the gluteus maximus run inferolaterally and attach distally to the iliotibial tract and gluteal tuberosity of the femur. This muscle can extend the thigh from a flexed position when the pelvis is fixed, aid in strong lateral rotation of the thigh, and contribute to strong abduction at the hip. It also helps rotate the pelvis posteriorly on the femur heads when the thigh is stabilized. The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and is important for stabilizing the femur on the tibia. In summary, the piriformis muscle is involved in gait and maintaining balance, while the gluteus maximus muscle is responsible for posture, thigh extension, lateral rotation, abduction, and stabilizing the femur on the tibia. Semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend the hip when the trunk is fixed; they also flex the knee and medially (inwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent. The long head of the biceps femoris extends the hip, as when beginning to walk; both short and long heads flex the knee and laterally (outwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent. Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis irritates the sciatic nerve, which comes into the gluteal region beneath the muscle, causing pain in the buttocks and referred pain along the sciatic nerve. Seventeen percent of the population has their sciatic nerve coursing through the piriformis muscle.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the large buttock and thigh muscle?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We know this because in order for a period to come regularly there are certain events that must occur in the ovary and uterus. First, several of the immature eggs present in the ovary at the beginning of the cycle will begin developing and growing. During the first 9 or 10 days of the cycle, one of the eggs is selected by the ovary to be the “dominant” egg that will eventually mature completely and be released. While it is maturing, the ovary produces estrogen which tells the brain that the ovary is working and also causes thickening of the uterine lining getting ready for implantation of a fertilized egg. Once this egg reaches maturity within its follicle (fluid filled cavity), a surge of hormones from the brain called LH (luteinizing hormone which can be measured by an ovulation predictor kit) causes release of the egg from its follicle. Once the egg is released, the now empty follicle is called a corpus luteum cyst and has the sole purpose of producing the hormone progesterone which acts as the glue keeping the uterine lining intact in preparation for an embryo implanting. The egg will then be picked up by one of the fallopian tubes and hopefully become fertilized by sperm in the tube and then travel into the uterus where it will implant into the thickened uterine wall. How Many Days Out of the Month is a Woman Fertile? After the monthly bleeding ends, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Among these follicles, one will become dominant and continue its maturation process. When the dominant follicle is fully mature, LH triggers its release from the ovary, a process known as ovulation. The released egg then travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus for potential fertilization. After ovulation, the follicle quickly transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. A few develop fully to produce a secondary oocyte which is released by rupture of the follicle in a process called ovulation. Until the preovulatory stage, the follicle contains a primary oocyte that is arrested in prophase of meiosis I. After ovulation, several physiological changes occur in the female reproductive system. One significant change is the transformation of the ruptured follicle into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes hormones such as progesterone and estrogen, which play essential roles in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. This thickening prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. The ovulation process, which marks the release of an egg from the follicle, is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). This surge induces the release of the mature egg, which then travels through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, potentially for fertilization. These physiological changes in the female reproductive system after ovulation are crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and the preparation of the uterus for potential pregnancy. Typically the egg cell is not released or picked up at ovulation, but fertilized within the ovary where the pregnancy implants. Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy.\n\nQuestion: When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. All the while being in sync with the pacemaker cells; this is the property that allows the pacemaker cells to control contraction in all other cardiomyocytes. Cells in the SA node spontaneously depolarize, ultimately resulting in contraction, approximately 100 times per minute. This native rate is constantly modified by the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers via the autonomic nervous system, so that the average resting cardiac rate in adult humans is about 70 beats per minute. Because the sinoatrial node is responsible for the rest of the heart's electrical activity, it is sometimes called the primary pacemaker. cells can become pacemakers. It is important to realize that these cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than the primary or secondary pacemaker cells. The rhythm of the heart's contractions is determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium of the heart. These pacemaker cells generate electrical impulses that stimulate the contraction of the heart muscle. In summary, the rhythm of the heart's contractions is primarily determined by the pacemaker cells in the SA node, which generate electrical impulses that regulate the coordinated contraction of the heart's chambers. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. The reason Purkinje cells do not normally control the heart rate is that they generate action potentials at a lower frequency than the AV or SA nodes.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. Either gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or any gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (such as Lupron) may be used in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH) using an infusion pump to simulate endogenous hormone production. This set of therapy is reserved for a subset of women with infertility and have produced ovulation rates of 90% and pregnancy rates of 80% or higher. Each of these stages involves the interplay of multiple hormones. In the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are secreted pulsatively, stimulating the maturation of the ovarian follicle. The increase in estrogen and progesterone levels leads to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Hormones also play a crucial role in other stages of reproduction. During fetal development, sex determination occurs under the influence of hormone signaling. In conception, hormones such as LH and FSH are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. After conception, various hormones including progesterone, estrogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and prolactin support the development of pregnancy, maintenance of the pregnancy, and initiation of lactation. Overall, hormones play a vital role in each stage of reproduction by regulating the development and function of reproductive organs, controlling the menstrual cycle, supporting pregnancy, and facilitating the physiological changes associated with sexual maturation and menopause. They provide structural support, help in hormone production and release, and create a blood-testis barrier. In the male hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH promotes the maturation of Sertoli cells, while LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. After ovulation, the remaining follicle forms the corpus luteum. The steroidogenic pathways in the ovaries involve the conversion of cholesterol to androgens, which are then converted to estrogen or progesterone. In the female hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis during the menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. FSH promotes follicular development, while LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum. It thickens during the proliferative phase in response to estrogen stimulation and prepares for potential implantation. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads play crucial roles in regulating sex hormones. The hypothalamus, located in the brain, releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the bloodstream. In response to GnRH, the pituitary gland releases two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In males, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, an androgen hormone responsible for male sexual characteristics. FSH, on the other hand, promotes the production of sperm by stimulating the cells in the testes called Sertoli cells. Together, testosterone and sperm production are regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in males. The follicles then produce estrogen, which is responsible for the development of female sexual characteristics.\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of argon, respectively. Some activities and events that have significantly impacted the troposphere in the Anthropocene era include fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, alterations in land use, and the release of certain chemicals into the atmosphere. These emissions have contributed to climate change and air pollution, affecting the troposphere. For example, the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers can lead to the release of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. In summary, activities such as fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, alterations in land use, and the release of certain chemicals have significantly impacted the troposphere in the Anthropocene era. These impacts include climate change, air pollution, and alterations in atmospheric composition, all of which have implications for human health, visibility, climate, and weather. A better understanding of the connections between emissions, reactions, deposition, and atmospheric composition is crucial for developing strategies to minimize the impacts of these anthropogenic activities. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during inert gas asphyxiation. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. In atmospheric chemistry,  is a generic term for the nitrogen oxides that are most relevant for air pollution, namely nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide.

Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal and aquatic plant growth. Approaches for prevention and reversal of eutrophication include: minimizing point source pollution from sewage, and minimizing nutrient pollution from agriculture and other nonpoint pollution sources. Excessive use or improper use of fertilizers, pesticides, and various types of chemicals during farming contribute to water pollution, and are currently the third largest source for water pollution in lakes, second largest source of water pollution in wetlands, and a major contributor to pollution in estuaries and ground water. Some lake water is eutrophic due to agricultural pollution. ; Aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber, also known as an algae turf scrubber. Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an algal turf scrubber (ATS). They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer.\n\nQuestion: What is the term for nutrient enrichment of lakes?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Krypton is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near-surface water, but 81Kr has been used for dating old (50,000–800,000 years) groundwater. It is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium, such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors. decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an alpha particle, so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry.

It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard/sidewalk chalk, and drywall. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. One of its primary uses is in the field of medicine for creating casts and dies. Gypsum is also utilized in dentistry for creating dental casts and dies. Gypsum dies, on the other hand, are used to produce precise and customized dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges. In addition to the medical and dental field, gypsum is used in various other industries. It is commonly used in construction for making plaster of Paris, which is a type of gypsum plaster used for wall and ceiling finishes. Overall, gypsum plays a crucial role in the medical field by allowing for the creation of casts and dies that aid in the healing and treatment of injuries.

James Clerk Maxwell developed a model to explain electric and magnetic phenomena using the aether, a model that led to what are now called Maxwell's equations and the understanding that light is an electromagnetic wave. In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\" was accurate enough to detect aether flow. There was consequent perplexity as to why light evidently behaves like a wave, without any detectable medium through which wave activity might propagate. By 1920, however, the explanation helped solve problems in atomic theory, and thus quantum mechanics emerged. Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous. At experimental paradoxes, physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features. Their orbits would be dynamically unstable, hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon. The way the information gets out seems to be that a true event horizon never forms, just an apparent horizon.\" Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an event occurred.

At some points, Despina's angular diameter rivals that of Ariel from Uranus and Ganymede from Jupiter. Here are the angular diameters for Neptune's moons (for comparison, Earth's moon measures on average 31′ for terrestrial observers): Naiad, 7–13′; Thalassa, 8–14′; Despina, 14–22′; Galatea, 13–18′; Larissa, 10–14′; Proteus, 12–16′; Triton, 26–28′. An alignment of the inner moons would likely produce a spectacular sight. Neptune's largest outer satellite, Nereid, is not large \n\n  There are 80 known moons of Jupiter, not counting a number of moonlets likely shed from the inner moons. All together, they form a satellite system which is called the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. Orbiting the planet at 3.5 million km, it is by far the most distant of Saturn's large \n\n Oberon, also designated Uranus IV, is the outermost major moon of the planet Uranus. It is likely that Oberon formed from the accretion disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation.\n\nQuestion: Proteus and Nereid are moons of which planet?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.

In comparison, in distance to the Milky Way's satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, is only 160,000 light-years from Earth. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. The Milky Way's stellar halo contains globular clusters, RR Lyrae stars with low metal content, and subdwarfs. Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.

These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. On the other hand, general relativity, presented by Einstein in 1915, extends the principles of special relativity to include gravitational forces. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It is important to note that while \"relativity\" primarily refers to these two theories by Einstein, there is also Galilean relativity, which predates them. Galilean relativity was developed by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century and describes how motion appears relative between observers in uniform motion. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. Albert Einstein called this the equivalence principle, and said that only observers who feel no force at all—including the force of gravity—are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating. Einstein \n\n General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.\n\nQuestion: Which force is nothing more than the bending of space and time?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Its apparent angular diameter is about 1 degree. The light of the supernova explosion reached Earth approximately 3700 years ago. Although it overlaps the Vela Supernova Remnant, it is four times more distant. Currently it is moving towards the Solar System at 41 km/s, which means in 2.35 million years it will pass at just 5.519 pc distance, probably becoming the brightest star in the night sky, at magnitude −2.1, for a period. This is giving the star an oblate shape with a prominent equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 21% larger than the polar radius. It is radiating 150 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,016 K.\n\n 36 Capricorni is a single, yellow-hued star in the southern constellation of Capricornus. It is currently moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −21 km/s, and will come within 44.58 pc in about 685,000 years ago. It is approximately 2.9 kpc from Earth. If placed at the center of the Solar System, its photosphere would at least engulf the orbit of Jupiter.

In the traditional subtractive color model used in painting and printing, the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be created by blending or mixing other colors together. With the primary colors, it is possible to create a wide range of other colors by blending them together in different proportions.

South America ranks fourth among all continents in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). The range is 6999. km long, 200. to 700. km wide (widest between 18°S - 20°S latitude), and has an average height of about 4000. m. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.

All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to \"do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people\". Hughes lent her to RKO to star in many films (another source says Greer's husband, Rudy Vallee, \"helped her get out of her contract with Hughes and secure another pact with RKO Studios\" ) including Dick Tracy (1945), Out of the Past (1947), They Won't Believe Me (1947), and the comedy/suspense film The Big Steal (1949), with Out of the Past co-star Robert Mitchum. In 1984, she was cast in Against All Odds, a remake of Out of the Past, as the mother of the character she had played in 1947.

Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. One of the most well-known properties of helium is its low density. This gas is lighter than air, which enables objects to float in air when filled with helium. This property makes helium useful for filling balloons and airships. It remains a gas, even at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. In terms of its chemical properties, helium is an unreactive element and is considered inert. It does not readily form compounds with other elements, which is why it is often referred to as a noble gas.\n\nQuestion: What is the second lightest chemical element?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It has been used as a separate address to the better known 10 Downing Street since 2001 for various government functions. Had the shell struck 10 Downing Street itself, it is likely the entire cabinet would have been killed. Bomb-proof netting on the windows of the cabinet office muffled the force of the explosion, which scorched the back wall of the building, smashed windows and made a crater several feet deep in the garden. In January 2020, the government began hosting lobby briefings at 9 Downing Street instead of the traditional location in the House of Commons. That year the building began undergoing a £2.6-million refurbishment in preparation for televised press briefings to be held. The Downing Street Press Briefing Room is located in No. 9, the first press conferences were held by Boris Johnson in March 2021. Downing Street is a street in central Cambridge, England. The building was previously part of the more famous 10 Downing Street, which has been the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury since 1732. Many internal refurbishments over the years have altered the interior of 10 Downing Street, 11 Downing Street and 12 Downing Street to the point that they are all part of a single complex.

In 1994, advertising executive Trevor Beattie, working for TBWA/London, developed an ad for Sara Lee's \"Hello Boys\" Wonderbra campaign. The ad used only two words: \"Hello boys.\" The perfume was designed by Thierry Wasser from Firmenich. Wasser wanted to create a perfume which reflects the Australian singer: the key notes are Australian sandalwood, star fruit, freesia and Boronia flower. The scent has been subtly updated by Firmenich perfumer Ilias Ermenidis, while the flacon and packaging have also been given a contemporary update. This resulted in the fragrance Un Jardin en Méditerranée, commissioned through Ellena's employer at the time, German fragrance firm Symrise. The next brief in the series called for a fragrance on the theme of \"river\". Its development represented a turning point for Hermès and the perfume industry as a whole. Herzigová also starred in a fashion art film by Imagine Fashion, called Decadent Control with Roberto Cavalli.

The nicknames are sometimes known by the rhyming phrase 'bingo lingo' and there are rhymes for each number from 1 to 90, some of which date back many decades. In some clubs the 'bingo caller' will say the number, with the assembled players intoning the rhyme in a call and response manner, in others, the caller will say the rhyme and the players chant the number. In 2003, Butlins holiday camps introduced some more modern calls devised by a Professor of Popular Culture in an attempt to bring fresh interest to bingo. Since the introduction of the electronic random number generator (RNG) in bingo halls in the UK, the usage of the nicknames or bingo calls above in mainstream bingo has dramatically decreased. Baci, a 6-year-old Labrador retriever presented for lethargy of a few weeks duration. On presentation at Foster Hospital for Small Animals, Baci was found to have mildly icteric sclera. Heinz bodies are indicated by black arrows. Heinz bodies form following oxidation of hemoglobin sulfhydryl groups. Examination of RBCs near the feathered edge may be helpful, since RBCs in this area are more fully flattened out and membrane spicules are often lost, while Heinz bodies should still be visible. Heinz bodies also increase RBC rigidity, rendering them susceptible to entrapment in the spleen where they are phagocytized. In some cases, RBCs may contain several small Heinz bodies (rather than a single large one) and these are much more difficult to visualize in a Wright stained smear. Supravital stains, such as new methylene blue (NMB), as illustrated in Figure 4, can help to confirm the presence of Heinz bodies. Figure 4: Supravital stains, such as new methylene blue (NMB) can help to confirm the presence of Heinz bodies. In dogs, differentials include ingestion of food containing onions or garlic, chemicals (zinc pennies or naphthalene moth balls), skunk spray and drugs (vitamin K1 or acetaminophen). In cats, low numbers of small Heinz bodies can be an incidental finding. Increased numbers of, sometimes quite large, Heinz bodies are found in cats with diabetes mellitus (associated with ketone production), lymphoma and hyperthyroidism. Acetaminophen, propofol, onions, garlic, and benzocaine have also been associated with increased Heinz bodies in cats. A call to the owner revealed the fact that, about one week earlier, Baci had gotten into a cupboard and ingested a bottle of onion flakes. Heinz bodies/eccentrocytes may remain in the circulation for an extended period of time due to the dog’s long RBC lifespan (110-120 days). The number of eccentrocytes and Heinz bodies peaked at 7-8 days, but small numbers of these abnormal RBCs remained present 30 days later. 2005. 2000. The packaging was the subject of a patent lawsuit brought by David Wawrzynski, a Detroit businessperson who claimed to have shown a similar prototype to Heinz executives in 2008. A 2012 judgment in favor of Heinz was vacated in 2014, and a jury finally found that Heinz did not owe Wawrzynski damages in April 2015. Another suit was filed by a Chicago inventor, Scott White, in 2012.\n\n are pre-dropped, leaving numbers 4–9 up. ; Lucky number 7 – The only number up is 7, and the first person to roll a 7 wins. ; Unlucky number 7 – A standard game, when a 7 is rolled, the game stops. ; Against all odds – All odd numbers are up and evens down. ; Even Stevens – All even numbers are up and odds down. ; Full house – 12 numbers are up. ; The 300 – 2 boxes and 4 dice are used, with the second box representing numbers 13–24 (24 + 23 + 22 + ... + 2 + 1 = 300); in the \n\n  Bingo is a game of probability in which players mark off numbers on cards as the numbers are drawn randomly by a caller, the winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers. Bingo, also previously known in the UK as \"Housey-Housey\", became increasingly popular across the UK following the Betting and Gaming Act 1960 with more purpose-built bingo halls opened every year until 2005. Since 2005, bingo halls have seen a marked decline in revenues and the closure of many halls. The number of bingo clubs in Britain has dropped from nearly 600 in 2005 to under 400 as of January, 2014. These closures are blamed on high taxes, the smoking ban, and the rise in online gambling, amongst other things. Bingo played in the UK (90-ball bingo) is not to be confused with bingo played in the US (75-ball bingo), as the tickets and the calling are slightly different.

Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. Citric acid is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla (Indian gooseberry), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava. Many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. Phosphoric acid, for example, is a component of \n\n Malonic acid is a naturally occurring substance found in many fruits and vegetables. There is a suggestion that citrus fruits produced in organic farming contain higher levels of malonic acid than fruits produced in conventional agriculture. Malonic acid was first prepared in 1858 by the French chemist Victor Dessaignes via the oxidation of malic acid. **CITRONELLA OIL •** A natural food flavoring extract from fresh grass grown in Asia. **CITRAURIN, b- •** Raw material for the extraction of carotinoids ( _see_ Carotene), or orange coloring. Found in tangerine and orange peels. **CITRIC ACID •** One of the most widely used acids in the cosmetics and flavoring industries, it is derived from citrus fruit by fermentation of crude sugars. It is also extracted from citrus fruits and occurs naturally in coffee and peaches. Citric acid is used to neutralize lye employed in peeling vegetables, as an adjuster of acidity-alkalinity in fruit juices, wines, jams, jellies, jelly candies, canned fruit, carbonated beverages, frozen fruit, canned vegetables, frozen dairy products, cheese spreads, sherbet, confections, canned figs, dried egg whites, mayonnaise, salad dressing, fruit butter, preserves, and fresh beef blood. Employed in curing meats, for firming peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, and lima beans and to prevent off-flavors in fried potatoes. Citrus fruits are notable for their fragrance, partly due to flavonoids and limonoids (which in turn are terpenes) contained in the rind, and most are juice-laden. The juice contains a high quantity of citric acid and other organic acids giving them their characteristic sharp flavour. The genus is commercially important as many species are cultivated for their fruit, which is eaten fresh, pressed for juice, or preserved in marmalades and pickles.

Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the \"true toads\". Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live \n\nThe oxygen transport mechanisms between larval and adult amphibians differ in several key aspects. This is in contrast to terrestrial amphibians, which rely on lungs for gas exchange. Secondly, larval and adult amphibians have different hemoglobin compositions. No globin chains are shared between larval and adult amphibians. Adult amphibians generally have higher hemoglobin concentrations and packed cell volumes (PCVs) compared to larval forms. Metamorphosis in newts and salamanders may not result in a transition in hemoglobin affinity like in frogs and toads. However, when newts and salamanders switch from aquatic to aerobic respiration at metamorphosis, both larval and adult hemoglobins exhibit the same affinity for oxygen. Lastly, toads, which primarily rely on aerobic respiration, tend to have higher hemoglobin and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations and lower blood oxygen affinity compared to frogs, which primarily rely on anaerobic respiration. These differences in oxygen transport mechanisms reflect the varying physiological adaptations amphibians undergo during their life cycle and their transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. On the other hand, species like Rana clamitans (green frogs) spend longer periods as larvae (3-10 months) and weigh more (3 g) at metamorphosis. Species like Rana palustris (pickerel frogs) fall between wood frogs and green frogs in terms of larval duration and size at metamorphosis. American toads and wood frogs tend to delay dispersal, allowing them to undergo rapid growth and development after metamorphosis. The smaller body sizes of newly metamorphosed toads and wood frogs impose limitations on their behaviors. A true toad is any member of the family Bufonidae, in the order Anura (frogs and toads). This is the only family of anurans in which all members are known as toads, although some may be called frogs (such as harlequin frogs).\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a frog and a toad?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Instead, the National Police Foundation conducts and translates scientific research, training, technical assistance and evaluation to advance policing. Based at Bryn in Oslo and established in 1959, it is a national unit that works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assisting unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, and is responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for international police cooperation, including participation in Interpol and Europol. It is subordinate to the National Police Directorate. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare (\"extradite or prosecute\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \"internationally protected persons\".\n\nQuestion: What is the acronym for the agency which provides co-operation between police forces worldwide?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While documented conditions have included urosepsis, renal colic, cellulitis, pneumonitis, and cardiac arrhythmia, only 17 of these nonfatal severe medical events have been reported during spaceflight between 1961-1999.1 The relatively benign nature of medical problems in space flight is likely due to shorter missions, selection of healthy astronauts, on-board medications, and countermeasures to environmental effects and prolonged microgravity.2 The comprehensive profiling process includes an evaluation of astronauts' physiological and psychosocial well-being, medical history, and extensive laboratory and genetic markers. When emergencies have occurred, they have been managed by both Earth-based medical teams and the assigned crew medical officer on board. Mae Jemison, MD, (a general practitioner) floats in zero gravity at the Spacelab Japan Science module aboard STS-105, Endeavour. With recent aerospace successes, such as the launch of the Orion spacecraft in December 2014, the Curiosity mission in Mars, and unmanned missions to comets and asteroids, the future of space flight seems promising. Plans for commercial space flight to the International Space Station (ISS), interplanetary expeditions, a return to the moon, colonization of neighboring planets, and establishment of bases are underway. For example, one study estimates that the risk of an emergency medical event during a 7-member space flight to Mars would be about 1 emergency event per trip. This may seem negligible until put in the context of a 6-month return to Earth.1,3 Thus, the capability to administer advanced care for illness and injury will undoubtedly be a prerequisite for interplanetary travel and prolonged human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.2 Additionally, as space vehicles move further from Earth's orbit, telemetric medical support and traditional communication traveling at the speed of light will have a longer delay (eg, in the case of Mars, two-way radio contact will require a minimum of 44 minutes).2 Given such delays, the current practice of relying on Earth-based medical consultation and a crew medical officer without extensive medical training may no longer be enough. Other medical events unique to space also must be anticipated, particularly higher incidence of space radiation, injuries from increased extravehicular activities, space debris, and increased susceptibility for infection. Astronaut Luca Parmitano collects fundoscopic images with the help of astronaut Chris Cassidy for the Ocular Health experiment. Future space travelers are unlikely to be as fit and healthy as past astronauts, adding to the likelihood of increased medical incidents in space. Despite these restrictions, the space tourist will be less healthy and less equipped to handle emergencies than previous space travelers who spent years preparing for a mission. Although a Soyuz spacecraft docked on the ISS can be used for evacuation today, space emergency medical systems and emergency departments may soon adopt more visible roles as more tourists fly and as extended missions become a reality. Only 5 EM-trained American physician-astronauts have flown in space: Thomas Marshburn, MD; Anna Fisher, MD; William Hendrick Fisher, MD; Scott Parazynski, MD; and Kjell Lindgren, MD.4 The emergency medicine training experience has many qualities that make emergency physicians the best potential medical providers for the future of human space flight: comfort with rapid assessment and treatment, resuscitation expertise, ability to perform a wide range of advanced procedures, exposure to diverse pathologies, and creativity in resource limited settings.

In 1881, he made an accidental discovery that turned out to be of great importance. At the time, Edison was attempting to produce a reliable and commercial electric light bulb. The essence of his idea was that a filament would glow within a glass envelope from which the air had been evacuated when electrically energized with direct current (DC). The exclusion of air was essential to maximize the life of the filament. Edison had chosen a carbonized (burned) \n\n finance during his time at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; \"to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development.\" Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. The company became known as Consolidated Edison. filament for his new lamp, but this solution was not perfect. After being heated to incandescence for a few hours, carbon from the filament would be deposited on the inside walls of the bulb, turning it black. Hammer noticed the carbon seemed to be coming from the end of the filament that was attached to the negative terminal of the DC power supply, and seemed to be flying through the vacuum onto the walls of the bulb, a phenomenon that Edison observed in 1875. On February 13, 1880, Edison determined that not only was carbon flying through the vacuum, but that it carried a charge. Also known as the irrational fear of the dark, nyctophobia can cause someone to avoid dark places. It still remains as one of the most common fears of children. Published by Hypnosis in London on 26 September 2016, written by Malminder Gill. Many children are afraid of the dark. In fact, it is estimated that about 90% of children have this kind of fear. A person with nyctophobia may have experienced as a child being punished or abused in a dark room. Those who are not able to overcome this fear may grow up as adults bringing along this fear.

It is a specific phobia that can cause significant distress and impair an individual's daily functioning. People with thanatophobia often have an overwhelming fear of their own death or the death of loved ones. This fear may be triggered by thoughts of dying, witnessing death, or being in situations related to mortality, such as hospitals or funerals. Symptoms of thanatophobia can vary from person to person but may include extreme anxiety, panic attacks, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, nausea, and a sense of impending doom. The exact causes of thanatophobia are not fully understood, but it is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Traumatic experiences, such as the loss of a loved one or a near-death experience, may also contribute to the development of this phobia. They can offer a personalized treatment approach and support to address the impact of thanatophobia on an individual's life. Bruxism, which is an abnormal repetitive movement disorder characterised by jaw clenching and tooth grinding, is also a causative factor in the development of dental issues, including tooth mobility. Chalky teeth and derivative terms (\"chalky molars\", \"chalky enamel\") have received widespread exposure as a metaphor for malformed teeth with elevated risk of tooth decay. The gritty sensation elicited by oxalate-rich foods such as spinach may also be described as \"chalky teeth'. Potential reasons include work confinement, working with anxious patients, time pressures, complex treatment and personality traits within dentists themselves (the need for perfection, attention to detail, high expectations of themselves and others). Acrophobia is a common phobia and can have a significant impact on a person's daily life. Additionally, acrophobia can also cause physiological symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, and a sense of impending doom or panic attack. Traumatic experiences or accidents involving heights can contribute to the development of this phobia. Treatment for acrophobia often includes a combination of therapy techniques. In conclusion, acrophobia is an intense and irrational fear of heights that can significantly impact a person's life. It is treatable through various therapy techniques, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy.\n\nQuestion: Taphephobia is the fear of losing your teeth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at age 24. , born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. In 1896 Nobel died of a stroke in his villa in San Remo, Italy where he had lived out the last years of his life. On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin.\n\nQuestion: The invention of what in 1867, made Alfred Nobel famous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

(The world's first live televised sporting event had been the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. ) The first show featured a complete game between basketball's Harlem Globetrotters and their foils at that time, the Baltimore Rockets. On September7, 1979, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 30,000 viewers tuned in to witness the launch of ESPN. Simultaneously, ESPN debuted its first SportsCenter telecast with anchors Lee Leonard and George Grande. The broadcast established what was then the longest continuous coverage of a sporting event in American television history. NBC broadcast the game on station W2XBS with one camera and Bill Stern was the sole announcer. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. The game came just one month after the Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the first-ever televised professional baseball game, and five months after the Princeton and Columbia baseball teams played the first televised sporting event. On February 28, 1940, the University of Pittsburgh played Fordham at Madison Square Garden in the first televised basketball game.\n\nQuestion: In 1931, what became the first ever televised sports event?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent. Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album. During the Spice Girls hiatus, Bunton released her debut solo album, A Girl Like Me (2001), which debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. After the song was placed into heavy rotation on FM stations in Japan, the Spice Girls made promotional tours in May, July, and September 1996. The group received major press and TV exposure, appearing in programmes such as Space Shower. \"Wannabe\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number three, six days after its physical release, with sales \n\n As the Spice Girls' debut single, \"Wannabe\" has been credited for catapulting the band to global stardom and ushering in \"Spicemania\" in the late 1990s.

Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones. way in flats and in another way using sharps. After C comes the key of G (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A). Such keys with double accidentals in the key signatures are called theoretical keys: the appearance of their key signatures is extremely rare, but they are sometimes tonicised in the course of a work (particularly if the home key was already heavily sharped or flatted). There does not appear to be a standard on how to notate theoretical key signatures: \n\n In music, flat (Italian bemolle for \"soft B\") means \"lower in pitch\". Flat is the opposite of sharp, which is a raising of pitch. In musical notation, flat means \"lower in pitch by one semitone (half step)\", notated using the symbol which is derived from a stylised lowercase 'b'. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents. In intonation, flat can also mean \"slightly lower in pitch\" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is \"flat\" with respect to the other.\n\nQuestion: What are the only two musical notes which have no flats?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Most french fries are produced from frozen Russet potatoes. French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. Potatoes entered the German cuisine in the late 17th century, and were almost ubiquitous in the 19th century and since. French fries, called Pommes frites, Pommes (spoken as \"Pom fritz\" or, respectively, \"Pommes\", deviating from the French pronunciation which would be \"Pom freet\" or \"Pom\") or regionally as Fritten in German, are a common style of fried potatoes; they are traditionally offered with either ketchup or mayonnaise, or, as Pommes rot/weiß (lit. fries red/white), with both. Also common are dumplings (including Klöße as the term in the north or Knödel as the term in the south) and in southern Germany potato noodles, including Schupfnudeln, which are similar to Italian gnocchi. In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (Paprika, sometimes also called ungarisch (from \"Hungarian\")) and salted (gesalzen). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"Chakalaka\", \"Currywurst\", \"Pommes\" (french fries), \"Rot-weiss\" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). The thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3–4 mm). A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries. French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words).\n\nQuestion: From which country do French fries originate?

She is relieved, but unfortunately suddenly sees a monstrous humanoid with all-white eyes and an open mouth at her bedside table. It turns off the lamp, and the screen goes dark. She sneaks into the laundry room to retrieve it, and makes another attempt to contact emergency services; due to the high volume of calls, however, she is unable to do so.

We talked about seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a depressive illness caused by a lack of exposure to natural light, and Mary decided to purchase a full-spectrum light; her health insurance company eventually reimbursed her. On a dark and rainy night, a woman (Lotta Losten) comes out of a room and turns off the hallway light, which causes a long-haired, humanlike silhouette to become visible at the other end of the hallway. Surprised, the woman turns the light back on and the silhouette vanishes. Switching the light off and on, she watches the silhouette appear and disappear, stopping when the silhouette suddenly moves so close it is inches away from her face. Gasping, she turns the light back on and tapes the switch in that position to prevent the silhouette from returning. The woman goes to bed, leaving the lamp on her bedside table on and the door leading to the lit hallway ajar. She hears creaking sounds and looks towards the\n\nQuestion: Mary has a large bedroom and the only light switch is on the wall approximately 20 feet away from her bed.

He climbs up a flight of stairs to the top floor, opens the unlocked door to the apartment, and is shocked to see his father making love to his fiancée. Though the building is physically 68 stories tall,  the top floor is numbered 78. Floor number 13 is skipped, and floor 17 (containing mechanical equipment) is not labeled on the building's condominium offering plan. The first residential story, floor 30, would have been labeled as floor 18 under traditional counting methods and if the mechanical story was counted as one floor. In 19th-century London, many buildings were built with the main entrance floor a metre above ground, and the floor below that being two metres below ground. This was done partly for aesthetics, and partly to allow access between the lower level and the street without going through the main floor. In this situation, the lower level is called Lower Ground, the main floor is called Upper Ground, and floors above it are numbered serially from 1. Sometimes, floor number 1 \n\n traffic necessitates a second lift the alternate floors strategy is sometimes still applied, not only for the doorway reduction but also, provisionally upon the passengers preferring no particular floor beyond capacity, it tends toward halving the total delay imposed by the stops en-route. Sometimes, two elevators are divided so that all floors are served, but one elevator only serves odd floors and the other even, which would often be less efficient for passengers, but cheaper to install because the group control of elevators was more complex than single control.\n\nQuestion: A man lives on the 20th floor of a block of flats.

In 2014, there were nearly 70,000 people self-identifying as \"Siamese\" or \"Thai\" who held Malaysian nationality. This number excludes the senior citizen Siamese who live in Malaysia but do not hold Malaysian citizenship because of political constraint. At an ASEAN meeting in 1995, Cambodia suggested that the boxing style made popular from Thailand, Muay Thai, be referred to as \"Sovannaphum boxing\" or \"SEA Boxing\", which represented Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Sovannaphum means \"golden land\" in Khmer and is written as Suwannabhumi in Thai. The name refers to mainland Southeast Asia in the Indian language of Pali. Meanwhile, Krabi had a Buddhist majority in both 1990 and 2000 but nevertheless had a huge Muslim minority of over one-third of its total population in both of these years. Bangkok was the only exception to this rule in 1970, and just barely, whereas Chiang Rai, Tak, Ranong, and Mae Hong Son (but not Bangkok) were the only exceptions to this rule in 2000. Portuguese traders introduced firearms as well as New-World goods from the Columbian Exchange, influencing Thai cuisine, language and culture. Although Portugal's overseas influence gradually declined from the 17th century, it maintained ties with Siam. In contrast to other European powers, against whose colonial aspirations Siam struggled during the 19th century, Siam's relationship with Portugal was largely friendly. Today, the two countries share a small amount of trade, tourism and cultural activities.\n\nQuestion: Which Asian country was once called Siam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and Meuse presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the European Union. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing. Although this agreement was signed on a river boat on the river Moselle near Schengen, at the border triangle of Lorraine, Luxembourg and Saarland, it was not created especially for the use of the region, but the whole of the founding members: the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, the French Republic, and now 28 European States. The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised. Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for Albrecht von Württemberg's Fourth Army. One of the railways from the northern Rhineland into France passed through Troisvierges, in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of Troisvierges station.

For the 12\" vinyl and CD versions of the single, a bonus cover version of \"I'm a Believer\" was included, which featured Rogers on lead vocal. We'd smile and say \"Hi,\" but I was still crazy about him so I always had to hide how I felt, and be cool and casual.\" \"There's the Girl\" is a song recorded by the American rock band, Heart. It was composed by Holly Knight and Heart band member Nancy Wilson. Knight is known as a very successful songwriter who was responsible for penning many hit singles during the 1980s. Like Heart's 1986 #1 single \"These Dreams\", the lead vocals on \"There's the Girl\" were performed by Nancy Wilson, rather than Ann Wilson, the usual lead singer for the group (though most fans did not realize this until the video was released or they saw the song performed live). The song made appearances in late 1987 episodes of the daytime soap operas All My Children and The Young and the Restless. When Valentine was 9 years old, he and his brother formed the band The Newtrons. Valentine’s 2011 album The Testimony featured artists Keri Hilson, Tank, Twista, Gucci Mane and LeToya Luckett. Valentine recorded “My Girl” with Chris Brown for In My Zone 2. Valentine’s production company, Song Dynasty, includes his brother Bobby Newt, his friend Texx and the singer Tank. The team has written and produced songs for artists such as Jamie Foxx, Keyshia Cole and Ron Isley. They wrote the song “Regret” for R&B singer LeToya Luckett featuring Ludacris, which also peaked at #78 on the U.S. \"Valentine\" is a song co-written and performed by American recording artist Jim Brickman, with a guest vocal from Martina McBride.\n\nQuestion: Who had a top ten hit in 1988 with Valentine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This game features a name error in which Blinky and Clyde's names are swapped. A fifth, yellow ghost who wears glasses named Kinky is introduced in this game. The player controls the eponymous Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie), and scores points by eating all of the dots in the maze, while four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Tim) chase him around the maze and attempt to catch him. Eating an power pellet turns the ghosts blue, briefly allowing the player to eat them for extra points. The neon art-style was inspired by the fluorescent lights used in early LCD handheld games, made to help it stand out among other games. Created by Toru Iwatani, he first appeared in the arcade game Pac-Man (1980), and has since appeared in more than 30 licensed sequels and spin-offs for multiple platforms, and spawning mass amounts of merchandise in his image, including two television series and a hit single by Buckner & Garcia.

The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee. The hip is located where the top of the femur bone, or thighbone, fits into the pelvis. The femur bone is the longest bone in the body, extending from the knee to the hip. At the top of the femur bone is the greater trochanter, that boney knob that people often refer to as their hip, and the bulbous \"femoral head\" which makes contact with the pelvis and forms the ball of the ball and socket joint. The femoral head fits into the acetabulum, the round socket of the pelvic bone. Both the femoral head and the acetabulum are lined with articular cartilage. When the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum, the articular cartilage allows the two surfaces to glide against each other. A strong piece of cartilage, called the labrum, rings the outer edge of the acetabulum. The labrum deepens the socket joint, making the joint more stable, but its elasticity allows for flexibility. Over time the smooth articular cartilage that makes up the surfaces of the hip joint may be damaged or blemished by normal wear and tear or from trauma. The hip has several ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvis and tendons connecting the bones to many surrounding muscles. Strong and flexible ligaments and tendons provide structure to the hip, reducing strain on the joint, so most hip osteoarthritis therapies will including stretching and strengthening of these structures. When the hip is at rest, the synovial fluid is stored in the cartilage, much like water in a sponge. When the hip rotates or bears weight the synovial fluid is squeezed out. Small sacs of synovial fluid, called bursae (singular is \"bursa\") surround all major joints, including the hip joint. When the hip joint becomes inflamed and painful, the pain may be felt in the groin but may also be referred into the back, buttocks and down the front or back of the leg. The distal end of the femur, or thigh bone, has several important features that contribute to its function in the skeletal structure. This head forms part of the hip joint, connecting with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone. The angled neck of the femur allows for efficient weight-bearing and distribution of forces during movements such as walking or running. The trochanter serves as an attachment point for various muscles of the hip, including the gluteal muscles. In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.\n\nQuestion: More commonly known as the thigh bone, what is the medical name for the longest bone in the human body?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Just as being ambidextrous means being able to use both the left and right hand equally, organizational ambidexterity requires the organizations to use both exploration and exploitation techniques to be successful. From wielding a club to threading a needle, our hands enable us to engage in both rough motor skills and fine motor skills. One crucial function of the hands is their ability to provide tactile feedback. In terms of handedness, each hand is predominantly controlled by the opposite hemisphere of the brain. This means that individuals have a preferred hand choice for single-handed activities like writing or using utensils. Handedness is determined by genetic factors and reflects an individual trait. It's important to note that while handedness is common, it is not universal. Some individuals may be ambidextrous, meaning they can use both hands equally well for various tasks. Overall, the human hands play a vital role in our daily lives by enabling us to interact with our environment and experience the world through touch.\n\nQuestion: What word is used to describe someone who is neither left or right handed, but can use both hands with equal ease?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Upon arriving at school, he is shocked to find Kate is his teacher. After an awkward day at class, she asks him to stay back. Jack uncomfortably considers transferring classes, but they begin kissing, continuing their affair.

In Batman Returns, Batman faces the Penguin, who plots to kill all of Gotham City's firstborn sons, while dealing with Max Shreck, a corrupt tycoon who allies with the Penguin to bring Gotham City under his control, and Catwoman, who seeks vengeance against Shreck. This new line included several versions of the same Batman figure sculpt as seen in the previous Dark Knight Collection line.

The run was inspired by DC's recent comic run Batman '66, which was a continuation of the 1966 television series starring Adam West and Burt Ward. The story would also introduce iterations of Barbara Gordon, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn into the world. However, the comic run was initially rejected by DC. In February 2021, it was confirmed that DC would in fact be proceeding to develop a canonical comic continuation of Tim Burton's Batman films, with screenwriter Sam Hamm returning to write the script while Joe Quinones provides the comic's art.\n\nQuestion: Batman Returns, Practical Magic, Dead Calm, The Peacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The premise of the novel revolves around the daily lives of a Mormon family, and the challenges they face after a move to North Carolina. Dealing with themes such as religion and the nature of good and evil, the novel is an expansion of Card's short story \"Lost Boys\". The plot of the short story is similar to the plot of the novel but Card assumes the role of the protagonist, Fletcher, \n\n Toast: The Story of a Boy's Hunger, a moving and award-winning autobiography focused on his love of food, his childhood, his family relationships (his mother died of asthma when he was nine) and his burgeoning homosexuality.

Toast was published in Britain in October 2004 and became a best-seller after it was featured on the Richard & Judy Book Club. As he told The Observer, \"The last bit of the book is very foody. But that is how it was. Towards the end I finally get rid of these two people in my life I did not like [his father and stepmother, who had been the family's cleaning lady]—and to be honest I was really very jubilant—and thereafter all I wanted to do was cook.\" The music varies from established classics like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to independents like Ani DiFranco, Top 40 pop like Nelly Furtado, and a few songs with special meaning only to Hornby. Song by song, Hornby delves into what makes music catchy or classic, and how it can come to play an integral role in a person's emotional life. Proceeds from the book go to the TreeHouse Trust, a UK charity operating a school for children with autism and communications disorders, which Hornby's son attends, and to 826 Valencia, a US-based learning center, founded by McSweeney's publisher Dave Eggers, that offers writing workshops and tutoring. After the release of \"Songbook,\" McSweeney accepted online submissions from authors writing about their favourite songs in the same manner as Hornby. The Heart  is a 2014 realistic and medical fiction novel by the French author Maylis de Kerangal. It chronicles the events immediately following the death of 19-year-old Simon Limbres in a car accident. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. Plot \nEarly one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. Characters \n Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Marianne Limbres is Simon's mother. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. She is resentful of Simon's passion for surfing, which she sees as an intrusion in their relationship. He hails from the so-called \"Harfang Dynasty,\" a prominent and wealthy family consisting of generations of physicians. Themes \nA central theme of The Heart is the acceptance of reality and death. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with the passing of their son Simon, a strong, healthy young man who lived his life fearlessly and immensely. Meanwhile, Marianne blames herself for not doing enough to protect Simon from his reckless lifestyle, but she eventually realizes that allowing him to lead his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean could've done for him. Ultimately, Sean and Marianne allow Simon to be an organ donor, which is a milestone towards their gradual acceptance of his death and moving on. To the Limbres, Simon's body is not merely a large mass of skin, tissue, muscle, and bone; it is a tangible symbol for his life, for his existence on Earth, and for the impacts he made on the lives of those who loved him most. In essence, Simon's body serves as a memorial in dedication to his life, and ruining it would diminish his memory and legacy. Although Marianne and Sean eventually give their consent for Simon to be an organ donor, they refuse to donate his eyes, thus showcasing the symbolic differences between each organ. Background and development \n\nIn 2007, after watching a television report on heart transplantation, Maylis de Kerangal wrote a short piece titled Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body for Who is Alive?, a compilation book commemorating the 10th anniversary of the French publisher Éditions Verticales. Over the next five years, de Kerangal experienced personal grief and revitalized her interest in heart transplantation, which inspired her to write about the heart not just as an essential organ in the human body like she did in Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body, but as a source of love, emotion, and humanism. She subsequently began writing The Heart in July 2012. While developing and writing the novel, de Kerangal consulted with an organ transplant coordinating nurse at the Biomedicine Agency in Saint-Denis, France, who educated her on the legal aspects of organ transplantation and the process of obtaining consent from family members of the deceased. French journalist and author Pierre Assouline referred to The Heart as \"a novel of great beauty, a writing, a language dazzling\" and as \"fine and intelligent without ever pushing the collar.\" In his review, French journalist and television personality Bernard Pivot described The Heart as a \"story driven with [the] surgical precision of a heart transplant\" and called it \"an extraordinary novel that now classifies Maylis de Kerangal among the major writers of the early twenty-first century.\" French cultural and television magazine Télérama gave The Heart a five-star rating and commended the continuous flow and musicality of de Kerangal's prose. In the United States, The Heart received similar praise. In her review for The New York Times, Priya Parmar recounted the novel as a \"...story [that] unfolds in an intricate lacework of precise detail\" and described the characters as \"less like fictional creations and more like ordinary people, briefly illuminated in rich language, beautifully translated by Sam Taylor, that veers from the medical to the philosophical.\" In her critique for the American edition of The Guardian, Lydia Kiesling emphasized on how The Heart embodied the importance of narratives to medicine and vice versa, and also commended de Kerangal as a \"master of momentum\" who \"liberates medicine from the language that, by necessity, has constrained its practice.\" In an entry titled \"A Poetic Novel About Grief\" for his blog Gates Notes, Bill Gates described The Heart  as \"poetry disguised as a novel\" that deftly formed a strong connection between readers and characters who appear only briefly in the novel, and that compelled him to \"feel the depth of grief,\" which he identified as a fulfilling and insightful personal experience. In a mixed review, Kirkus Reviews criticized The Heart for becoming \"anticlimactic\" in its second half after its crucial turning point and described it as \"a sophisticated medical drama whose pulse-pounding strength diminishes a touch too quickly.\" Awards \nSince its first publication in 2014, The Heart has received several accolades, including:\n\nFrench \n\n 2014 Grand Prix RTL-Lire\n 2014 Prix Pierre-Espil\n 2014 Orange Book Award\n 2014 Charles Brisset Literary Award\n 2014 Lire Magazine Best French Novel Prize\n 2014 L'Express - BFMTV Reader's Prize\n 2014 Prix France Culture-Télérama - Student Choice Novel\n 2015 Relay Prize for Travelers\n\nEnglish \n\n 2017 Wellcome Book Prize\n\nAdaptations \n\nIn France, The Heart has been adapted by French actor Emmanuel Noblet into a one-man stage play named after the original French title of the novel, Réparer les vivants. The Heart has also been adapted into a film, Heal the Living, directed by Katell Quillévéré and starring Emmanuelle Seigner as Marianne Limbres, Tahar Rahim as Thomas Rémige, Anne Dorval as Claire Méjan, and Gabin Verdet as Simon Limbres.

Haggis has received praise for being the first to successfully create a climbing, trick-taking game, designed from the start for two to three players, where most previous games required four players or more. The evenly distributed, face card \"bombs\" are a notable innovation for the genre, helping even out hand strength enough to make two-person play workable, and enhancing the strategic element of the game. The game's designer, Sean Ross, developed Haggis over a period of several years, with first publication in late 2010 by Indie Boards and Cards. The game was named after haggis partly in a nod to Ross' Scottish heritage, but also because the game brought together the \"guts\" (scoring and play mechanisms) of several other climbing games. Haggis was a nominee for \"Best Card Game\" in the 2010 Golden Geek Awards by BoardGameGeek. The googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler's most effective most important wicket-taking balls. The googly is similar in principle to the doosra, the ball from an off-spinner that turns the opposite way from his stock ball. single-deck games better for counters. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. A card cheat will typically bend some of the important cards during the game. In poker, for instance, a cheat may crimp one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. Similarly, if the card cheat is not working with a confederate, he may bend one or more cards to force a cut upon an unsuspecting victim. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page.\n\nQuestion: With which game would you use a squidger, a circular disc between 25mm and 51 mm?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students. Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s, with no author identified for the new lyrics, nor credit given for the melody from \"Good Morning to You\". Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company, and a series of court cases (which all settled out of court), the sisters became known as the authors of \"Happy Birthday to You\". One of the first was made by Dan W. Quinn for Berliner Gramophone in 1895, which is the same year the song was first published. Mildred Jane Hill, born in Louisville, Kentucky, was the oldest of three sisters, Mildred, Patty, and Jessica. It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher, like her younger sister Patty. Hill died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916, long before her song became famous. She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Mildred Hill's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nQuestion: The melody for which famous song was written by sisters and school teachers Patty and Mildred Hill in Kentucky in 1893?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The simpler symbols of the heraldic badges of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names. Some pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. are popular pub signs and names. It thus can stand for an archetypal British pub. The lion is one of the most common charges in coats of arms, second only to the cross, and thus the Red Lion as a pub sign probably has multiple origins: in the arms or crest of a local landowner, now perhaps forgotten; as a personal badge of John of Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster; or in the royal arms \n\n  Pub names are used to identify and differentiate traditional drinking establishments. Many pubs (public houses) are centuries old, and were named at a time when most of their customers were illiterate, but could recognise pub signs. British pubs may be named after and depict anything from everyday (particularly agricultural) objects, to sovereigns, aristocrats and landowners (shown by their coats of arms).

The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming Kevin the Teenager, one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations. The family harmony was strained when Kevin found out that Kitty was going to work for a senator (Rob Lowe) who had voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.

In genetics, a palindrome refers to a DNA sequence that reads the same way forward and backward. Kaibun (回文; literally circle sentence) is a Japanese equivalent of the palindrome, or in other words, a sentence that reads the same from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning. The unit of kaibun is mora, since the Japanese language uses syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Single word palindromes are not uncommon in Japanese. For example, Ku-ku (九九, multiplication table), Shi-n-bu-n-shi (新聞紙, newspaper), to-ma-to (トマト, tomato), etc. So kaibun usually refers to a palindromic sentence, but a passage can be a kaibun too. In classics, diacritic marks are often ignored. Rather than saying \"read the same forwards and backwards\", because Japanese is traditionally written vertically, Japanese people describe the word as being the same when read from the top (ue kara yomu) as when read from the bottom (shita kara yomu). yātayā tarasā cārustanayānaghayā śritaṃ The 34th stanza is the 33rd stanza written backwards, with a different meaning. Finally, the 27th stanza is an example of what has been called \"the most complex and exquisite type of palindrome ever invented\". It may also be thought of as a syllabic Sator Square.

Secondly, ambigraphic notation assists in the visualization of palindromes, which are sequences that read the same forward and backward. This is particularly relevant in genetic research, as palindromic sequences often have significant functional implications. By using this notation, researchers can easily identify and analyze palindromic regions in genetic sequences. Furthermore, ambigraphic notation utilizes common orthographic features such as stems and loops to highlight regions rich in guanine and cytosine.\n\nQuestion: What seven letter word, beginning with the letters 'Ra' is a palindrome?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When Epic Records was compiling Donovan's Greatest Hits, they were either unable or unwilling to secure the rights to the original recordings of \"Catch the Wind\" and \"Colours\". Donovan re-recorded both songs in the studio with Big Jim Sullivan playing guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards and Clem Cattini on drums, produced by Mickie Most. The relative lack of success in the United Kingdom was most likely the reason leading to Hickory Records selecting \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\" as Donovan's next single in the United States. The 45 was one of the records in John Lennon's jukebox. The song was written about Donovan's friend Joan Baez, with whom he claimed he was in love. Baez recorded a version of the song in 1967 (album: Joan). The lyric begins: \n\n“''Your smile beams like sunlight ; ''On a gull’s wing; and the leaves ; Dance and play after you; ; Take my hand and hold it ; As you would a flower; ; ''Take care with my heart, Oh darling: ; She’s made of glass.” \"Turquoise\" is a song written and recorded by British singer-songwriter Donovan. \"Turquoise\" marked a significant drop-off in Donovan's UK chart success compared to the top 10 successes of \"Catch the \n\n Greatest Hits is a compilation album by singer Jason Donovan.

Two regular strands involved a series of different women making dating agency videos about their general likes and dislikes, and a musical parody that would close the show. In 2002, it was the theme to the comedy-drama series Any Time Now, and used as the theme tune of the video game This is Football 2003. In 2004, it was featured as the theme tune of the first series of The Catherine Tate Show and was also featured in the 2005 film Kinky Boots (including on its soundtrack album). & Dave had previously been offered the chance to record the theme song for another BBC sitcom, Only Fools and Horses, but turned it down as they were in Australia at the time due to the success of \"Ain't No Pleasing You\". However, their song \"Margate\" was used in a feature-length episode of the series entitled \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\" in 1989. They also created the theme tune and incidental music for the children television show Bangers and Mash, and recorded the title theme for Crackerjack! The song gained mass public exposure when it was selected by Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash to be the theme tune to their sitcom The Royle Family. Although it had modest beginnings, the series soon became popular and its theme became well known. The opening credits of the series edited together the first stanza of the first verse and the second stanza of the first chorus. The end credits, which would cut in immediately after the final joke of the episode – so as to add weight to it – began with the second stanza of the final chorus and would see the song through to the coda. Originally \"Spot the Pony\", it was changed at Kevin Lygo's suggestion to \"Smack the Pony\" which some people mistakenly assumed was some kind of sexual euphemism.\n\nQuestion: The theme tune to which TV show starts with the line Stick a pony in me pocket?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Those areas of the court in which chases can be called are marked with lines \n\n The chair umpire is the final authority on all questions of fact during the match. Questions of fact include whether a ball was in, the calling of a service let or the calling of a foot-fault. At the conclusion of a point, game, or set, the chair umpire times the players to ensure they follow ITF regulations on pace of play. The ball can only touch the net on a return and will be considered good if it falls on the opposite side. If the ball contacts the net on the serve but then proceeds to the proper service box, it is called a let; this is not a legal serve in the major tours (but see below) \n\n A let occurs when a legally delivered ball lands in the cross-court service box having touched the net cord (but not the net post or any other object). Play stops immediately, and the serve must be redone. The umpire (or opposing player when there is no umpire) will usually say \"let\" or \"net\" to signal to the server a let has occurred.

However, this symbolism is rejected by Ulster unionists, as illustrated by an exchange in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1951: -James McSparran (Nationalist Party): The tricolour is admitted by all nations within the comity of nations to be the national flag of Ireland. It is the national flag of the Irish Republic. It is also used for the Ireland international rules football team, selected by the GAA on an all-island basis. Green is a symbol of Ireland, which is often referred to as the \"Emerald Isle\". The color is particularly identified with the republican and nationalist traditions in modern times. It is used this way on the flag of the Republic of Ireland, in balance with white and the Protestant orange. The flag first appeared at the Congress of Europe in 1948, which was organised by the International Committee of the Movements for European Unity; however, the colour of the E was red. It intended the flag to be a symbol of hope for peace and unity in Europe. The red in the flag stands for the revolutionary zeal of the youth and the sky blue symbolises their desire for peace. The change from blue to green started in the 17th century with Owen Roe O'Neill and Confederate Ireland, The colour green became associated with Ireland from the 1640s onwards. This was a common flag used to represent Ireland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

He was the first player to win all four Grand Slam singles titles and helped lead the Great Britain team to four Davis Cup wins. English women who have won Wimbledon include: Ann Haydon Jones in 1969 and Virginia Wade in \n\n silver in 1931, and another bronze in 1929 with the England team. George Patrick Hughes (21 December 1902 – 8 May 1997) was an English tennis player. Between 1929 and 1936 Hughes was a member of the British Davis Cup team. Hughes had been the only British man to reach the singles final at the Italian championships, capturing the title in 1931 and runner-up the following year, until Andy Murray won the tournament in 2016. Hughes captured the doubles title in both those years too, when the tournament, in its infancy, was played in Milan. However, this has taken an about turn in recent years with emergence of Andy Murray, and doubles players Colin Fleming and Jamie Murray. On 7 July 2013 he became the first British player to win the men's singles at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936, 77 years before. Colin Fleming along with his English partner Ross Hutchins is currently ranked 9th in the ATP Doubles Team Rankings. At the Australian Open in December 1977, Lloyd became the first British male tennis player in the Open era to reach a Grand Slam singles final. He lost in five sets to America's Vitas Gerulaitis 6–3, 7–6, 5–7, 3–6, 6–2. No other British player reached a Grand Slam final for 20 years, until British-Canadian Greg Rusedski reached the US Open final in 1997.

From heart disease and strokes to certain types of cancer, here’s why your blood type matters. Unless you’ve recently given blood, you may not think much about your blood type. The presence or absence of certain molecules called A or B antigens, as well as a protein called the Rh factor, determine which of the eight common blood types you have coursing through your veins. However, these antigens make a difference beyond just your blood, influencing other body systems like your blood vessels, nerve cells, and blood platelets—which is why your blood type may impact your risk of certain diseases. Here’s why you should know what blood type you have. Non-O blood types have 25 to 30 percent higher levels of blood clotting proteins known as von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. Considering that type Os have lower quantities of the proteins that help blood coagulate, they’re also less likely to suffer from blood clots. (The downside is that blood clotting helps prevent excessive bleeding.) “It shouldn’t be assumed that being an O blood type means an individual is ‘protected’ or an A blood type is at higher risk,” says American Society of Hematology Councillor Terry B. Gernsheimer, MD. O may be the most common blood type, but it can interfere with pregnancy. Another interesting finding from the BMC Medicine study: Non-O blood types (A, B, or AB) also had an increased risk of gastric cancers, possibly due to an inflammatory response to H. pylori bacteria, the researchers write. (The bacteria is a cause of gastric ulcers.) Because of differences in clotting, A/B blood types are 31 percent more likely to suffer from venous thromboembolism—a clot that forms in the deep veins of the leg, groin, or arm—compared to the O type, according to research from the University of Minnesota. Though AB is the least common blood type, research suggests that people with AB are 82 percent more likely to develop cognitive issues in the future. It may be because this blood type comes along with higher levels of factor VIII, the study authors say. People with A or B blood type have up to 21 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, per Diabetologia. (B positive had the highest odds.) While researchers note that it’s not exactly known why, one thought is that it may be that blood type influences the GI microbiome, which can affect glucose metabolism and inflammation. Another study found that although following the diet may work, it has nothing to do with someone’s specific blood type. There’s a theory that your blood type can explain why you act the way you do. While that largely hasn’t been proven, one Japanese study found that some traits differed between blood groups. Keep in mind that the research linking blood type and health conditions looks at population studies, so it can only find an association—not that your blood type is the cause. “The risk for any one person is multifactorial,” notes Dr. Gernsheimer. Your blood type certainly doesn’t seal your fate when it comes to your health. Even though there are many ways your blood type can influence your health, “there isn’t good evidence that one’s lifestyle should be altered because of it,” says Dr. Gernsheimer. And it’s not up to you to have this info should you need a blood transfusion, she says. For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. History\n\nDiscovery\nThe ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). He wrote a two-sentence footnote:\n\nThis was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. Classification systems\n\nCzech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. These two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. Other developments\nThe first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. Genetics \n\nBlood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group. These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type:\n\nThe same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature. There are also variations in blood type distribution within human subpopulations. Both theories contradict the previously held theory that type O blood evolved first. The antibodies created against these environmental antigens in the first years of life can cross-react with ABO-incompatible red blood cells that it comes in contact with during blood transfusion later in life. Thus, individuals possessing rare types are better equipped to detect pathogens. Clinical relevance \nThe carbohydrate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells have roles in cell membrane integrity, cell adhesion, membrane transportation of molecules, and acting as receptors for extracellular ligands, and enzymes. ABO antigens are found having similar roles on epithelial cells as well as red blood cells. In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% of the total genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by the effect of the ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn \n\nABO blood group incompatibilities between the mother and child does not usually cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are usually of the IgM type, which do not cross the placenta. However, in an O-type mother, IgG ABO antibodies are produced and the baby can potentially develop ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn. Clinical applications \nIn human cells, the ABO alleles and their encoded glycosyltransferases have been described in several oncologic conditions. Using anti-GTA/GTB monoclonal antibodies, it was demonstrated that a loss of these enzymes was correlated to malignant bladder and oral epithelia. Furthermore, the expression of ABO blood group antigens in normal human tissues is dependent the type of differentiation of the epithelium. In most human carcinomas, including oral carcinoma, a significant event as part of the underlying mechanism is decreased expression of the A and B antigens. Several studies have observed that a relative down-regulation of GTA and GTB occurs in oral carcinomas in association with tumor development. More recently, a genome wide association study (GWAS) has identified variants in the ABO locus associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. Alteration of ABO antigens for transfusion \nIn April 2007, an international team of researchers announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O. This is done by using glycosidase enzymes from specific bacteria to strip the blood group antigens from red blood cells. The sort of blood is named \"enzyme converted to O\" (ECO) blood. Patient trials will be conducted before the method can be relied on in live situations. One such Phase II trial was done on B-to-O blood in 2002. Another approach to the blood antigen problem is the manufacture of artificial blood, which could act as a substitute in emergencies.

He was born and educated in York; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic. Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the Eighty Years' War against Protestant Dutch reformers in the Low Countries. On the evening of 4 November the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, where they discovered one of the plotters, Guy Fawkes, guarding a hoard of explosives. The following Monday, during the first search, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, noticed the huge pile of faggots in the corner of the cellar beneath the House of Lords. The king insisted that another search be made, and about midnight another party, this time led by Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet, discovered Fawkes and arrested him. News of Fawkes's capture soon spread throughout London, including the Strand, \n\n admitted to the plot, 25 March 1605, the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near. Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords.\n\nQuestion: Which King did Guy Fawkes attempt to kill with his gunpowder plot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Once he was \n\nDonald Eugene Harding (March 1, 1949 – April 6, 1992) was an American serial robber and spree killer who was convicted of the January 25, 1980 murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon. He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. Early life \nHarding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. Pre-Arizona criminal history \nHarding's first arrest occurred when he was 11 years old, when he was arrested for joyriding. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. Harding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Soon after his release, Harding was convicted in federal court for \"conspiracy to commit offense or defraud United States\" and was imprisoned again for five years. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder. Harding was in jail in Pulaski County when he escaped on September 17, 1979. He spent the rest of 1979 and part of 1980 carrying out a multi-state crime spree until his apprehension. Harding's crime spree began with the attempted robbery of a prostitute in Chicago, Illinois, on September 27; on December 10, he robbed and murdered Stanton Winston Blanton in Dallas, Texas, although he was never charged with this murder. On December 18, he robbed a man named Ronald Svetgoff and stole his car and identification cards, the latter of which he would use to feign his identity when he relocated to Arizona. On January 3, 1980, Harding drove a stolen car to South Lake Tahoe, California, where he broke into the hotel room belonging to 35-year-old Charles Dickerson; Harding robbed Dickerson and left him bound and gagged. By the time a hotel maid discovered Dickerson, he had suffocated to death. On January 10, 1980, a car that he stole from Joseph Wohlers broke down on U.S. Highway 101; when 39-year-old Gerald Huth, a Bloomington, Minnesota native who worked for Sperry Univac, stopped to help Harding, Harding shot Huth to death and stole his car. While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California. Arizona murders \nOn January 24, 1980, Harding fled to Phoenix, Arizona, where he gained entry to a hotel room belonging to 38-year-old gastroenterologist Allen F. Gage. Like Dickerson, Gage suffocated on the gag placed in his mouth. On January 25, 1980, Donald Harding posed as a security guard to gain entry into a motel room in Tucson, Arizona where Robert Wise, a businessman, was meeting with Martin Concannon, his corporation's sales representative. Upon entering the hotel room, Harding hogtied the two men, beat Wise with a wooden motel lamp, and stuffed socks into Concannon's mouth; afterwards, he shot both men in the head and chest. Once both men were critically injured, Harding stole Wise's briefcase, which contained his credit cards; he then took Concannon's Oldsmobile. He had missing teeth and jaw fractures from when Harding had bludgeoned him with the lamp, and Harding had shot him point-blank with a .25 caliber pistol once in the chest and once in the left temple. Authorities found Concannon's body in the hotel room's bathroom; he had also been shot in the chest and temple, and the bullet wound had also perforated his spinal cord, but Concannon's death was not instantaneous like Wise's death was; rather, medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the socks pushed to the back of his throat and obstructing his breathing passage, thereby suffocating him. The campus police officer then followed Harding, arrested him, and searched him, finding a .25 caliber pistol in one of his pockets, an identification card reading \"Security Guard,\" another identification card reading \"Special Officer,\" a Texas driver's license issued to a man named Ronald Gene Svetgoff, and an Oklahoma driver's license issued to the same man. At the time of his capture, the FBI office in Flagstaff announced that Harding was wanted for investigation in connection with a total of five murders, six kidnappings, 12 armed robberies, and four carjackings across Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Tennessee, and Texas. Harding was subsequently charged with the murders of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, and he was booked into the jail in Coconino County, Arizona. Harding chose to serve as his own counsel in this trial; a court also appointed a public defender to help Harding. Due to these threats, Harding was required to be restrained in leg irons during his trial. Sometime later, Harding was transferred to the Pima County Jail, where, in February, he attacked two guards. During Harding’s trial, deputy sheriffs cordoned off the first two rows of the courtroom’s viewing gallery to prevent Harding from being able to take a hostage. Harding was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Robert Wise and Martin Concannon, as well as the armed robberies and kidnappings of both men and the theft of Concannon’s car. On May 26, 1982, Harding's sentencing hearing took place. The board ultimately refused to recommend that then-Governor Fife Symington grant mercy in the form of a reprieve or commutation to life imprisonment. Martin Concannon's widow elected not to view the execution, but Warden Roger Crist, then-Attorney General Grant Woods, Harding's religious advisor, and six reporters were witnesses. When the chamber was sealed, a curtain was lifted to allow witnesses to look at Harding; Attorney General Woods claimed that Harding then looked at him and began yelling obscenities through the glass. Harding was the first person executed in Arizona after the death penalty moratorium imposed by the 1972 Furman v. Georgia ruling was lifted, and he was the first in the state since the 1963 gas chamber execution of Manuel Silvas. To date, he is the most recent person to be executed by cyanide gas in a gas chamber in the United States. The New York Times and Newsweek claimed Attorney General Woods became ill and vomited at the sight of Harding's convulsions. The Miami Herald article contended that certain aspects of Acosta's non-prosecution agreement violated federal law. Victims, former prosecutors, and the retired Palm Beach police chief were among those quoted criticizing the agreement and Acosta's role in it. In May 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in conjunction with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, arrested Varacalli for insurance fraud, extortion, and other charges. Varacalli's crew was responsible for the theft of about 600 auto airbags. In 2002, Varacalli was sentenced to 10 years in prison and received a $1 million fine. He was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Otisville, New York. On December 21, 2009 Varacalli was released from prison.\n\nQuestion: Why did Jason Alexander from Louisiana hit the headlines in January 2004?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age. The remaining individuals are the males, known as the “drones,” whose only responsibility is to mate with queen from another colony; therefore, drones are solely produced during the reproductive season. Greek bees generally tend to build up very quickly in the spring, with the queens being very prolific, resulting in strong hives. They also tend to make quite a lot of honey, but only in Mediterranean climates. Accompanying information about the history, social structure and science behind the world of bees and honey are conservation activities to make the world a place where hives of bees can thrive. In bumblebees, queens are the only ones capable of producing more queens.

Since its construction, the Byzantine imperial court made annual visits to the monastery on April 23, which was the feast day of Saint George.

Set in 1920s Shanghai, East China, Secrets of the Mogwai will tell the story of how 10-year-old Sam Wing met Gizmo, a young Mogwai. If the player has spent too much time killing gremlins, this often makes it impossible for Felix to go back for the oil in time. There is a warning 'flicker' as the oil reaches a low level but unless Felix is already on the conveyor belt with a can of oil, it will be too late. If Felix successfully tops up the generator with oil, the gremlins regenerate (and sometimes increase in number) and play begins again. In a prologue to Shadow in the Cloud, an animated training film from the United States Army Air Forces depicts the havoc a gremlin can produce for the unwary or complacent airman during wartime. When the film continues, the gremlin—a metaphor for problems caused by inattention and/or negligence—is depicted as a living, malevolent creature. A gremlin is a mischievous folkloric creature that causes malfunctions in aircraft or other machinery. Depictions of these creatures vary. Since World War II, different fantastical creatures have been referred to as gremlins, bearing varying degrees of resemblance to the originals. The term \"gremlin\", denoting a mischievous creature that sabotages aircraft, originates in Royal Air Force (RAF) slang among the British pilots stationed in Malta, the Middle East, and India in the 1920s, with the earliest recorded printed use being in a poem published in the journal Aeroplane in Malta on 10 April 1929.\n\nQuestion: According to the film Gremlins, if you are looking after a Gremlin you should not feed him after midnight, not get him wet and not expose him to what?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The term \"wine\" spanned a broad spectrum of wine-based beverages, the quality of which depended on the amount of pure grape juice used and how diluted the wine was when served. The finest wine was reserved for the upper classes of Rome. Below that was posca, a mixture of water and sour wine that had not yet turned into vinegar. Less acidic than vinegar, it still retained some of the aromas and texture of wine and was the preferred wine for the rations of Roman soldiers due to its \n\nSome examples of traditional foods that are made using bacteria include yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. In the case of vinegar production, bacteria are involved in the process of fermenting alcohol, usually derived from grapes or apples, into acetic acid. These bacteria convert the alcohol into acetic acid through a two-step fermentation process, resulting in the sour taste of vinegar. In summary, bacteria play a vital role in the production of traditional foods like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Their fermentation abilities contribute to the distinct flavors and textures of these products. In the culinary arts, vinegar is primarily used as a flavorful and acidic cooking ingredient. It adds tanginess and brightness to dishes and can be used in marinades, dressings, sauces, and soups. Balsamic vinegar, for example, is made from grape must and is known for its rich flavor and syrupy consistency. Malt vinegar is made from malted barley and has a distinctive malty taste. Overall, vinegar's versatility makes it a valuable ingredient both in cooking and various industrial settings. Rice vinegar is a vinegar made from fermented rice in East Asia (China, Japan and Korea), as well as in Vietnam in Southeast Asia. In Asia, vinegar is often called \"the best friend of Chinese herbs\" because it is frequently used to process herbal preparations. The historical origins of vinegar are not exactly known; it was probably discovered when our ancestors saw that wine exposed to the air turned sour, thereby creating vinegar.\n\nQuestion: Which English word comes from an old French word meaning sour wine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The American Samoa national team was then without a coach for two years before the appointment of Ian Crook in 2003. American Samoa have only won against Cook Islands and Tonga. As New Zealand and Australia had already qualified for the World Cup, Samoa and Fiji met in the playoff match with the winner gaining qualification to the World Cup and the loser to play against the winner of a match between Tonga and Papua New Guinea to earn a place in the repechage tournament. As a result, Fiji qualified for the World Cup, while Samoa awaited the winner of Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Tonga played Samoa to determine who advanced to the repechage tournament. Notes The OFC Nations Cup has often acted as part of the FIFA World Cup qualification process for Oceanian national teams and, as a result, American Samoa have competed in the qualifiers for both competitions in every edition since 1998. They have yet to qualify for either competition. As of December 2010 according to the FIFA World Rankings, American Samoa are ranked 203rd, or joint last, in the world of FIFA-sanctioned, international football.

The placenta also lacks a hemophagous area, a structure which aids in endocytosis and digestion of erythrocytes. The gestation period varies depending on climate, lasting 2–3 months in tropical areas, while lasting up to 5 months in temperate climates. At birth, this species weighs about 50% of the mother’s weight. The females fly, carrying their young, between roosts to keep them safe from predators. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by only a small number of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls. After arrival on shore, males fast for three months, and females fast for five weeks during mating and when nursing their pups. The gestation period is about 11 months. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression is more common in crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do \n\nPregnancy, also known as gestation, is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman's womb. A multiple pregnancy involves more than one offspring, such as with twins. Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures. A pregnancy may end in a live birth, a spontaneous miscarriage, an induced abortion, or a stillbirth. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is just over nine months (gestational age). When using fertilization age, the length is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following fertilization (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age), after which the term fetus is used until birth. Signs and symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods, tender breasts, morning sickness (nausea and vomiting), hunger, and frequent urination. Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters of approximately 3 months each. The first trimester includes conception, which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the Fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. During the first trimester, the possibility of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus) is at its highest. Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care, though babies born at this time will likely experience serious health complications such as heart and respiratory problems and long-term intellectual and developmental disabilities. Complications of pregnancy may include disorders of high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, iron-deficiency anemia, and severe nausea and vomiting. Babies born before 37 weeks are \"preterm\" and at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy. Babies born between weeks 37 and 39 are considered \"early term\" while those born between weeks 39 and 41 are considered \"full term\". Babies born between weeks 41 and 42 weeks are considered \"late term\" while after 42 weeks they are considered \"post term\". Delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons. About 213 million pregnancies occurred in 2012, of which, 190 million (89%) were in the developing world and 23 million (11%) were in the developed world. Terminology\n\nAssociated terms for pregnancy are gravid and parous. Gravidus and gravid come from the Latin word meaning \"heavy\" and a pregnant female is sometimes referred to as a gravida. Gravidity refers to the number of times that a female has been pregnant. A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a primigravida, and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a multigravida or as multiparous. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy more than 20 weeks are referred to as nulliparous. A pregnancy is considered term at 37 weeks of gestation. It is preterm if less than 37 weeks and postterm at or beyond 42 weeks of gestation. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended further division with early term 37 weeks up to 39 weeks, full term 39 weeks up to 41 weeks, and late term 41 weeks up to 42 weeks. Common signs and symptoms of pregnancy include:\n Tiredness\n Morning sickness\n Constipation\n Pelvic girdle pain\n Back pain\n Braxton Hicks contractions. It usually begins to fade several months after giving birth. Timeline\nThe chronology of pregnancy is, unless otherwise specified, generally given as gestational age, where the starting point is the beginning of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Sometimes, timing may also use the fertilization age which is the age of the embryo. Start of gestational age\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend the following methods to calculate gestational age:\n Directly calculating the days since the beginning of the last menstrual period. Early obstetric ultrasound, comparing the size of an embryo or fetus to that of a reference group of pregnancies of known gestational age (such as calculated from last menstrual periods), and using the mean gestational age of other embryos or fetuses of the same size. If the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period, it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy. In case of in vitro fertilization, calculating days since oocyte retrieval or co-incubation and adding 14 days. Trimesters\nPregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each lasting for approximately 3 months. The exact length of each trimester can vary between sources. The first trimester begins with the start of gestational age as described above, that is, the beginning of week 1, or 0 weeks + 0 days of gestational age (GA). It lasts until childbirth. Adding the estimated gestational age at childbirth to the above time point. Childbirth on average occurs at a gestational age of 280 days (40 weeks), which is therefore often used as a standard estimation for individual pregnancies. Naegele's rule is a standard way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age. Alternatively there are mobile apps, which essentially always give consistent estimations compared to each other and correct for leap year, while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year. A study of singleton live births came to the result that childbirth has a standard deviation of 14 days when gestational age is estimated by first trimester ultrasound, and 16 days when estimated directly by last menstrual period. Physiology\n\nInitiation\n\nThrough an interplay of hormones that includes follicle stimulating hormone that stimulates folliculogenesis and oogenesis creates a mature egg cell, the female gamete. Fertilization is the event where the egg cell fuses with the male gamete, spermatozoon. After the point of fertilization, the fused product of the female and male gamete is referred to as a zygote or fertilized egg. The fusion of female and male gametes usually occurs following the act of sexual intercourse. Pregnancy rates for sexual intercourse are highest during the menstrual cycle time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation. Fertilization can also occur by assisted reproductive technology such as artificial insemination and in vitro fertilisation. Fertilization usually occurs about two weeks before the next expected menstrual period. This is about a week to ten days after fertilization. Development of embryo and fetus\n\nThe sperm and the egg cell, which has been released from one of the female's two ovaries, unite in one of the two Fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg, known as a zygote, then moves toward the uterus, a journey that can take up to a week to complete. Cell division begins approximately 24 to 36 hours after the female and male cells unite. The development of the mass of cells that will become the infant is called embryogenesis during the first approximately ten weeks of gestation. During this time, cells begin to differentiate into the various body systems. By the end of the embryonic stage, the beginnings of features such as fingers, eyes, mouth, and ears become visible. Also during this time, there is development of structures important to the support of the embryo, including the placenta and umbilical cord. The placenta connects the developing embryo to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply. The umbilical cord is the connecting cord from the embryo or fetus to the placenta. After about ten weeks of gestational age—which is the same as eight weeks after conception—the embryo becomes known as a fetus. At the beginning of the fetal stage, the risk of miscarriage decreases sharply. At this stage, a fetus is about  in length, the heartbeat is seen via ultrasound, and the fetus makes involuntary motions. During continued fetal development, the early body systems, and structures that were established in the embryonic stage continue to develop. Sex organs begin to appear during the third month of gestation. The fetus continues to grow in both weight and length, although the majority of the physical growth occurs in the last weeks of pregnancy. Electrical brain activity is first detected between the fifth and sixth week of gestation. Synapses begin forming at 17 weeks, and begin to multiply quickly at week 28 until 3 to 4 months after birth. Although the fetus begins to move during the first trimester, it is not until the second trimester that movement, known as quickening, can be felt. This typically happens in the fourth month, more specifically in the 20th to 21st week, or by the 19th week if the woman has been pregnant before. It is common for some women not to feel the fetus move until much later. Maternal changes\n\nDuring pregnancy, a woman undergoes many physiological changes, which are entirely normal, including behavioral, cardiovascular, hematologic, metabolic, renal, and respiratory changes. The fetus is genetically different from its mother, and can be viewed as an unusually successful allograft. The main reason for this success is increased immune tolerance during pregnancy. During the first trimester, minute ventilation increases by 40%. The womb will grow to the size of a lemon by eight weeks. During the second trimester, most women feel more energized, and begin to put on weight as the symptoms of morning sickness subside and eventually fade away. The uterus, the muscular organ that holds the developing fetus, can expand up to 20 times its normal size during pregnancy. Braxton Hicks contractions  are sporadic uterine contractions that may start around six weeks into a pregnancy; however, they are usually not felt until the second or third trimester. The woman's abdomen will transform in shape as it drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth. During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen would have been upright, whereas in the third trimester it will drop down low. Fetal movement can become strong and be disruptive to the woman. The woman's navel will sometimes become convex, \"popping\" out, due to the expanding abdomen. Head engagement, also called \"lightening\" or \"dropping\", occurs as the fetal head descends into a cephalic presentation. In a first pregnancy it may happen a few weeks before the due date, though it may happen later or even not until labor begins, as is typical with subsequent pregnancies. It is also during the third trimester that maternal activity and sleep positions may affect fetal development due to restricted blood flow. A woman is considered to be in labour when she begins experiencing regular uterine contractions, accompanied by changes of her cervix—primarily effacement and dilation. During the time immediately after birth, both the mother and the baby are hormonally cued to bond, the mother through the release of oxytocin, a hormone also released during breastfeeding. Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both the mother and baby. A review done by the World Health Organization found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother–infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully. They recommend that neonates be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life. Childbirth maturity stages\n\nIn the ideal childbirth labor begins on its own when a woman is \"at term\". Events before completion of 37 weeks are considered preterm. Sometimes if a woman's water breaks or she has contractions before 39 weeks, birth is unavoidable. However, spontaneous birth after 37 weeks is considered term and is not associated with the same risks of a preterm birth. This is from factors including underdeveloped lungs of newborns, infection due to underdeveloped immune system, feeding problems due to underdeveloped brain, and jaundice from underdeveloped liver. Babies born between 39 and 41 weeks' gestation have better outcomes than babies born either before or after this range. Whenever possible, waiting for labor to begin on its own in this time period is best for the health of the mother and baby. Events after 42 weeks are considered postterm. When a pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks, the risk of complications for both the woman and the fetus increases significantly. Therefore, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, obstetricians usually prefer to induce labour at some stage between 41 and 42 weeks. Postnatal period\n\nThe postpartum period also referred to as the puerperium, is the postnatal period that begins immediately after delivery and extends for about six weeks. During this period, the mother's body begins the return to pre-pregnancy conditions that includes changes in hormone levels and uterus size. This condition is known as a false pregnancy. These signs include:\n the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood and urine\n missed menstrual period\n implantation bleeding that occurs at implantation of the embryo in the uterus during the third or fourth week after last menstrual period\n increased basal body temperature sustained for over 2 weeks after ovulation\n Chadwick's sign (darkening of the cervix, vagina, and vulva)\n Goodell's sign (softening of the vaginal portion of the cervix)\n Hegar's sign (softening of the uterus isthmus)\n Pigmentation of the linea alba – linea nigra, (darkening of the skin in a midline of the abdomen, caused by hyperpigmentation resulting from hormonal changes, usually appearing around the middle of pregnancy). Ultrasound\n\nObstetric ultrasonography can detect fetal abnormalities, detect multiple pregnancies, and improve gestational dating at 24 weeks. The resultant estimated gestational age and due date of the fetus are slightly more accurate than methods based on last menstrual period. A basic prenatal visit consists of measurement of blood pressure, fundal height, weight and fetal heart rate, checking for symptoms of labor, and guidance for what to expect next. The neural tube develops during the first 28 days of pregnancy, a urine pregnancy test is not usually positive until 14 days post-conception, explaining the necessity to guarantee adequate folate intake before conception. Developing infants cannot produce DHA efficiently, and must receive this vital nutrient from the woman through the placenta during pregnancy and in breast milk after birth. Unpasteurized dairy and deli meats may contain Listeria, which can cause neonatal meningitis, stillbirth and miscarriage. Pregnant women are also more prone to Salmonella infections, can be in eggs and poultry, which should be thoroughly cooked. Cat feces and undercooked meats may contain the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and can cause toxoplasmosis. Weight gain is related to the weight of the baby, the placenta, extra circulatory fluid, larger tissues, and fat and protein stores. The Institute of Medicine recommends an overall pregnancy weight gain for those of normal weight (body mass index of 18.5–24.9), of 11.3–15.9 kg (25–35 pounds) having a singleton pregnancy. During pregnancy, insufficient or excessive weight gain can compromise the health of the mother and fetus. Conditions of particular severity in pregnancy include mercury poisoning and lead poisoning. Most research suggests that during pregnancy both sexual desire and frequency of sexual relations decrease. Pregnancy alters the vaginal flora with a reduction in microscopic species/genus diversity. However, they write that more recent information suggests that in the uncomplicated pregnancy, fetal injuries are highly unlikely. Also a pyogenic granuloma or \"pregnancy tumor\", is commonly seen on the labial surface of the papilla. Flying\nIn low risk pregnancies, most health care providers approve flying until about 36 weeks of gestational age. These are the leading cause of death in pregnant women in the US. Ectopic pregnancy, including abdominal pregnancy, implantation of the embryo outside the uterus\n Hyperemesis gravidarum, excessive nausea and vomiting that is more severe than normal morning sickness. Risks for the child include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, large for gestational age (macrosomia), polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid), and birth defects. Untreated celiac disease can cause a miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age, low birthweight and preterm birth. Complications or failures of pregnancy cannot be explained simply by malabsorption, but by the autoimmune response elicited by the exposure to gluten, which causes damage to the placenta. Pregnancy itself is a factor of hypercoagulability (pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability), as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent postpartum bleeding. Of pregnancies in 2012, 120 million occurred in Asia, 54 million in Africa, 19 million in Europe, 18 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 7 million in North America, and 1 million in Oceania. In Western, Northern, and Southern Europe, first-time mothers are on average 26 to 29 years old, up from 23 to 25 years at the start of the 1970s. Asia, Japan and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise, and increasingly the process is spreading to countries in the developing world like China, Turkey and Iran. Society and culture\n\nIn most cultures, pregnant women have a special status in society and receive particularly gentle care. Overall, pregnancy is accompanied by numerous customs that are often subject to ethnological research, often rooted in traditional medicine or religion. Among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric figurines found across much of Eurasia and collectively known as Venus figurines. Some of these appear to be pregnant. Infertility\n\nModern reproductive medicine offers many forms of assisted reproductive technology for couples who stay childless against their will, such as fertility medication, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization and surrogacy. When carried out by choice, it is usually within the first trimester, sometimes in the second, and rarely in the third. According to studies, congenital defects, SIDS, preterm birth, and low birth weight are all more common among African American babies.

Mating takes place in short periods throughout the rainy season in December. Afterwards, both males and females go their separate ways and return to their solitary lives once more. Young are raised solely by the females. Gestation lasts around two months (63 days). Weaning takes place between 45 and 60 days, with the young reaching full maturity around one year of age. Gestation lasts roughly six months, ending in parturition, which normally occurs during June or July. Typically, females give birth to one or two young. The newborns weigh about 500 g, and have spots. The young are cared for by their mother after birth for several months, until weaning occurs. At six months, the young have typically reached full adult size. Sexual maturity, however, does not occur until roughly 18 months. Not much is known about black musk deer parental care. Females are generally the main caretakers, as they watch their young for roughly 3 to 4 months. Typically, the young travel with their mothers throughout this period, during which the mother defends and grooms her young.\n\nQuestion: Which animal has the longest gestation period at around 22 months?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Water is the most important part of the beaver habitat. Beavers also prefer wider streams over narrower ones. Dams impound water and lodges serve as shelters. Their infrastructure creates wetlands used by many other species, and because of their effect on other organisms in the ecosystem, they are considered a keystone species. Beavers hold territories and mark them using scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum, a \n\n ice on the lodge. It has been hypothesized that beavers' canals are not only transportation routes but an extension of their \"central place\" around the lodge and/or food cache. In some areas, the presence of certain species (such as beavers) can be beneficial for flood control reasons. Beavers build and maintain beaver dams which will reduce the height of flood waves moving down the river (during periods of heavy rains), and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures, at the cost of minor flooding near the dams (often on farmland). Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the home of a beaver?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Pilbara ningaui is considered to be of similar size and weight. The gestation period is about 20–30 days, and the young remain in the pouch for five months. When leaving the pouch, they weigh between 3.5 and 6.5 kg. The joey is weaned around 12 to 15 months of age, and is usually independent at 18 months of age. At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother. As a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. The majority of the young are born between May and July.

Released on October 4, 1994 by Elektra, it is Cole's first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to Take a Look (1993). Holly & Ivy spawned one single \"No More Blue Christmas\". \"The Holly and the Ivy\" is a traditional British folk Christmas carol, listed as number 514 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The song can be traced only as far as the early nineteenth century, but the lyrics reflect an association between holly and Christmas dating at least as far as medieval times. The version which is now popular was collected in 1909 by the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp in the market town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, from a woman named Mary Clayton. An early mention of the carol's title occurs in William Hone's 1823 work Ancient Mysteries Described, which includes \"The holly and the ivy, now are both well grown\" among an alphabetical list of \"Christmas Carols, now annually printed\" that were in the author's possession. The complete words of the carol are found in a book review dating from 1849, in which the reviewer suggested using the text of \"The Holly and the Ivy\" in place of one of the readings found in the book under discussion. Some traditional recordings have been made which demonstrate this melodic variety; these include one sung by Peter Jones of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, and another performed by Bessie Wallace of Camborne, Cornwall in the early 1930s and recorded by James Madison Carpenter, which is publicly available on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. The \"Sans Day Carol\", considered a variant of the song, is associated with a different tune. The words of the carol were included in Sylvester's 1861 collection A Garland of Christmas Carols where it is claimed to originate from \"an old broadside, printed a century and a half since\" [i.e. around 1711]: Husk's 1864 Songs of the Nativity also includes the carol, stating: \"This carol appears to have nearly escaped the notice of collectors, as it has been reprinted by one alone, who states his copy to have been taken from \"an old broadside, printed a century and a half since,\" i.e.\n\nQuestion: Which Christmas song includes the line It seems so long since I could say 'sister Susie sitting on a thistle'?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After \"Taxman\" and \"Love You To\", it was the third Harrison composition recorded for Revolver.

I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, \"I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me.\" The lyric concerns a man's entreaties to his girlfriend's young siblings not to reveal his courtship of their elder sister and to leave them alone, at some points, even bribing them with things like \"candy and a quarter\" and \"a movie\", on the condition that they \"keep a secret\".

In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Chancellor Nigel Lawson forced Thatcher to agree to the \"Madrid Conditions\", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM \"when the time was right\". In July 1989, she retaliated by removing Howe from the Foreign Office, while making him Deputy Prime Minister (in theory a promotion but in \n\n Winston Churchill was made Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924 by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and served until 1929, presenting five budgets. Churchill's other policies as Chancellor included free trade, a reduction in the rate of local taxation, lowering the pension age and support for coal miners and the mining industry. however, he praised Churchill's sense of humour, his vitality, his loyalty and greatest of all his oratory – \"a tower of debating strength in the House of Commons\". 1979, when Labour lost the general election to the Conservatives and Margaret Thatcher became Britain's first female prime minister. The announcement of the Community Charge (often referred to as the Poll Tax) during 1989 and the onset of a recession shortly before Thatcher's resignation had seen Tory support plunge in the opinion polls, most of which were showing a double-digit Labour lead and making it seem likely that Neil Kinnock would be the next Prime Minister.

Many species are having edible fruits. Others swallow the fruit and pass the seed intact through the gut. An incomplete list of birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diet include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan. The fruits are an important food source for Palaeognathae highly dependent. Seed dispersal of various species in the genus is also carried out by fishes and big and small mammals as Pachyderms, Bovids, monkeys, arboreal rodents, porcupines, or possums. Firstly, they play a crucial role in controlling insects. This helps in the regeneration of forests and the growth of diverse plant populations. Bats also play a significant role in pollination. They transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing for the reproduction of numerous plant species, including economically important ones like bananas, mangoes, and agave (used for tequila production). It is important to note that while bats offer these benefits, they are also associated with the transmission of zoonotic diseases. In summary, bats provide essential ecosystem services, including insect control, forest reseeding, and plant pollination. Their guano is a valuable resource with various applications. The nose-leaf are erect and shaped like a lace with a tan coloration. The ears pointed and go from light to dark brown, starting from the base of the ear and to the top of the ears. The eyes are small and oval shaped with brown iris and a circular pupils.

One distinguishing feature is the presence of mammary glands, which are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk. Another unique characteristic of placental mammals is the presence of hair or fur, which helps protect them against extreme cold. Placental mammals also have a middle ear that contains three bones, allowing them to transmit sound vibrations into nerve impulses. Unlike other vertebrates, placental mammals have a lower jaw consisting of only a single bone on each side. Additionally, placental mammals are warm-blooded (endothermic) and have specialized or differentiated teeth. They possess a larger brain, particularly the neocortex, which is the most advanced brain area. Placental mammals also have a diaphragm, a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity, and an efficient four-chambered heart. It is worth noting that humans, as primates, are classified as placental mammals. These unique characteristics collectively contribute to the successful adaptation and diversity of placental mammals. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796).The first true mammals made their appearance some 200 million years ago and, over the course of tens of millions of years, diverged into three branches: The monotremes are egg-laying mammals, such as the duckbilled platypus, found only in Australia and New Guinea. Ninety percent of all mammals are placental (eutherians), in which the fetus is carried in the womb until birth at which time it is at an advanced stage of development. Humans are placental mammals classified as **primates**. Mammals have a number of unique characteristics not shared by other vertebrates: Mammary glands are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk, the offspring's primary source of nutrition. (In 1758, Linnaeus named these animals _mammals_ , from the Latin = \"breast.\") Hair or fur, present at some time during life, protects mammals against extreme cold. Other characteristics, although not necessarily unique to mammals, include being warm-blooded (endothermic) and having specialized or differentiated teeth, a larger brain (in particular, the neocortex, the most advanced brain area), a diaphragm (a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity), and an efficient four-chambered heart. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796). This 1937 poster promoted infant nursing.Since then, the practice has increased, and experts recommend it for at least the first six months of infant life.# Birds\n\n**Charles Darwin** (1809–1882)\n\n# c. 150 Million BCE\n\nThere are some 10,000 species of living birds on all continents that have the common characteristics of being feathered, winged, bipedal, warm-blooded, and egg-laying. Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. The process of feeding milk in all animals (including humans) is called nursing, and in humans it is also called breastfeeding. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as witch's milk. In most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function. Oxytocin is critical for the milk let-down reflex in response to suckling. The costly investment of energy and resources into milk is outweighed by the benefit to offspring survival. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility (in humans, lactational amenorrhea), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring. After birth, oxytocin contracts the smooth muscle layer of band-like cells surrounding the alveoli to squeeze the newly produced milk into the duct system. It is also possible to induce lactation without pregnancy through combinations of birth control pills, galactagogues, and milk expression using a breast pump. Thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast. Milk ejection is initiated in the mother's breast by the act of suckling by the baby. The milk ejection reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. The release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the milk ejection or let-down reflex. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region. If this is true then milk simply enters the lactiferous ducts), and then out the nipple. It appears plausible that the possibility of lactation in women (or females of other species) who are not biological mothers does confer an evolutionary advantage, especially in groups with high maternal mortality and tight social bonds. The phenomenon has been also observed in most primates, in some lemurs, and in dwarf mongooses. Evolution \n\nCharles Darwin recognized that mammary glands seemed to have developed specifically from cutaneous glands, and hypothesized that they evolved from glands in brood pouches of fish, where they would provide nourishment for eggs. The latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed; however, more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early synapsids. As all mammals lactate, lactation must have evolved before the last common ancestor of all mammals, which places it at a minimum in the Middle or Late Triassic when monotremes diverged from therians. O. T. Oftedal has argued that therapsids evolved a proto-lacteal fluid in order to keep eggs moist, an adaption necessitated due to diapsids parchment shelled eggs which are more vulnerable to evaporation and dehydration than the mineralized eggs produced by some sauropsids. [20] The evolution of lactation is also believed to have resulted in the more complex dentition seen in mammals, as lactation would have allowed the prolonged development of the jaw before the eruption of teeth. During early evolution of lactation, the secretion of milk was through pilosebaceous glands on mammary patches, analogous to the areola, and hairs on this patch transported the nourishing fluids to the hatchlings as is seen in monotremes. The development of the nipple occurred in the mammal lineages that diverged after monotremes, metatheria and eutheria. Occurrence outside Mammalia\n\nAnother well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the crop milk of columbiform birds. Like in mammals, this also appears to be directed by prolactin. A closer examination reveals that, as in mammals and birds, the secretion of this nourishing fluid may be controlled by prolactin. Lactation is also the hallmark of adenotrophic viviparity - a breeding mechanism developed by some insects, most notably tsetse flies. The single egg of the tsetse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk gland inside the uterus. This form of lactation may have evolved from production of trophic eggs.

Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.\n\nQuestion: Apart from being warm blooded and giving birth to live young, what do mammals produce to differentiate them from other families of animals?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail. Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry. Meanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works \n\n Guido, a Milanese who has relocated to Naples, is a somewhat romantic teacher of Italian literature. Guido immediately falls wildly in love with her, as she embodies all the qualities he wants in a woman. Meanwhile, Giada, another neighbor who recently lost her husband, is madly in love with Guido but contents herself with eavesdropping on him through the wall that separates their apartments, rather than approaching him. In 1922, during Fascism, Antonio La Quaglia accepts the assignment to the station master in a remote town called Piovarolo, because that's where it always rains. Mario writes a letter but never gets any reply. Several months later, he receives a letter from Neruda. While there Mario comes upon an old phonograph and listens to the song he first heard when he met Neruda. Moved, he makes recordings of all the beautiful sounds on the island onto a cassette including the heartbeat of his \n\n  Chile's most famous contributions to literature have come from Nobel Prize poets Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral, whose homes and birthplaces are now museums that attract literary pilgrims to Chile. The increasingly popular Luis Sepúlveda wrote stylish short novels like The Old Man Who Read Love Stories, and combined travel writing with imaginative fiction in Full Circle: a South American Journey. José Donoso's novel Curfew recalls the latter days of the recent military dictatorship, while Antonio Skármeta's novel Burning Patience (drawing on Neruda's life as a Chilean icon) was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning Italian film, Il Postino (The Postman).\n\nQuestion: To which poet does Il Postino deliver mail?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist's dream come true\". The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Albert Einstein: Albert Einstein &ndash; deceased German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921. He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.\n\nQuestion: Which scientist was Time magazine's \"Person of the 20th Century\"?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ruddy began his career at Cambridge United, before signing for Everton as a 19-year-old. Ruddy was signed by Paul Lambert to play for Norwich City in 2010 and, in his first season, was part of the team that finished second in the Championship, gaining promotion to the Premier League. The following year, Norwich finished twelfth in the Premier League, and Ruddy was selected by new England manager Roy Hodgson for the squad for Euro 2012. After 243 appearances for Norwich, he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2017. After Bond's resignation he took caretaker charge of the team until the appointment of Sol Campbell. He stated \"I had to sacrifice some things but I'm here to play football again and I'm here to prove a point. I'm very happy to be here, it's a great club – and I'm sure I'll do well here.\" West Ham chairman David Sullivan announced that in order for Mido to secure his long-term footballing future, his contract with West Ham put him amongst the lowest earners in the Premier League. As a left back, Powell played for Southend United, Derby County, Charlton Athletic, West Ham United, Watford and Leicester City. The season began with the arrival of two notable new players, striker Nigel Clough and defender Neil Ruddock.

The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. In the 1970s Ducati began producing motorcycles with large-displacement V-twin engines, which Ducati branded as \"L-twin\" fort their 90° angle, and in 1973, introduced their trademarked desmodromic valve design. The Scrambler bikes' engines and frames are made at Ducati's Borgo Panigale, Italy, factory and then shipped to Thailand for final assembly. As \n\n The Ducati Scrambler is an V-twin engined standard or roadster motorcycle made by Ducati. The Ducati 899 Panigale is a 898 cc sport bike from Ducati, released in 2013 to replace the 848. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The unconventional decision to use a two-sided swingarm on a superbike from Ducati was made because of the substantial upgrades added to the bike including electronically adjustable anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic braking control, and a quickshifter.

On 8 December 2016, Rooney signed a 28-day loan deal with National League club Torquay United. On 24 January 2018, Rooney signed for League Two side Colchester United on a one-and-a-half year deal. Lukaku's signing came a day after former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney left the club to return to Everton, Rooney's boyhood club. As a player, he set the all-time goalscoring record for Manchester United and England, which was later broken by another United player (Wayne Rooney) and his appearance record was unbroken for 35 years after his last game for United, while his England record was not broken until 2015, by the same United player (Wayne Rooney) as he scored his 50th England goal. For example, the 2004 transfer of Wayne Rooney from Everton to Manchester United cost an initial fee of £20 million that rose to £27 million due to the number of appearances he made and the number of trophies he won with the club. He signed a five-year deal with the club. He was handed the number 18 shirt previously worn by Paul Scholes. He made his debut for United in a 3–2 derby win over Manchester City in the 2011 FA Community Shield, playing the full 90 minutes and making an assist. He made his league debut for United against West Bromwich Albion on 14 August 2011, setting up the first goal for Wayne Rooney and forcing an own goal after a run down the left flank and cross, in a 2–1 away win.\n\nQuestion: Wayne Rooney signed for Manchester United from which other Premiership Club?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Along the northern border with China runs the Yalu River and the Tumen River. In between the rivers, and the source of both, is Paektu Mountain, revered by both the Koreans and Manchurians as the mythic origin of each people. The worst hunger of the 1990s famine years occurred in these three provinces, and most refugees into China come from the Rust Belt region. The Yellow Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean located between mainland China and the Korean Peninsula, and can be considered the northwestern part of the East China Sea. The innermost bay of northwestern Yellow Sea is called the Bohai Sea (previously Pechihli Bay or Chihli Bay), into which flow some of the most important rivers of northern China, such as the Yellow River (through Shandong province and its capital Jinan), the Hai River (through Beijing and Tianjin) and the Liao River (through Liaoning province). The northern extension of the Yellow Sea is called the Korea Bay, into which flow the Yalu River, the Chongchon River and the Taedong River. The peninsula is located in Northeast Asia, between China and Japan. To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia. The Yellow Sea lies to the west, the East China Sea and Korea Strait to the south, and the Sea of Japan to the east. It is the largest Chinese border city, facing Sinuiju, North Korea across the Yalu River, which demarcates the Sino-North Korean border. Dandong has therefore had a dynamic history because of its strategic location for the northeast's rich natural resources and because of its convenient access to the ocean.\n\nQuestion: The Yalu river forms a sort of natural border between China and which of its neighbours?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The remaining contestants stand at a line of podiums, each equipped with a button, and are offered a cash buyout to quit the game ($2,500 on the first challenge, $5,000 on the second, $7,500 on the third). Total Wipeout is a British game show, hosted by Richard Hammond and Amanda Byram, which first aired on the BBC on 3 January 2009. In each episode, contestants competed in a series of challenges in an attempt to win £10,000. These challenges were based in large pools of water or mud and generally involved large assault courses that contestants had to cross. These were gradually eliminated over four rounds until one contestant remained, who won a £10,000 cash prize and a trophy. In the summer of 2020, Top Gear presenters Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness hosted a six-episode best-of series, featuring the presenters narrating classic episodes of the show, called Total Wipeout: Freddie and Paddy Takeover. One of the first such programs in the United States was Information Please in 1938, and one of the first major successes was Dr. I.Q. Winner Take All, a Goodson-Todman Production which premiered in 1946, was the first to use lock-out devices and feature returning champions. A variant of the quiz show, the giveaway show, appeared in 1948 when the ABC Radio Network introduced Stop the Music, in which people randomly called by telephone and members of a studio audience would identify music to win prizes provided \n\n Jeopardy! In each episode, between 100 and 142 contestants attempted to pass a series of wacky and near-impossible physical challenges to reach the Show Down at the castle against Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano for a chance to win large cash prizes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers - and also coined the term \"Keshi Heads\" to describe fans of the show.\n\nQuestion: Name the game show, presented by Leslie Grantham and Melinda Messenger, where contestants were set physical and mental challenges?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1999, Hancock was replaced as host by Paul Merton (who was also the first ever guest on the original radio version). Merton's first guest was Nick Hancock and his last was his fellow regular team captain on Have I Got News for You, Ian Hislop. Following Merton's departure in 2007, it was announced that a replacement would be sought; however, it was not until 2012 that a twelfth series, now fronted by Frank Skinner, was aired. In 1982, he presented the regional variety program Six Tonight from BTV-6 in Ballarat and the daytime talent show Pot Luck in 1987.

However, this was challenged in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, which described light as discrete and localized quanta of energy (now called photons), which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.

Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. It was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 on 3 January 1986, and was given the temporary designation S/1986 U 1. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell, it is named for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Shakespeare's The Tempest. Both Ariel and the slightly larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, claimed to have observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.

Many episodes see RoboCop's reputation put to the test or soured by interventions from Dr. McNamara, the creator of ED-260, the upgradable version of the Enforcement Droid Series 209 and the top competitor for the financial backing of OCP. In 2044, Jacq Vaucan—an insurance investigator for ROC, the company that manufactures Pilgrims—investigates a report from Wallace, a police officer who shot a robot he claims was modifying itself. As Jacq looks for a robot they suspect was stealing parts, it leads him outside the city. In this futuristic setting there is only one known city left in the world, and it is run by ChaoSonic. However, when half the hit-men in Europe start gunning for them, things get complicated quickly. As Cane races the clock, the police, and the assassins across France and Switzerland, whom can he trust? Maganhard's alcoholic and troubled bodyguard? Or his former Resistance contacts, who might or might not sell him out for the highest price? Using elements from both the RoboCop and Terminator universes, the comic book series begins with Skynet sending three Terminators back in time to Detroit to protect a troubled RoboCop from a lone human soldier also sent back to destroy him. Part of the story focuses on his mind, the only part left of him, hiding and moving throughout Skynet's systems, fighting back as best he can. RoboCop's human consciousness (Alex Murphy) waits for decades in hiding deep within Skynet's \"consciousness\", avoiding detection as the slaughter of humanity takes place.\n\nQuestion: Who was part man, part machine, all cop and hailed from a futuristic Detroit?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is the first novel of the original Bourne Trilogy, which also includes The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. Peter Cannon of Publishers Weekly named The Bourne Identity among the best spy novels of all time, after John le Carré's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The novel was the basis for the scripts of the 1988 television movie of the same name starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith, and the 2002 film of the same name, starring Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper. It is preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and followed by The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016). The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. The Bourne Legacy is a 2004 spy fiction thriller written by Eric Van Lustbader. He has also written other novels in the series, The Bourne Betrayal, The Bourne Sanction, The Bourne Deception, The Bourne Objective, The Bourne Dominion, The Bourne Imperative, The Bourne Retribution, The Bourne Ascendancy, The Bourne Enigma, The Bourne Initiative and The Bourne Nemesis. The Bourne Ultimatum is a 2007 American action-thriller film directed by Paul Greengrass loosely based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum. The fourth film, The Bourne Legacy, was released in August 2012, without the involvement of Damon, and the fifth film (a direct sequel to Ultimatum), Jason Bourne, was released in July 2016. George Nolfi, who co-wrote the screenplay for the Bourne Ultimatum film, was to write the screenplay for a fourth film. On June 9, 2010, it was announced that Tony Gilroy would be writing and directing a movie entitled The Bourne Legacy that would have a 2012 release date.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the Bourne trilogy of books, made into movies starring Matt Damon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They are visited by wise men who bring gifts to the newborn Messiah. Although this story may not present a historically accurate account of Jesus' life, it does use a fiction about Jesus to communicate an important truth about the Rabbis. Moreover, Rubenstein sees this story as a rebuke to overly harsh Rabbis. Boyarin suggests that the Rabbis were well aware of Christian views of the Pharisees and that this story acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus was forgiving and the Pharisees were not (see Mark 2:1–2), while emphasizing forgiveness as a necessary Rabbinic value. Similarly, while it is widely accepted that there is a connection with Zoroastrian (Persian) sources underlying Matthew's story of the Magi (the wise men from the East) and the Star of Bethlehem, a wider claim that Zoroastrianism formed the background to the infancy narratives has not achieved acceptance. The magi, dispatched by King Herod, have found the infant Jesus and in this verse present him with gifts in an event known as the Visit of the Wise Men.\n\nQuestion: The Bible tells of 3 wise men visiting Jesus after his birth, but in which of the Gospels does this appear?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth \"finger\". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”). ; The drawer sign: ; The examiner stands behind the dog and places a thumb on the caudal aspect of the femoral condylar region with the index finger on the patella.

Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables. Cable ties were first invented by Thomas & Betts, an electrical company, in 1958 under the brand name Ty-Rap. Initially they were designed for airplane wire harnesses. The original design used a metal tooth, and these can still be obtained. Manufacturers later changed to the nylon/plastic design. Ty-Rap cable tie inventor, Maurus C. Logan, worked for Thomas & Betts and finished his career with the company as Vice President of Research and Development. When bobbinet is woven with spots, it is called point d'esprit. Tie clips are commonly made of metal and often have decorative patterns or embellishments. Some clips have a small badge indicating membership to a club or some other affiliation, or some other commemorative token, in a similar manner to the way in which ties themselves may be used as signs of membership. An aiguillette (, from aiguille, \"needle\"), also spelled aguillette, aiglet or aglet, is a cord with metal tips or lace tags, or the decorative tip itself.

Rooney was later nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, but lost to Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas. Many pundits had tipped Everton for relegation that season: having escaped relegation from the Premier League by six points the previous season, Everton's task to stay in English football's top flight only seemed harder after the multimillion-pound transfer of teenage striker Wayne Rooney to Manchester United after setting the summer's European Championships alight. However, the season turned out to be Everton's most successful in Premier League history as they placed fourth in the league with 61pts. Everton kept pace with the likes of Chelsea (95pts) and Arsenal (83pts) at the Premier League summit for the first half of the season, finishing 2004 only a few points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Striker Niall Quinn and wingers David Rocastle and Martin Hayes both became regular members of the first team this season, with Hayes finishing as Arsenal's top scorer with 24 goals. Everton then won their first league game at home in over three months as James McCarthy opened the scoring with his first goal of the year against Newcastle United and further strikes from Lukaku and Ross Barkley completed a 3–0 victory. The consequent corner broke to Rooney on the edge of the penalty area, but his shot was deflected behind for another corner, which Scholes took. The England midfielder floated the ball over to the edge of the penalty area, where Rooney was waiting, only to volley it just over the bar. In the closing stages of the first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball trickling along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably.

This is a tale of international intrigue and espionage, therefore opening up the possibility of more spy fiction from Christie. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. One of Doyle's early short stories, \"J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement\" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste. When their mother disappears, Enola's brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, decide to send her to a finishing school against her will. Instead, with the aid of her mother who had provided hidden funds and an elaborate cipher for her daughter to communicate with her, Enola runs away to London where she establishes a clandestine private detective career specializing in \n\n Through China's Golden Age of crime fiction (1900–1949), translations of Western classics, and native Chinese detective fictions circulated within the country. Cheng Xiaoqing had first encountered Conan Doyle's highly popular stories as an adolescent. This style began China's interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, Sherlock in Shanghai. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle's style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction. Doyle pursued an education in the medical field,where he began writing short stories. Conan Doyle published The Sign of Four in 1890, which established Sherlock Holmes as a prominent character and did wonders in putting Conan Doyle on the map literature map in the United Kingdom and United States.

While all of these activities are fun, Dr. John Cho, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Straub Medical Center, shares some knowledge on how to prevent and treat common water-induced ear diagnoses like surfer’s ear, swimmer’s ear and perforated ear drums. Some symptoms of swimmer’s ear can include redness, itchiness, pain, temporary hearing loss and pus-like fluid draining from the ear. Wear customized ear plugs in the water. Visit an ear, nose and throat specialist for periodic cleaning. This combination encourages bony developments to grow in the ear, therefore restricting the ear canal. Wetsuits do not protect the ears. Wear swim caps or neoprene hoods in the water. A perforated ear drum can happen in water sports when traumatic forces act upon the ear. For example, if an ear is slapped by a wave, the pressure could cause the ear drum to rupture, which makes it more susceptible to infection. However, having an ear, nose and throat specialist monitor the status of the ruptured ear drum is extremely important to ensure the ear is healing properly. The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth. A snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving mask. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for underwater activities such as spearfishing, freediving, finswimming, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and for surface breathing with scuba equipment. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a mouthpiece at the lower end and constructed of light metal, rubber or plastic. The snorkel may come with a rubber loop or a plastic\n\nQuestion: In which sport or pastime can you see nose walking?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The two most common types of \"glaucoma tests\" performed during a routine eye exam are non-contact tonometry and applanation tonometry. In non-contact tonometry (NCT), an instrument emits a quick puff of air toward the surface of your eye. Nothing but air touches your cornea. The \"gold standard\" method for measuring eye pressure is called applanation tonometry. In applanation tonometry, the instrument that measures your IOT has a small sensor that gently touches the surface of your eye. Who is most at risk for glaucoma? Is there any way to prevent glaucoma? Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma. Vision loss from glaucoma cannot be reversed. If the drops don't work, surgery may be the next step. Can marijuana be used to treat glaucoma? The possible use of marijuana for the management of glaucoma has been debated for years. However, the current consensus among clinicians is that medical marijuana needs further research as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma, and that it currently does not appear to be as effective as FDA-approved glaucoma medications and treatments. People being treated for glaucoma typically are not good candidates for LASIK. This is because a suction device is used on the eye during the creation of the corneal flap during LASIK surgery, and this briefly causes a significant increase in IOP. But you might be a candidate for another type of vision correction surgery, such as PRK, which does not require the use of a suction device. At Executive Park Eye Care, our eye doctors will perform a glaucoma test as part of your comprehensive eye exam. Who is at high risk for Glaucoma? What happens during a Glaucoma Eye Exam in Colorado Springs, CO? After your eye is numbed with eye drops, a tonometer is used to measure intraocular pressure (IOP). For the best preventive care – contact us to schedule your eye exam and glaucoma test in our optometry practice in Colorado Springs. What are some Glaucoma Treatments offered by eye doctors in Colorado Springs? The current goal of all glaucoma treatments is to lower or stabilize the pressure in your eye, which will hopefully prevent damage to your optic nerve. The first line of defense is typically medicated eye drops. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Palpation is one of the oldest, simplest, and least expensive methods for approximate IOP measurement. A newer transpalpebral and transscleral tonometry method is not influenced by corneal biomechanics and does not need to be adjusted for corneal irregularities as measurement is done over upper eyelid and sclera. Tonometry is a technique used by eye care professionals to measure the intraocular pressure (IOP), which refers to the fluid pressure inside the eye. It plays a crucial role in evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma. There are different types of tonometers available, but most are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The specific method used may vary depending on the equipment and technique employed by the eye care professional. One common type of tonometry is called applanation tonometry, which involves gently touching the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) with a small probe or device. This allows for an accurate measurement of IOP based on how much force is needed to flatten a small area of the cornea. Another type is non-contact tonometry, also known as air-puff tonometry. In this method, a quick puff of air is directed towards the cornea while a sensor measures changes in reflection or indentation caused by the air puff. Overall, tonometry serves as an essential tool for evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma because it allows eye care professionals to measure intraocular pressure accurately.\n\nQuestion: In which occupation would you rotate the gog at the end of your nose?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Visually Impaired (VI): Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment and the athlete with visual impairment are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates. Boccia can be played by individuals, pairs, or teams of three. The aim of the game is to throw leather balls – coloured red or blue (which side gets which is determined by a coin toss) – as close as they can to a white target ball, or jack. The jack is thrown first, then the first two regular balls are played, (first, the player who threw the jack then the opposing side), after which, the side furthest away from the jack goes next in an attempt to either get closer to the jack or knock the opposition’s ball out of the way. In this fashion, each end will continue until one side has played all their balls, at which point, the opposing side will play their remaining balls. The balls can be moved with hands, feet, or, if the competitor’s disability is severe, with an assistive device such as a ramp. If both teams have the same amount of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner. The number of ends and balls in each end depends on the side makeup. Individual competition consists of four ends and six balls per player per end, whilst paired competition is four ends and six balls per pair per end (three per player). Team competition is six ends, and six balls per team per end (two per player). Boccia is played on a court measuring 12.5 × 6 m with 2 m of empty space around it. The surface of the court is flat and smooth. On the court is a V-shaped line over which the jack must cross for the throw to be valid. BC1 – Players in this class throw the ball with the hand or foot. They may compete with an assistant who stays outside of the competitor’s playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested. The classification system allows riders to compete against others with a similar level of function. This is an adaptation of football for athletes with visual impairments. Teams have five players, including the goalkeeper. The ball is equipped with a noise-making device to allow players to locate it by sound. Three classes of athletes – B1 (totally or almost totally bind) and B2&B3 (partially sighted). Goalball is a team sport designed for blind athletes. Participants compete in teams of three, and try to throw a ball that has bells embedded in it into the opponents’ goal. Teams alternate throwing or rolling the ball from one end of the playing area to the other, and players remain in the area of their own goal in both defence and attack. Players must use the sound of the bell to judge the position and movement of the ball. Blindfolds allow partially sighted players to compete on an equal footing with blind players. Paralympic judo is an adaptation of the Japanese martial art of judo for visually impaired competitors. Single shells for the Arms and Shoulders category must have stabilising pontoons attached to the riggers. There are adaptations like the use of a shooting chair for competitors unable to stand, also a shooting table for events like kneeling or prone. Significant differences include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in able-bodied swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called “tappers” stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. Paralympic table tennis is asport which follows the standard rules with slight modifications for wheelchair athletes. The usual table tennis rules are in effect with the only rule difference being that the serve must cross the back of the table before it crosses the sides of the table. Some exceptions – “travelling” in wheelchair basketball occurs when the athlete touches his wheels more than twice after receiving or dribbling the ball. The individual must pass, bounce or shoot the ball before touching the wheels again. All teams use a classification system to evaluate the functional abilities of players on a point scale of 1 to 4.5. It is a mixed gender sport, and both male and female athletes play on the same teams. The goal lineis the section of the end line within the key. For a goal to count, two wheels of the player’s wheelchair must cross the line while the player has possession of the ball. This is one of the forms of tennis adapted for those who have disabilities in their lower bodies. The size of courts, balls, and rackets are same, but there are two major differences f- they use specially designed wheelchairs and the ball may bounce up to two times. The second bounce may also occur outside of the field. Quads players can hold rackets taped to the hand and use electric-powered wheelchairs. Before Europeans arrived in New Zealand, the Māori were playing a ball game called ki-o-rahi which greatly resembled Australian Rules Football and rugby football. It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population. It played by its own rules for many years. This is generally referred to as a 'yellow card' as players are generally shown one in a manner similar to association football. Suspended players are said to be sent to the sin bin and is signaled by the referee showing two outstretched hands to the offender (rugby league) or by a yellow card (rugby union). In the Northern Hemisphere it is not uncommon for referees to use both red and yellow cards in rugby league, similar to rugby union. The sport has been known in New Zealand since 1870. American football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer. Rugby, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal.\n\nQuestion: What sport or pastime would you be playing if your balls were black and blue and your opponent's were red and yellow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

One obstacle on the selected 50 km route between Liverpool and Manchester was the Sankey Valley. The company's principal engineer, George Stephenson, designed the Sankey Viaduct for the double-track railway to traverse the valley and Sankey Canal with sufficient clearance for the masts and sails of the Mersey flats that used the canal. On 15 September 1830, the viaduct was opened along with the Liverpool & Manchester railway. Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago. When the American Civil War broke out \n\n George Stephenson (9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848) was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer. Renowned as the \"Father of Railways\", Stephenson was considered by the Victorians a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement. Pioneered by Stephenson, rail transport was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century and a key component of the Industrial Revolution. Built by George and his son Robert's company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. George also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. During the age of steam locomotion, the British railway industry strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities.

The processing can include oxidation (called \"fermentation\" in the tea industry), heating, drying and the addition of herbs, flowers, spices and fruits. There are four main types of tea: black, oolong, green, and white. Tea is a natural source of caffeine, theophylline, theanine, and antioxidants; but it has almost no fat, carbohydrates, or protein Tea has been consumed in China for around 5,000 years. Both green and black tea are popular around the world, and have historically been associated with health benefits, though this is not currently supported by scientific research. **Benefits**\n\nTea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.This allows natural enzymes in the tea leaves to produce the characteristic red-brown colour and reduced astringency.Grapeseed oil also has beneficial properties and taking 30 ml daily can both increase levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol (which protects against coronary heart disease), and reduce triglyceride levels by around 15 per cent within one month. **Green tea**\n\nGreen and black tea are similar in that both are made from the young leaves and leaf buds of the same shrub, _Camellia sinensis_. sinensis sinensis_ ) and the large-leaved Assam tea plant ( _C. sinensis assamica_ ). Green tea is made by steaming and drying fresh tea leaves immediately after harvesting, while black tea is made by crushing and fermenting freshly cut tea leaves so they oxidize before drying. **Benefits**\n\nTea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.These are converted into less active antioxidants (such as theaflavins and thearubigins) during fermentation but even so, drinking four to five cups of black tea per day still provides over 50 per cent of the total dietary intake of flavonoid antioxidants (other sources include fruit and vegetables especially apples and onions). Black, white, and green tea all come from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. Green and white tea contains an abundant amount of polyphenols (which are antioxidant plant elements that have health benefits). The University of Maryland Center says that green tea can help stop the spreading of cancer cells in many forms of the disease, including breast, prostate, esophageal, and stomach. The medical center also says that green tea shows results in preventing atherosclerosis and high cholesterol, which both have the ability to change to heart disease. As for white tea it has great advantages over cancer versus green tea. Studies from Linus Pauling Institute in 2000 performed test on four types of white tea on rats to study their benefits on colon cancer protection. White tea has higher content of polyphenols than green tea. White tea has a group of antioxidants that are proven to reduce cholesterol, decrease blood pressure, repair vein tissue, and general cardiovascular function. It has been proven that white tea in animals was more resistant to Salmonella. The antioxidants of white tea help boost the immune system in both humans and animals. White tea can also thin the blood and improve artery function which in turn is good against high blood pressure. It has also been proven that adding a lemon, soy sauce, or rice milk to green tea greatly enhances the body’s absorption of its antioxidants. Hot brewed tea contains greater concentrations of polyphenols than iced tea or different bottled teas. Black tea, also translated to red tea in various Asian languages, is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name given to tea?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The name of US postal codes, \"ZIP codes\", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone plan to a zone improvement plan, \"ZIP\". Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP+4, often called \"plus-four codes\", \"add-on codes\", or \"add-ons\". For example: Mr. John Smith 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The \"16\" is the number of the postal zone in the specific city. By the early 1960s, a more organized system was needed, and non-mandatory five-digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1, 1963. The USPOD issued its Publication 59: Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1, 1963, with the list of two-letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized.

In 1983, an extended ZIP+4 code was introduced; it included the five digits of the ZIP Code, followed by a hyphen and four digits that designated a more specific location. The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly (zipping along) when senders use the code in the postal address. The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a service mark by the USPS; its registration expired in 1997.\n\nQuestion: In which decade were ZIP codes introduced in the USA?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, and lovers. Foxes and humans lived close together in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Conversely foxes were often seen as \"witch animals\", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were thought of as goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats). Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition in Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: \"Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes \n\nThe zenko (善狐) are benevolent, celestial foxes associated with Inari; they are sometimes simply called Inari foxes in English. There are two common classifications of kitsune:  Local traditions add further types. For example, a ninko is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses them. The following is a list of appearances made by kitsune (Japanese foxes) in various works of popular fiction. Embedded in popular folklore as they are, kitsune have made appearances in many contemporary Japanese works. There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hito-gitsune are also called kitsunetsuki.\n\nQuestion: What are the shape-shifting foxes of the Japanese folklore?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
