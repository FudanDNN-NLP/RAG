Pérez was a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy until 2012. He took his first Formula One podium at the 2012 Malaysian Grand Prix with Sauber. Pérez joined McLaren for the 2013 season, but the team did not score a single podium finish. Subsequently, for the 2014 season, the team decided \n\n  The most notable Mexican professional auto racers have been Pedro Rodríguez, who was the winner of the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans, and his brother Ricardo Rodríguez, who at age 18 finished second at the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans, becoming the youngest ever to stand on the podium. The Mexico City racetrack Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (\"Rodríguez Brothers Racetrack\") was named in their honor. Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez has hosted several racing events including the Formula 1 (1962–1970, 1986–1992, 2015–present), \n\n Pérez drove for the Campos Grand Prix team in the 2008–09 GP2 Asia Series, partnering Russian driver Vitaly Petrov. He was the first Mexican driver to compete at this level of motorsport since Giovanni Aloi took part in International Formula 3000 in 1990. He moved to Arden International for the main 2009 GP2 Series, driving alongside fellow Formula Three graduate Edoardo Mortara. Adrián Fernández has become a popular driver in Mexico since the 1990s and reached his climax when he finished in second place during the 2000 CART season. Memo Rojas and Luis Díaz have also been successful in formula racing and sports car racing. Daniel Suárez won the 2016 \n\n The 1990 Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on 24 June 1990. It was sixth race of the 1990 Formula One World Championship, the 14th Mexican Grand Prix and the fifth since the Mexico City circuit returned to the Formula One calendar in 1986. Prost, the 1988 race winner, became the second multiple-winner in Mexican Grand Prix history, joining British driver Jim Clark who won the race in 1962 (non-championship), 1963 and 1967.\n\nQuestion: Which other Mexican Formula One race car driver has held the podium besides the Force India driver born in 1990?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Several species of North American plants in the genus Proboscidea and certain species of Pisonia, however, are also known by this name. Etymology\nThe genera name is derived from the Greek words harpago meaning hook and phyton meaning plant. Ecology and management \nHarpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year). The stems grow from a persistent primary tuber and several secondary tubers (the harvested organs) grow from the primary tuber at the end of fleshy roots. The plant gets its scientific and common names from the hooked spines of its woody capsules (see photo). The mature fruit opens slowly so that, in a given year, only 20-25% of its seeds may establish soil contact. They have a low respiration rate and may remain viable in the seed bank for more than 20 years. At various times, the species has been proposed for protection by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Stewart and Cole (2005) examined the complex economic, social, and cultural factors involved in the harvest of the species. Harvest also did not affect growth, although plants in the medium size class grew more during the study period in both the harvested and unharvested populations. Fruit production was highly variable, and mature fruits were produced only under favorable conditions.

The two others were the Swan Island Shipyard, located several miles upriver on Swan Island; and the Vancouver Shipyard, located across the Columbia River from Portland in Vancouver, Washington. The rapid expansion of Portland area shipyards during World War II and contraction afterward caused similar expansion and contraction of the population of Vanport City, Oregon, which was also built by Henry J.

Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Kerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and fled to Pskov, where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to re-take the city. Kerensky narrowly escaped, and he spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country, eventually arriving in France. During the Russian Civil War, he supported neither side, as he opposed both the Bolshevik regime and the White Movement. Under Allied pressure to continue the war, he launched what became known as the Kerensky Offensive against the Austro-Hungarian/German South Army on 1 July 1917. At first successful, the offensive soon met strong resistance and the Central Powers riposted with a strong counter-attack. The military heavily criticised Kerensky \n\n After the February Revolution, the former Tsar and his family were taken captive and held as prisoners during the Russian Civil War. Alexander Kerensky, leader of the provisional government moved them to the former Governor's mansion in Tobolsk.

It was first published in Italian in 2014 (before the author's best-seller Seven Brief Lessons on Physics). The book is collection of 1929 university lectures by Heisenberg but with more detailed mathematics. In the book, after briefly discussing various theories, including quantum theory, Heisenberg discusses the basis for the fundamental concepts of quantum theory. The culmination of his teaching is his highly regarded and widely praised \"trilogy\" of graduate level textbooks: Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell, Einstein Gravity in a Nutshell, and Group Theory in a Nutshell for Physicists. He is also the author of several books for general readers about physics and Chinese culture. He tells the history and principles of modern physics. He seeks to \"combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\" The book examines the history of scientific knowledge about the universe. It later presents the work of Nicolaus Copernicus, who advocated the concept that the Earth is not located in the center of the universe. The central claim of the book is that the theory of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity together help us understand how universes could have formed out of nothing.

Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops from Italian Eritrea having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Mekele, forcing its surrender. Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italian soldiers and Eritrean askaris a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. The war concluded with the Treaty of Addis Ababa.

Zeffirelli, however, requested to be allowed to film the productions as if they were movies instead. In part, because both operas starred popular tenor Plácido Domingo, Unitel agreed to help finance the project. Zeffirelli insisted that Canadian soprano Teresa Stratas play Nedda, even though she was not originally cast in the stage production. He had a wooden platform built over the front seats of the auditorium, where he placed his cameras to film the action onstage. He later did pick-up shots at an Italian film studio. Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of Cannon Films worked out a deal with popular operatic tenor Plácido Domingo to finance him in a film version of an opera. Domingo, however, suggested instead that they film Otello, his signature role. While working with Italian director Franco Zeffirelli on a stage production of Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera, Domingo discussed the possibility of collaborating again on another opera movie. They had previously made television versions of Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci together, as well as a theatrically released movie of Verdi's La Traviata. Zeffirelli agreed to direct Domingo in Otello. Zeffirelli later recalled that the tenor used his hard work on Otello to help forget the traumatic sights in Mexico of the injured and dead (which included some of his family members). Thereafter Domingo frequently returned to Salzburg for a number of operas, as well as for several concert performances. Domingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca in a 1961 performance in Mexico City. He sang Cavaradossi at the Met on February 15, 1969 with Birgit Nilsson (broadcast). 1971 he made his Covent Garden debut \n\n In June 1980, MGM announced they had signed a deal with Pavarotti to star in the movie.

The Green Pastures is a play written in 1930 by Marc Connelly adapted from Ol' Man Adam an' His Chillun (1928), a collection of stories written by Roark Bradford. The play was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930. The play and the film adaptation were generally well received and hailed by white drama and film critics.

The play is about corporate soldiers and Brace wrote it after a tour of Jordan where he conducted interviews with men in that job. The play was critically acclaimed, receiving numerous five star reviews and being called \"rivetingly intelligent\" by the Sunday Times and \"exhilaratingly convincing ' by The Independent. The play was named at number 10 in The Times Top Twenty Plays of the Decade.

Thus, it can be used to analyze and compare profitability among companies and industries, as it eliminates the effects of financing and capital expenditures. It is also a useful metric for understanding a business’s ability to generate cash flow for its owners and for judging a company’s operating performance. The difference between EBITDA and OCF would then reflect how the entity finances its net working capital in the short term. Mylan NV NASDAQ/NGS:MYLView full report here!

What this means is that while there are still plenty of duds out there, there are also a few undervalued stocks to buy; it has just become a little trickier to find them amid all the flashy comeback stories.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo find the best stocks to invest in now,disciplined investors might start with their own watch list, which should contain \"wish list\" stocks that are usually too expensive or have been put there to be on the backburner for later. Among such stocks, companies that got left out of the rally are the most compelling. Such companies may work to resolve the business problem at hand, which improves its prospects and leads to a higher share price in the long run. As long as the bad news reported is a temporary setback and the business model is not broken, the risks behind buying a stock on a dip are lower. Net earnings rose $46.5 million to $60.1 million, bringing in earnings of 44 cents a share.

Corporations can alternatively sell shares of the company to investors to raise capital. Investors, or shareholders, expect that there will be an upward trend in value of the company (or appreciate in value) over time to make their investment a profitable purchase. Shareholder value is increased when corporations invest equity capital and other funds into projects (or investments) that earn a positive rate of return for the owners. Investors prefer to buy shares of stock in companies that will consistently earn a positive rate of return on capital in the future, thus increasing the market value of the stock of that corporation. Shareholder value may also be increased when corporations payout excess cash surplus (funds from retained earnings that are not needed for business) in the form of dividends.\n\nQuestion: What type of activity does Owner earnings and Warren Buffett have in common?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Nevertheless, Blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language. Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at Brunner and Mond, an advanced chemical plant in Billingham in County Durham, northeast England.

Krotite was reported in 2011 in a calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion (CAI) in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorite NWA (North West Africa) 1934, which landed in Morocco. The mineral name was approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA 2010-038) and honors Alexander N. Krot, a researcher in cosmochemistry at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, Hawaii. Researchers have found that the mineral, which has the same atomic arrangement as a man-made component of some types of concrete, forms under low pressure at a temperature of at least 1500 C. These conditions of high temperature and low pressure are consistent with a hypothesis that the \n\n Artinite (IMA symbol: Art ) is a hydrated magnesium carbonate mineral with formula: Mg2(CO3)(OH)2·3H2O. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and a specific gravity of 2. It occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal veins and in serpentinized ultramafic rocks. Associated minerals include brucite, hydromagnesite, pyroaurite, chrysotile, aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite. Hydroxyapatite, also called hydroxylapatite (HA), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca5(PO4)3(OH), but it is usually written Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH− ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of dental fluorosis. Up to 50% by volume and 70% by weight of human bone is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, known as bone mineral. Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are composed. Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the pineal gland and other structures, known as corpora arenacea or \"brain sand\". The hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below:\n\n10 Ca(OH)2 + 6 H3PO4 → Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 18 H2O\n\nThe ability to synthetically replicate hydroxyapatite has invaluable clinical implications, especially in dentistry. Stoichiometric apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO42−, anions. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness. A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by amelogenins and enamelins instead of collagen. Hydroxyapatite is the main mineral component of enamel in teeth. Avian eggshell hydroxyapatite  can be a viable filler material in bone regeneration procedures in oral surgery. Hydroxyapatite has shown significant medium and long-term desensitizing effects on dentine hypersensitivity using evaporative stimuli and the visual analogue scale (alongside potassium nitrate, arginine, glutaraldehyde with hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyapatite, adhesive systems, glass ionomer cements and laser). To prevent this, nano-hydroxyapatite can be added to the bleaching solution to reduce the impact of the bleaching agent by blocking pores within the enamel. Caries prevention \nNano-hydroxyapatite possesses a remineralising effect on teeth and can be used to prevent damage from carious attacks. It is chemically similar to naturally occurring hydroxyapatite and can mimic the structure and biological function of the structures found in the resident extracellular matrix. As a dental material \nHydroxyapatite is widely used within dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery, due to its chemical similarity to hard tissue. In recent years, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (nHA) have been used in toothpaste to combat dental hypersensitivity. It involves ionic interactions between positively charged groups on a biomolecule (often a protein) and the phosphate groups in hydroxyapatite, and metal chelation between hydroxyapatite calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate and/or carboxyl groups on the biomolecule. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of trace elements, including carbon, oxygen and strontium. Defluoridation\nHydroxyapatite is a potential adsorbent for the defluoridation of drinking water, as it forms fluorapatite in a three step process. However, during the defluoridation process the hydroxyapatite dissolves, and increases the pH and phosphate ion concentration which makes the defluoridated water unfit for drinking.

It is believed that around 100 British soldiers were executed in captivity by the Mysorean forces. However, Holkar had to leave Bharatpur as the Jat King Ranjit Singh of Bharatpur defeated the British army on 17 April 1805. Covering a large part of the subcontinent, the Maratha Empire kept the British forces at bay during the 18th century, until dissension between the Peshwas and their sardars (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the empire with the eventual defeat in the third Anglo-Maratha war the First Anglo-Maratha War ended in a stalemate with both sides signing the treaty of Salbai. The Siege of Ahmednagar was the first battle of the Second Anglo-Maratha War fought between the Maratha Confederacy and the British East India Company. When he determined that a long defensive war would ruin his army, Wellesley decided to act boldly to defeat the numerically larger force of the Maratha Empire. With the logistic assembly of his army complete (24,000 men in total) he gave the order to break camp and attack the nearest Maratha fort on 8 August 1803. With the fort now in British control Wellesley was able to extend control southwards to the river Godavari. A force of the British East India Company led by Major General Fraser defeated a Maratha force under Yashwantrao Holkar and a force of Hindu Jats led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\n\nQuestion: During Siege of Bharatpur, which Commander-in-Chief of Ireland and Commander-in-Chief of India contributed to the storming of the castle?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The look and style of the films heavily influences more modern holiday classics such as Elf (2003). Beginning in 2013, and for several years thereafter, the animation studio ShadowMachine was hired by the SoCal Honda Dealers group (via Secret Weapon Marketing) to create stop-motion animated commercials in the style of Rankin/Bass's Christmas specials. In 1964, he was hired as music director for the television production company Videocraft International (now known as Rankin/Bass), a post which he held for roughly 20 years. In this capacity, he conducted and scored music for a number of animated features, including The Hobbit, Jack Frost, The Flight of Dragons, The Daydreamer, The Wacky World of Mother Goose, Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and Frosty the Snowman. His most widely known work may be an adaptation of Johnny Marks' score for the well-known Christmas special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, first aired in 1964.

Educated at New York University, he first worked at an advertising agency in New York until the early 1960s, when he founded the film production company Videocraft International (now called Rankin/Bass) with his partner Arthur Rankin Jr. He is known for his collaborations with Arthur Rankin Jr., co-directing and producing a wide array of stop motion animated features and cartoons, notably the hit cartoon ThunderCats (1985–1989). He composed the score for some of these films, collaborating with Maury Laws. Bass also wrote for some of the company's specials under the pseudonym \"Julian P.

Blandy, another mayor of Reading. Following continuing increases in the responsibilities of the county council, county leaders chose to procure a new purpose-built Shire Hall for council officers and their departments: the site selected on the southern side of Forbury Gardens had been occupied by buildings associated with the Royal Berkshire Seed Establishment. The new building, which was designed by Septimus Warwick and H Austen Hall in the Queen Anne style, was built by E. C. Hughes of Wokingham and opened as the Shire Hall in 1911. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with five bays facing onto The Forbury; the ground floor, which was faced in Portland stone, featured a three-bay portico in antis with Doric order columns while the first and second floors featured casement windows \n\n subscription.

The Queen, Elizabeth II, chose the location for the statue and the matter was considered by the government in 1982. The statue was put in place in October 1983 and the area remained under heavy guard until the formal ceremony on 2 November. In 1985, for the memorial's 50th anniversary, local resident Sylvia Ayling organised a street march and re-enactment of the unveiling, this time by peace activist Maggie Freake.

[...] That song contained what I wasn't hearing a lot of on the CMA Awards show: substance. Country Universe stated that Miranda Lambert's performance (along with Carrie Underwood's \"Just a Dream\") was the best performance of the night. \"With understated brilliance, Lambert shifted gears by offering her Texas twang on the stripped-down ballad.\" The title song tells the story of a small town girl whose aspirations take her to New Orleans, where she becomes a prostitute, dreaming of the boy she'd left behind. \"Daddy\", a Parton composition, tells the story of a daughter pleading with her father to reconsider leaving her mother for a woman much younger. Also included are Parton's covers of the Mac Davis-penned Elvis Presley hit \"In the Ghetto\" and Joe South's \"Games People Play\". She also covered current country hits by Porter Wagoner (\"Big Wind\") and Jan Howard (\"We Had All the Good Things Going\"). In a CMT interview with Patty Loveless, Parton confirmed that the man on the album cover is her reclusive husband, Carl Dean. Parton re-recorded the title song for her 1982 album Heartbreak Express. Lyrically, it acknowledges that any relationship has occasional annoyances, but these aren't enough to prompt Mraz to give up on it. The song's female narrator describes going through her daily routine and being constantly reminded of her former love interest (\"I turned on the radio / Stupid song made me think of you\"). However, she copes with the pain (\"I listened to it for a minute / But then I changed it\"), assuring herself that each time she pushes his memory away, she gets \"a little bit stronger.\" The song was written by Luke Laird, Hillary Lindsey, Hillary Scott of Lady Antebellum, the latter of whom also performed harmony vocals on the record. The lyrics were inspired by a real-life experience from Scott, who had just dealt with a break up with a loved one.\n\nQuestion: Which song was behind the third single on the album  \"A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)\" for two weeks on the country charts?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

After being drafted by the San Francisco Giants, he was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 1968 MLB expansion draft. His most productive season came in with Baltimore, when he recorded seven wins against five losses with a 1.95 ERA, nine saves, and had career-numbers in strikeouts (77) and innings pitched (111.0). Lonnie Warneke (March 28, 1909 – June 23, 1976) (pronounced WARN-a-key), nicknamed \"The Arkansas Hummingbird\", was a Major League Baseball player, Major League umpire, county judge, and businessman from Montgomery County, Arkansas, whose career won-loss record as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs (1930–36, 1942–43, 1945) and St. Louis Cardinals (1937–42) was 192–121. Warneke pitched for the National League in the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933, hitting the first triple and scoring the first National League run in All-Star game history. Hammonds was an outfielder and played for the Baltimore Orioles (1993–1998), Cincinnati Reds (1998–1999), Colorado Rockies (2000), Milwaukee Brewers (2001–2003), San Francisco Giants (2003–2004) and the Washington Nationals (2005) in Major League Baseball (MLB). Before playing professionally, Hammonds played for Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey and Stanford University. The Orioles selected Hammonds with the fourth overall selection of the 1992 MLB Draft. Though he was seen as one of the best prospects in baseball, injuries limited his performance with Baltimore. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he emerged with the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. On September 12, 1964, while starting for the Athletics on the road at Memorial Stadium, he and Baltimore Orioles left-hander Frank Bertaina each pitched a complete game one-hitter, but the A's lost 1-0 as Jackie Brandt hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 8th to score pinch-runner Bob Saverine from third. John Craig \"Sonny\" Dixon (November 5, 1924 – November 19, 2011) was an American professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for four seasons with the Washington Senators (1953–1954), Philadelphia / Kansas City Athletics (1954–1955) and New York Yankees (1956). Signed by the Senators prior to the 1941 season, Dixon served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II and missed three years (1943–1945) of his baseball career.

Smeaton's Eddystone lighthouse used 24 candles until 1810. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. It provided a brighter and more efficient light compared to previous oil lamps. Aimé Argand's invention greatly contributed to the improvement of illumination during the late 18th century. The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant. In the 1850s the light was provided from a burning wick in a whale oil lamp. They typically used an Argand lamp which featured a hollow wick in a glass chimney for better, brighter, combustion with a silvered parabolic reflector behind the lamp to direct and intensify the light output. All oil fired lamps used burning wicks to make the light—giving rise to one of the lighthouse keeper's nickname as \"wickies\" as they spent a great deal of their time trimming the wicks on \n\n wick before being drawn into cylindrical chimney. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, in partnership with Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.\n\nQuestion: The lamp used in many lighthouses is similiar to this type of lamp patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was written and composed by Stephen Schwartz. A pop single version of \"When You Believe\", with additional music and lyrics by writer-producer Kenneth Edmonds, was also recorded for the film by American singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston for the film's end credits and its soundtrack album. Additionally, the song serves as the lead single for both Houston's fourth studio album, My Love Is Your Love and Carey's first compilation album, #1's.

At the dance, Mickey and Minnie play \"Turkey in the Straw\" on piano and violin for an appreciative crowd of farm animals. Mickey imaginatively uses a pail, a washtub and even Minnie's tail to play the song, but she doesn't appreciate his creativity and slaps his hand away. Mickey dances with Clarabelle, a dachsund, and a large pig. Two gates open and guests see Elsa, who is singing \"Let It Go\" while conjuring ice.

The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products. The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland. Organizational structure\n\n Department of Health and Human Services\n Food and Drug Administration\n Office of the Commissioner\n Office of Operations\n Office of Equal Employment Opportunity\n Office of Human Resources\n Office of Finance, Budget and Acquisition\n Office of Information Management and Technology\n Office of Informatics & Technology Innovation\n \n Office of Information Management\n Office of Security Operations\n Office of Facilities Engineering and Mission Support Services\n Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)\n Center for Tobacco Products (CTP)\n Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE)\n Office of Regulatory Affairs\n Office of Clinical Policy and Programs\n Office of External Affairs\n Office of Food Policy and Response\n Office of Minority Health and Health Equity\n Office of Policy, Legislation, and International Affairs\n Office of the Chief Scientist\n Office of Women's Health\n National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR)\n\nLocation\n\nHeadquarters \nFDA headquarters facilities are currently located in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, Maryland. White Oak Federal Research Center \nSince 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on  of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately  of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately  of office and special use space to their existing facilities. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. Other locations \nThe FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Scope and funding\nAs of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. Regulatory programs\n\nEmergency  approvals (EUA)\n\nEmergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. \"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"\nThe FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry. There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\". Medical countermeasures (MCMs)\n\nMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. The FDA runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. Medications\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. A drug is considered \"new\" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different excipients or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. New medications\n\nNew drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a new drug application (NDA). Under the Trump administration, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster. New drugs are available only by prescription by default. A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. (See FDA Special Protocol Assessment about Phase III trials.) Post-market safety surveillance\nAfter NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis. The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program. While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely. For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing \n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices. On March 18, 2020, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died. Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology\n\nThe Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents. These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs. The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 Biologics Control Act, with additional authority established by the 1944 Public Health Service Act. Along with these Acts, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the National Institutes of Health; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972. Medical and radiation-emitting devices\n\nThe Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complex devices such as implantable neurostimulators. \"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"\nClearance requests are required for medical devices that prove they are \"substantially equivalent\" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate \"safety and efficacy\", for example they may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Veterinary products\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals. The FDA's requirements to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers. CVM does not regulate vaccines for animals; these are handled by the United States Department of Agriculture. Tobacco products\nThe FDA regulates tobacco products with authority established by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Surgeon General. In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device. A more recent example of the FDA's international work is their 2018 cooperation with regulatory and law-enforcement agencies worldwide through Interpol as part of Operation Pangea XI. The FDA targeted 465 websites that illegally sold potentially dangerous, unapproved versions of opioid, oncology, and antiviral prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. Science and research programs\n\nThe FDA carries out research and development activities to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments. The FDA's research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women's health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine. Data management\nThe FDA has collected a large amount of data through the decades. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse named Jim who had contracted tetanus. The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry. In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective. When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove oxymorphone hydrochloride from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history. 21st century reforms\n\nCritical Path Initiative\nThe Critical Path Initiative is the FDA's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products. A 2006 court case, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. Pediatric drug testing\nPrior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective. An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate. President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 which extended the authorization until 2017. Rules for generic biologics\nSince the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher's Disease patients for life. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. Characterized as \"corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk,\" these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report on the agency as well. The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.

FDA also advances the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and affordable; and by helping the public get the accurate, science based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health. 2/ The FY 2015 and FY 2016 appropriations directed FDA to transfer a total of $1.5 million to the HHS Office of Inspector General for oversight activities. 3/ The Drug Quality and Security Act (P.L. 113-54) authorized three new FDA user fees: the outsourcing facility fees; the prescription drug wholesale distributer licensing and inspection; and, the third-party logistics provider licensing and inspection fees. FDA expects that collections for wholesale distributer and third-party logics provider fees in FY 2015, FY 2016, and FY 2017 will be minimal. 4/ The FY 2017 President’s Budget proposes to increase the statutory user fee limit for export certification. The FY 2017 Budget includes $5.1 billion in total resources for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an increase of $358 million, or 8 percent above FY 2016. Of this increase, $15 million is in budget authority, $269 million in user fees, and $75 million in new mandatory funding. FDA estimates that Americans pay about two cents per day to ensure that the products FDA regulates, representing more than 20 percent of every consumer dollar spent on products in the United States are safe and effective. The Budget will continue to invest in transforming the food safety system to address today’s challenges, ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical products, supporting the Department’s preparedness enterprise, reducing tobacco use, and conducting innovative research. FDA oversees the safety of approximately 80 percent of the food supply, including a growing proportion of imported products. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was enacted in 2011 and provided FDA with the authorities to transform the food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness and other food hazards to preventing them. In 2015, FDA issued five foundational final rules that established the framework for a secure food supply, including preventive controls for food and feed, and will continue in 2016 with finalizing two more. In FY 2017, FDA will build on these regulations and guide the modernization of our food safety system by prioritizing prevention, supporting risk-based oversight, and expanding collaboration in the food safety community. The Budget includes $1.5 billion for food safety across FDA programs, an increase of $212 million above FY 2016, an increase of $18 million in budget authority and $193 million in user fees. This total includes $1.3 billion in budget authority and $210 million in user fees. In FY 2017, FDA will focus on implementing produce standards for packing, harvesting, and growing fruits and vegetables; and ensuring imported foods meet the same standards of safety as those in the United States. The additional $193 million in new resources are vital to fully support robust implementation of a prevention based food safety system. The FDA Budget continues to propose the food contact substance notification user fee to reduce microbial food contamination through premarket notification, as well as including currently authorized fees that will support food safety across FDA to expedite processes such as the timely assessment of color additives used in foods, drugs, and cosmetics, and approval of certifications to facilitate international trade. These programs include: the voluntary qualified importer program, export certification, third party auditor program, and the food reinspection and recall fees. In FY 2017, the FDA food safety portfolio will continue to support other vital food and feed safety activities that are important to the public such as improving the availability of nutritional information to assist with decisions made by individuals and their families, ensuring that food additives and coloring meet standards set by FDA, and guarding public health by ensuring information on food labels is based on the most current science. For example, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is proposing to update the Nutrition Facts Label to better reflect new scientific information and changed consumer preferences. FDA continues to make significant progress in reducing the number of drug shortages, from a high of 251 shortages in 2011 to just 44 new shortages in 2014. As the global market grows and complex challenges arise, FDA is working to keep pace with the latest science and leverage state, local, and foreign partnerships to protect the public health. Initiatives across FDA programs continue to address new and emerging technologies in regulatory science including 3-D printing, genome sequencing, and computer simulations. FDA ensures the safety, quality and effectiveness of a broad scope of medical products used by Americans including biologics such as vaccines, blood products, and gene therapies, prescription and over-the-counter drugs, radiation emitting products, and medical devices ranging from dental devices to surgical implants. This significant accomplishment represents the next step to increasing treatment options for patients. These activities will continue in FY 2017 to improve patient safety by establishing systems that will allow standardized approaches to quickly and efficiently identify drug and device products in the market and streamline the way biologics are reviewed. In addition, in 2015, FDA successfully launched a mobile application to improve public access to information, including current drug shortages, and resolve drug shortages and discontinuations of drug products. In FY 2017, FDA will continue to invest in developing a safer and more modern drug supply system by building on the infrastructure to process biological product applications and support integration of the Unique Facility Identifier into IT systems that support regulatory work. FDA supports the program’s goal to enhance access to high‑quality, lower cost generic drugs. Medical product safety investments in the FY 2017 Budget total $2.8 billion at the program level, $116 million above FY 2016. The Budget will advance FDA’s highest priority activities to ensure that human and animal drugs, biologics, and medical devices available to the American public meet current requirements and standards for safety. In FY 2017, FDA activities include but are not limited to domestic and foreign drug establishment inspections, pre-and post-market product surveillance, research on biologics, human drugs, and devices to help inform FDA program’s and the medical product community, and review of new medical products that will be available to the public. The Budget includes a total of approximately $18 million in budget authority, an increase of $1 million above FY 2016, to continue and extend FDA’s oversight of drugs produced by compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities. Increased efforts in these areas will help to prevent outbreaks that could result in deaths or injuries to patients who receive compounded drugs. Oversight of compounding facilities is critical to protecting patients. In FY 2015, FDA conducted 116 inspections of compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities across the nation. Funding requested in the Budget will build on FY 2016 activities, including inspection and enforcement, developing policies that will ensure compliance with the Drug Quality and Security Act, and facilitating state collaboration and coordination. The Budget includes $42 million in support of the Administration’s National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, the same as FY 2016, which will advance efforts to support the judicious use of medically‑important antimicrobials in food‑producing animals, to evaluate new antibacterial drugs for patient treatments, to streamline clinical trials, and to develop better vaccines for antibiotic resistant organisms. Fighting antibiotic resistance is both a public health and national security priority, and FDA has made strides to make sure effective antibiotics are available in the future. The Budget will build on FDA’s current work in this area, which includes implementing the Veterinary Feed Directive, which would make illegal the use of medically important antibiotics for animal production purposes and bring remaining uses for legitimate animal health purposes under veterinary supervision. In January 2015, the Precision Medicine Initiative was launched to empower health care providers to tailor treatment and prevention strategies to individuals’ unique characteristics and genetic makeup. To that end, FDA developed precisionFDA, an online, cloud-based, portal that will allow scientists from industry, academia, government and other partners to come together to foster innovation and develop the science behind a method of reading DNA known as next‑generation sequencing. FDA is also a key participant in the President’s Precision Medicine Initiative. In the last year, FDA has approved several new Precision Medicine-based therapies and launched precisionFDA, a platform for academic and commercial collaboration. The Budget includes $4 million, an increase of $2 million above FY 2016, to support these activities including supporting precisionFDA and working with the scientific community to develop new reference datasets for validating genetic tests. FDA’s advancement of precision medicine will help reduce the burden of disease by targeting prevention and treatment more effectively. These efforts directly support precision medicine activities across HHS. The Budget also provides $75 million in mandatory resources over five years in order to accelerate progress in cancer as part of the Vice President’s Cancer “Moonshot” initiative. FDA will closely interface with the NIH National Cancer Institute to streamline the development and expedite the approval of novel devices, drugs, biologics, and combination products. FDA will also support improved access to new treatments through cancer clinical trials and access programs, and will enhance sharing of cancer data from clinical trials to promote biological and clinical breakthroughs. FDA infrastructure and facilities, including 56 laboratories strategically located across the continental United States and Puerto Rico, directly support mission critical work and enable FDA to respond to food safety and medical product safety activities. These responsibilities have increased as a result of groundbreaking legislation Congress has passed over recent years, and as a result, FDA has experienced a significant increase in its workforce to carry out these activities. The FY 2017 Budget ensures that FDA facilities are optimally functioning to carry out its growing responsibilities for food and medical product safety. The Budget invests a total of $423 million, $4 million above FY 2016, in FDA infrastructure including costs to keep up with the science and continue planned activities in the White Oak Complex. In 2016, FDA will complete a feasibility study at the White Oak Campus to address its expanded workforce as well as the continued consolidation and construction required to accommodate them. These resources will also ensure FDA’s leased offices and labs across the country are functional and support the workforce in meeting its public health mission. In addition, the Budget provides $12 million, an increase of $3 million above FY 2016, to fund repair and maintenance of FDA-owned facilities. This investment will begin to address high priority needs across owned facilities to ensure FDA can achieve its regulatory responsibilities, strategic priorities, and program initiatives. These investments directly support FDA’s ability to carry out its responsibilities in facilities that can meet modern challenges. FDA supports the establishment and sustainment of an adequate supply of medical countermeasures to protect against chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and emerging infectious disease threats. FDA approved the majority of medical countermeasure marketing applications under review in FY 2015 that met standards for safety, efficacy, and quality. The FY 2017 Budget includes $25 million to continue the Medical Countermeasures Initiative program which directly supports FDA’s countermeasures efforts across the agency and the Department’s preparedness activities. This legislation has enabled FDA to make significant progress towards making tobacco-related death and disease a part of the nation’s past and not its future. FDA, through the Center for Tobacco Products, executes its regulatory and public health responsibilities in program areas that support the following objectives: preventing initiation, particularly among youth; decreasing the harms of tobacco product use; and encouraging cessation. The Center for Tobacco Products continues to build on accomplishments to prevent tobacco use in youth; educate Americans on the harms of tobacco products; ensure compliance with the Tobacco Control Act; review new tobacco products and changes to existing products to reduce harm; and, support cutting edge research. In May 2015, FDA launched the first phase of its “Fresh Empire” campaign, which is designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use among at-risk multi‑racial youth aged 12 to 17 who may become regular smokers. In 2017, FDA will continue to build on these campaigns to reach out to youth. The FY 2017 Budget includes $596 million in user fees to support the FDA tobacco program and contributes to the Department’s crosscutting efforts to reduce tobacco use in the United States. FDA will focus resources on five strategic priorities: 1) product standards to protect public health; 2) an FDA‑wide nicotine regulatory policy; 3) premarket and post market product controls: regulations and product reviews; 4) compliance and enforcement through inspections, investigations, monitoring, and review of covered tobacco products; and 5) public education efforts particularly among youth. The Budget assumes resources from five new user fee programs, an increase to one currently authorized fee program, and scheduled increases in all currently authorized user fee programs. Resources from user fees are critical to enable FDA to carry out its mission and institute performance metrics that lead to greater efficiencies and increased speed at which products are available to the public. First, the Budget continues to propose the international courier user fee, which would provide $6 million to support activities associated with increased surveillance related to the increased volume of FDA‑regulated commodities, predominantly medical products, imported through express courier hubs. This request also includes the proposed cosmetic user fee totaling $20 million to support FDA’s role in ensuring the safety of cosmetic products in the United States as the volume of both domestic and imported cosmetic products continues to grow and manufacturing technology and ingredients become more complex. Finally, the Budget proposes to increase the allowable fee amount for the export certification fee to keep up with the growing costs of these certification activities. The agency is responsible for overseeing and regulating a wide range of products, including food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, pharmaceutical drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and more. The primary objective of the FDA is to protect and promote public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. For example, the FDA enforces the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), which sets the standards and regulations for food, drugs, and cosmetics marketed in the United States. In addition to the FD&C Act, the FDA also enforces other laws and regulations, such as Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. This wide-ranging authority allows the FDA to address public health concerns beyond food and drugs. They regulate and control items like medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices, animal foods and feed, and veterinary products. They are dedicated to upholding public health standards and promoting the safety of the American population. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) procures funding and manages alliances with public and private institutions in support of the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the premier medical research agency. The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s food supply, cosmetics and products that emit radiation, and by regulating the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is the nation’s medical research agency—making important medical discoveries that improve health and save lives. Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, Americans today are living longer and healthier. In recent years, nationwide rates of new diagnoses and deaths from all cancers combined have fallen significantly. PhRMA members alone invested an estimated $45.8 billion in 2009 in discovering and developing new medicines. Industry-wide research and investment reached a record $65.3 billion in 2009. CMS is charged with setting payment policies and promoting innovation that will increase health care quality, lower costs and improve the health of all Americans, ensuring that more than 100 million Americans have access to the hospital and doctors’ services, prescription medication, nursing home care and other essential services they need. BIO is the world’s largest biotechnology organization, providing advocacy, business development and communications services for more than 1,100 members worldwide. We also represent state and regional biotech associations, service providers to the industry and academic centers. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products. The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. The FDA has its headquarters in unincorporated White Oak, Maryland.

White Oak Federal Research Center \nSince 1990, the FDA has had employees and facilities on  of the White Oak Federal Research Center in the White Oak area of Silver Spring, Maryland. In 2001, the General Services Administration (GSA) began new construction on the campus to consolidate the FDA's 25 existing operations in the Washington metropolitan area, its headquarters in Rockville, and several fragmented office buildings. The first building, the Life Sciences Laboratory, was dedicated and opened with 104 employees in December 2003. As of December 2018, the FDA campus has a population of 10,987 employees housed in approximately  of space, divided into ten office and four laboratory buildings. The campus houses the Office of the Commissioner (OC), the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA),  the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and offices for the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). With the passing of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA is projecting a 64% increase in employees to 18,000 over the next 15 years, and would like to add approximately  of office and special use space to their existing facilities. Each district comprises a main district office and a number of Resident Posts, which are FDA remote offices that serve a particular geographic area. Other locations \nThe FDA has a number of field offices across the United States, in addition to international locations in China, India, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Scope and funding\nAs of 2021, the FDA had responsibility for overseeing $2.7 trillion in food, medical, and tobacco products. Some 54% of its budget derives from the federal government, and 46% is covered by industry user fees for FDA services. Regulatory programs\n\nEmergency  approvals (EUA)\n\nEmergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism that was created to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines and personal protective equipment, during public health emergencies such as the Zika virus epidemic, the Ebola virus epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the FDA regulates almost every facet of prescription drugs, including testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, efficacy, and safety—yet FDA regulation of cosmetics focuses primarily on labeling and safety. The FDA regulates most products with a set of published standards enforced by a modest number of facility inspections. For example, in 2018, the agency published an online \"black list,\" in which it named dozens of branded drug companies that are supposedly using unlawful or unethical means to attempt to impede competition from generic drug companies. They also often work with local and state government agencies in performing regulatory inspections and enforcement actions. Furthermore, legislation had granted the FDA a variety of means to address violations of standards for a given substance category. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the FDA is responsible for ensuring that manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients meet the current requirements. \"FDA-Approved\" vs. \"FDA-Accepted in Food Processing\"\nThe FDA does not approve applied coatings used in the food processing industry. There is no review process to approve the composition of nonstick coatings; nor does the FDA inspect or test these materials. Through their governing of processes, however, the FDA does have a set of regulations that cover the formulation, manufacturing, and use of nonstick coatings. Hence, materials like Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) are not, and cannot be, considered as FDA Approved, rather, they are \"FDA Compliant\" or \"FDA Acceptable\". Medical countermeasures (MCMs)\n\nMedical countermeasures (MCMs) are products such as biologics and pharmaceutical drugs that can protect from or treat the health effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attack. The FDA runs a program called the \"FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative\" (MCMi), with programs funded by the federal government. Medications\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research uses different requirements for the three main drug product types: new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs. A drug is considered \"new\" if it is made by a different manufacturer, uses different excipients or inactive ingredients, is used for a different purpose, or undergoes any substantial change. New medications\n\nNew drugs receive extensive scrutiny before FDA approval in a process called a new drug application (NDA). Under the Trump administration, the agency has worked to make the drug-approval process go faster. New drugs are available only by prescription by default. A change to over-the-counter (OTC) status is a separate process, and the drug must be approved through an NDA first. Very rare limited exceptions to this multi-step process involving animal testing and controlled clinical trials can be granted out of compassionate use protocols. (See FDA Special Protocol Assessment about Phase III trials.) Post-market safety surveillance\nAfter NDA approval, the sponsor must then review and report to the FDA every single patient adverse drug experience it learns of. They must report unexpected serious and fatal adverse drug events within 15 days, and other events on a quarterly basis. The FDA also receives directly adverse drug event reports through its MedWatch program. While this remains the primary tool of post-market safety surveillance, FDA requirements for post-marketing risk management are increasing. As a condition of approval, a sponsor may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, called Phase IV trials. In some cases, the FDA requires risk management plans called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for some drugs that require actions to be taken to ensure that the drug is used safely. For a pharmaceutical company to gain approval to produce a generic drug, the FDA requires scientific evidence that the generic drug is interchangeable with or therapeutically equivalent to the originally approved drug. This is called an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). As of 2012, 80% of all FDA approved drugs are available in generic form. When its application to manufacture generics were subjected to repeated delays by the FDA, Mylan, convinced that it was being discriminated against, soon began its own private investigation of the agency in 1987. In April 1989, the FDA investigated 11 manufacturers for irregularities; and later brought that number up to 13. The FDA has a list of approximately 800 such approved ingredients that are combined in various ways to create more than 100,000 OTC drug products. Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing \n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, FDA granted emergency use authorization for personal protective equipment (PPE), in vitro diagnostic equipment, ventilators and other medical devices. On March 18, 2020, FDA inspectors postponed most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections. In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) continued inspections of meatpacking plants, which resulted in 145 FSIS field employees who tested positive for COVID-19, and three who died. Vaccines, blood and tissue products, and biotechnology\n\nThe Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is the branch of the FDA responsible for ensuring the safety and efficacy of biological therapeutic agents. These include blood and blood products, vaccines, allergenics, cell and tissue-based products, and gene therapy products. New biologics are required to go through a premarket approval process called a Biologics License Application (BLA), similar to that for drugs. The original authority for government regulation of biological products was established by the 1902 Biologics Control Act, with additional authority established by the 1944 Public Health Service Act. Along with these Acts, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to all biologic products, as well. Originally, the entity responsible for regulation of biological products resided under the National Institutes of Health; this authority was transferred to the FDA in 1972. Medical and radiation-emitting devices\n\nThe Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is the branch of the FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices, as well as overseeing the manufacturing, performance and safety of these devices. The definition of a medical device is given in the FD&C Act, and it includes products from the simple toothbrush to complex devices such as implantable neurostimulators. \"FDA-Cleared\" vs \"FDA-Approved\"\nClearance requests are required for medical devices that prove they are \"substantially equivalent\" to the predicate devices already on the market. Approved requests are for items that are new or substantially different and need to demonstrate \"safety and efficacy\", for example they may be inspected for safety in case of new toxic hazards. Veterinary products\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is a center of the FDA that regulates food additives and drugs that are given to animals. The FDA's requirements to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy are also administered by CVM through inspections of feed manufacturers. CVM does not regulate vaccines for animals; these are handled by the United States Department of Agriculture. Tobacco products\nThe FDA regulates tobacco products with authority established by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Surgeon General. In July 2017, the FDA announced a plan that would reduce the current levels of nicotine permitted in tobacco cigarettes. Medical maggots represent the first living organism allowed by the Food and Drug Administration for production and marketing as a prescription medical device. A more recent example of the FDA's international work is their 2018 cooperation with regulatory and law-enforcement agencies worldwide through Interpol as part of Operation Pangea XI. The FDA targeted 465 websites that illegally sold potentially dangerous, unapproved versions of opioid, oncology, and antiviral prescription drugs to U.S. consumers. Science and research programs\n\nThe FDA carries out research and development activities to develop technology and standards that support its regulatory role, with the objective of resolving scientific and technical challenges before they become impediments. The FDA's research efforts include the areas of biologics, medical devices, drugs, women's health, toxicology, food safety and applied nutrition, and veterinary medicine. Data management\nThe FDA has collected a large amount of data through the decades. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was put in place after a diphtheria antitoxin—derived from tetanus-contaminated serum—was used to produce a vaccine that caused the deaths of thirteen children in St. Louis, Missouri. The serum was originally collected from a horse named Jim who had contracted tetanus. The responsibility for examining food and drugs for such \"adulteration\" or \"misbranding\" was given to Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry. In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration. This name was shortened to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) three years later. The new law significantly increased federal regulatory authority over drugs by mandating a pre-market review of the safety of all new drugs, as well as banning false therapeutic claims in drug labeling without requiring that the FDA prove fraudulent intent. These developments confirmed extensive powers for the FDA to enforce post-marketing recalls of ineffective drugs. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA issued new rules to expedite approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases, and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. This drug was used as a treatment for cancer, but scientific studies both before and after this legislative trend found it to be ineffective. When the FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals on June 8, 2017, to remove oxymorphone hydrochloride from the market, it was the first such request in FDA history. 21st century reforms\n\nCritical Path Initiative\nThe Critical Path Initiative is the FDA's effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the sciences through which FDA-regulated products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured. The Initiative was launched in March 2004, with the release of a report entitled Innovation/Stagnation: Challenge and Opportunity on the Critical Path to New Medical Products. A 2006 court case, Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach, would have forced radical changes in FDA regulation of unapproved drugs. The committee was composed of 16 experts, including leaders in clinical medicine medical research, economics, biostatistics, law, public policy, public health, and the allied health professions, as well as current and former executives from the pharmaceutical, hospital, and health insurance industries. This program requires that manufacturers design and implement periodic assessments of their programs' effectiveness. Pediatric drug testing\nPrior to the 1990s, only 20% of all drugs prescribed for children in the United States were tested for safety or efficacy in a pediatric population. For many drugs, children represented such a small proportion of the potential market, that drug manufacturers did not see such testing as cost-effective. An initial attempt by the FDA to address this issue was the 1994 FDA Final Rule on Pediatric Labeling and Extrapolation, which allowed manufacturers to add pediatric labeling information, but required drugs that had not been tested for pediatric safety and efficacy to bear a disclaimer to that effect. However, this rule failed to motivate many drug companies to conduct additional pediatric drug trials. In 1997, the FDA proposed a rule to require pediatric drug trials from the sponsors of New Drug Applications. While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 reauthorized these provisions and allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a \"last resort\" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate. President Obama signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 which extended the authorization until 2017. Rules for generic biologics\nSince the 1990s, many successful new drugs for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other conditions have been protein-based biotechnology drugs, regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Many of these drugs are extremely expensive; for example, the anti-cancer drug Avastin costs $55,000 for a year of treatment, while the enzyme replacement therapy drug Cerezyme costs $200,000 per year, and must be taken by Gaucher's Disease patients for life. Because of these complexities, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act did not include biologics in the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process. Characterized as \"corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk,\" these concerns were also highlighted in the 2006 report on the agency as well. The FDA has also been criticized from the opposite viewpoint, as being too tough on industry. However, in an indicator that the FDA may be too lax in their approval process, in particular for medical devices, a 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \"serious health problems or death\" had been previously approved by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases, the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation.

Writing in The Financial Times on the occasion on the museum's reopening in 2006, Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, hailed “the most comprehensive display of European sculpture anywhere.” He added: “It is no exaggeration to say that in the new Bode Museum, Europe will be able for the first time to read its history — aesthetic and religious, intellectual and political — in a three-dimensional form.”\n\n Helenius was an artist in residence at the infamous Lallukka Artist's Home in the Etu-Töölö district of Helsinki. Her art from this period is currently on display at the Helsinki Art Museum in the exhibition Lallukka – Life in the Home of Artists, alongside other well-known Finnish visual artists of the mid 20th century. Helenius' work has gained posthumous notoriety after being written on by Finnish art historian Tutta Palin in the book Ester Helenius: Varihurmion palvoja, a popular reference for tracing the evolution of Helenius' work. Popular Swedish author and illustrator Tove Jannson has written of her interactions with Helenius during her time in Paris, France in her book Letters From Tove. Both artists are also known to have lived at the Lallukka Artist's Home. Helenius' art can be found at auction on sites such as Hagelstam & Co. and Bukowskis for estimated values of up to 2,000 euros Her work also remains in the collections of the Finnish National Gallery, the Helsinki Art Museum, and the Hämeenlinna Art Museum, among others.\n\nQuestion: Works by Hanna Leena Kristiina Varis are part of a collection in a museum that houses approximately 65,000 what?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

One traditional etymology connects it to the name of the Helveconae, a Germanic tribe mentioned in Ancient Greek and Latin sources, but the etymology or language of the tribal name remains unknown. The oldest known mention of the river or town Elbing is in the form Ylfing in the report of a sailor Wulfstan from the end of the 9th century, in The Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan which was written in Anglo-Saxon in King Alfred's reign. The language spoken might not have been Old High German, as Low Saxon was spoken there later. \"Then a countless number of people from different tribes left, took their families and possessions with them and went with Count Adolf in Wagria to take possession of their promised land. Initially, those from Holsten were given the most sheltered area west of Segeberg, on the River Trave, on the Schwentine flood plain and everything from the Schwale to the Grimmelsberg and Lake Ploen. The country around Dargun was settled by the Westphalians, the Eutin area by the Dutch and Suesel by the Frisians. He allowed Oldenburg, Lütjenburg and other coastal areas be colonised by the Slavs, who had to pay taxes to him.\" This document tells about the existence in 743 AD of a community living around the central square in Wilrijk which is called Bist. One of the current theories is that the name Wilrijk is actually derived from the Gallo-Roman word Villariacum (meaning: \"Part of the domain of a Roman villa\"). Evidence for the existence of a Roman villa was found in a nearby \n\n The name derives from either the Old Norse word Lundr or the Old Swedish word lunder, both meaning \"grove\" or \"copse\". The town was first documented in 1251 in the Chartulary of Cockersand Abbey, where it was referred to as \"de Lund\".

He is remembered for his wit both in person and in popular writings. Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Early life and education \nMedawar was born in Petrópolis, a town 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where his parents were living. He was the third child of Lebanese Nicholas Agnatius Medawar, born in the village of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon, and British mother Edith Muriel (née Dowling). He had a brother Philip and a sister Pamela. (Pamela was later married to Sir David Hunt, who served as Private Secretary to prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.) His father, a Christian Maronite, became a naturalised British citizen and worked for a British dental supplies manufacturer that sent him to Brazil as an agent. (He later described his father's profession as selling \"false teeth in South America\".) His status as a British citizen was acquired at birth, as he said, \"My birth was registered at the British Consulate in good time to acquire the status of 'natural-born British subject'.\" Medawar left Brazil with his family for England \"towards the end of the war\", and he lived there for the rest of his life. He was also a Brazilian citizen by birth, as dictated by the Brazilian nationality law (jus soli). At 18 years, when he was of age to be drafted in the Brazilian Army, he applied for exemption of military conscription to Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, his godfather and the then Minister of Aviation. His application was denied by General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and he had to renounce his Brazilian citizenship. In 1928, Medawar went to Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire. An experience of bullying and racism made him feel the rest of his life \"resentful and disgusted at the manners and mores of [Marlborough's] essentially tribal institution,\" and likened it to the training schools for the Nazi SS as all \"founded upon the twin pillars of sex and sadism.\" In 1932, he went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class honours degree in zoology in 1935. Medawar was appointed Christopher Welch scholar and senior demy of Magdalen in 1935. In 1938, he became Fellow of Magdalen through an examination, the position he held till 1944. The University of Oxford approved his Doctor of Philosophy thesis titled \"Growth promoting and growth inhibiting factors in normal and abnormal development\" in 1941, but because of the prohibitive cost of supplication (the process by which the degree is officially conferred), he spent the money on his urgent appendectomy instead. The University of Oxford later awarded him a Doctor of Science degree in 1947. His predecessor Sir Charles Harrington was an able administrator such that taking over his post was, as he described, \"[N]o more strenuous than ... sliding over into the driving-seat of a Rolls-Royce\". He was head of the transplantation section of the Medical Research Council's clinical research centre at Harrow from 1971 to 1986. Research outcomes \nMedawar was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1960 with Burnet for their work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants, and their discovery of acquired immunological tolerance. It directly laid the foundation for the first successful organ transplantation in humans, specifically kidney transplantation, carried out by an American physician Joseph Murray, who eventually received the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor on 27 February 1937. They met while in graduate class at Oxford, he at Magdalen and Taylor at Somerville College. Medawar described her as \"the most beautiful woman in Oxford\"; but Taylor's impression was he looked \"mildly diabolical.\" Taylor's family objected to their marriage as Medawar had \"no background, and no money.\" Medawar was interested in a wide range of subjects including opera, philosophy and cricket. He was exceptionally tall, 6 ft and 5 inches, physically robust, with a big voice noted particularly during his lectures. As he completed his PhD research in 1941, he did not receive the degree as he could not afford the requisite £25, to which he commented:\n\nI'm an impostor. Medawar was the maternal grandfather of the screenwriter and director Alex Garland. He even asked his wife \"to make sure that such a book did not fall into the hands of [their] children.\" Nonetheless, he also said the following, which suggests that although religion has good value for humans in aggregate, it does not help them all equally:\n\nLater life and death \nIn 1959 Medawar was invited by the BBC to present the broadcaster's annual Reith Lectures—following in the footsteps of his colleague, J. While attending the annual British Association meeting in 1969, Medawar suffered a stroke when reading the lesson at Exeter Cathedral, a duty which falls on every new President of the British Association. After the impairment of his speech and movement, Medawar, with his wife's help, reorganised his life and continued to write and do research though on a greatly restricted scale. However, more haemorrhages followed and in 1987 he died in the Royal Free Hospital, London. He is interred with his wife Jean (1913–2005) in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church in Alfriston in East Sussex. The British government conferred him a CBE in 1958, knighted him in 1965, and appointed him to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1972, and Order of Merit in 1981. He was President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science during 1968–1969. He was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science Degree in 1961 by the University of Birmingham. Medawar was awarded the 1987 Michael Faraday Prize \"for the contribution his books had made in presenting to the public, and to scientists themselves, the intellectual nature and the essential humanity of pursuing science at the highest level and the part it played in our modern culture\".

The castle overlooks the wooded Den of Newtyle, and its views extend across Strathmore and include Ben Lawers and Schiehallion as well as the Angus and Glenshee hills. was the home of the Masters of Oliphant rather than their fathers, who resided primarily at Aberdalgie and Dupplin Castles. Hatton Castle was de-roofed in about 1720, after the 1715 Jacobite rising, when it was replaced by the Italian-style Belmont Castle in Meigle, which is now a Church of Scotland residential home. Hatton Castle gradually became encrusted by ivy and a home to pigeons and jackdaws, until it was sold by the Kinpurnie Estate for reconstruction. This has been done faithfully, initially by Roderick Oliphant of Oliphant, yr and his elder brother Richard Oliphant of that Ilk (34th chief), so its charm remains much as it was in 1575, including glass hand-made \n\n featuring dry-stane dyking up to three metres high. The eastern boundary of the garden of Hatton Castle is the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, which was the first railway line to open in the north of Scotland. A variety of people lived in Hatton Castle after the Oliphants, including at least one bishop. It is recorded by Marian McNeill, quoting A. Hislop, Book of Scottish Anecdote, that the old Scots custom of 'enforced hospitality', to extract information from travellers, was demonstrated at Hatton Castle: \"The Lords Oliphant used to keep a cannon pointed to the road near by their old castle, so as to compel the wayfarers to come in and be regaled\". For example, discovery of the Eassie Stone in this region indicates sophisticated Pictish carvers who embraced Christianity about the year 600 AD.\n\nQuestion: What country does Hatton Hill and Hatton Castle, Angus have in common?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The newly formed company began to produce additional podcasts under the Nerdist Industries banner as well as producing content and webshows for its Nerdist YouTube channel. It was announced that Nerdist Industries would operate independently with Hardwick and Levin as its co-presidents. Peter Levin left Nerdist Industries in 2013 and now heads Lionsgate's Interactive Ventures and Games. Hardwick then took over, and served as chief executive officer until 2015, when he relinquished operational control until the expiration of his contract in 2017, with the original Nerdist podcast and archives remaining under Hardwick's control under the new title ID10T with Chris Hardwick. Although still technically CEO of Nerdist Industries, he considered his role to have become advisory, and no longer felt connected with the company. Since he didn't have rights to use the Nerdist name on the podcast without heavy fees, and as part of a new venture, in February 2018 it was renamed to ID10T with Chris Hardwick.

Due to NIAA rules which require a transfer student to wait a year before participating in athletic activities, Randall II was required to sit out his sophomore year in both football and track and field at Bishop Gorman. By mid-November, Cunningham stated \"I like USC, UCLA, Kansas State, Texas, ASU, and Indiana - and Oregon as well\". Cunningham was briefly recruited by Clay Helton, USC quarterback coach under Steve Sarkisian, but USC did not make him a football scholarship offer. After accepting a track scholarship to USC, Cunningham announced he would attempt to walk-on to the football team. Gorman trailed 14&ndash;12 with 8:35 remaining when Cunningham fumbled.

Also for one season, in 1956, he hosted The Morning Show on CBS Television but was replaced by Jimmy Dean. A later episode would reveal that his wife and child were killed in a car bomb meant for him, prompting him to resign from the Los Angeles police force and become a private detective. The pilot was picked up to series for the 1971–72 television season, and the first one-hour episode aired September 14, 1971. Following on from the secret history and alternate history approach used in The Memory Cathedral and The Silent, The Rebel supposes a version of the 1950s in which the actor James Dean survived his infamous fatal car crash, and goes on to become a major star, film director and later Governor of California. After the death of Dean in an automobile accident in September 1955, Bast chronicled his five-year relationship with the actor in James Dean: a Biography. After moving to London, Bast wrote The Myth Makers for Granada Television, a fictionalized drama inspired by Dean's funeral, which Bast perceived as grotesque and publicity-driven, with a shattering effect on Dean's rural-American family and his hometown of Fairmount, Indiana. In 1975, Bast produced and scripted James Dean: Portrait of a Friend for NBC, a movie \n\n The series was the result of the success of the pilot, the episode \"Jamie\" of ABC Album/Plymouth Playhouse.

The season's antagonists are the \"Red Lotus\", a group of dangerous anarchists led by the new airbender Zaheer who wants to overthrow the world's governments and the Avatar.

The idea of restraining the Avatar in X-shaped chains, as seen in the season finale, was originally conceived for the scene of Aang being captured by the Fire Nation in the first season of Avatar, but was then vetoed by the network. It was allowed this time, according to Konietzko, after he complained about seeing a shot of SpongeBob SquarePants, another Nickelodeon character, similarly restrained. Troy Island Mell, of IGN, felt that the story \"would [not] be anywhere near as good as it is without its ability to create such strong characters\". In particular, Mell enjoyed the development of Katara and Zuko throughout the first season, but thought that Zuko's relationship with his uncle was not \"very organic.\" Rich also praised the fact that, unlike many cartoon television series, Avatar introduces antagonists that have a deep backstory and \"are [not] just evil for the \n\n Book Three introduced many new characters that would recur until the end of the series, including the extended Beifong family and Jinora's romantic interest, the orphaned thief Kai, named after writer Josh Hamilton's son.

Sean Whelan is a British-American virologist. He performed his PhD work with noted virologist Jeffrey Almond, then at the University of Reading. Whelan's research focuses on using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a model system for negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses such as the rabies, measles and Ebola viruses. He began this work as a post-doc in the laboratory of Professor Gail Wertz, developing a system for expressing infectious VSV particles from cDNA clones, which led to a patent on VSV-based gene therapy vectors and vaccines. Whelan has used this approach to study the entry process of Ebola, to identify the cellular protein the virus uses as a receptor, and to study how the rabies virus infects neurons. Interfering with this mechanism could lead to antiviral therapies.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the European Heart Journal. Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes. China\n\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997, and 1999. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.

The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. GSK closed the factory in 2009. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal's peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the European Heart Journal. Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes. China\n\nIn 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK's Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997, and 1999. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

Established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, GSK was the world's sixth largest pharmaceutical company according to Forbes as of 2019, after Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, and Merck & Co. GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and #296 on the 2019 Fortune 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies including China Resources, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Sinopharm, Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. , it had a market capitalisation of £81 billion (about US$107 billion), the fourth largest on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, and zidovudine. History\n\nGlaxo Wellcome\n\nGlaxo\nJoseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. Joseph Nathan's shareholders reorganised the group's structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen & Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company's R&D until 1987. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina. Burroughs Wellcome\n\nBurroughs Wellcome & Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. In the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016 that the \"iconic building helped define the image of RTP,\" saying, \"Love it or hate it, Rudolph's design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.\" Merger\n\nGlaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East. SmithKline Beecham\n\nBeecham\n\nIn 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research. SmithKline\n\nJohn K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline & French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products. Smith Kline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to SmithKline Beckman. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories. Merger\nIn 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow. 2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger\nGlaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The company's global headquarters are at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and  was home to 3,000 administrative staff. Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK's Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million). In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. Subsequent split \nThe culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon. In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited, conditional and non-binding offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares). Venture arms\nSR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK's business. Research areas and products\n\nPharmaceuticals\nGSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes and mental health. Facilities\n, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&D. The company's single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in The Navy Yard, Philadelphia, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust. Vane served as Group Research and Development Director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985. Philanthropy and social responsibility\nSince 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 percent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 percent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Controversies\n\n1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin\nIn the 1960s Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd., 410 U.S. 52 (1973). Produced in England by H.W. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955.

Their convictions were overturned because they were based on interrogations conducted in Guantanamo, and the interrogations were conducted by French security officials, not law enforcement officials. On February 17, 2010, a higher court of appeals, the Court of Cessations, re-instated the charges against the six men. According to the Associated Press, Philippe Meilhac, Ben Mustafa's lawyer, described Clement's request as \"unprecedented\": \"This [request] is unprecedented. But it's normal that the judge leading the investigation approach those concerned at Guantanamo to verify these claims.\" Her second client, Abdal Ali Razak also known as Razak Ali and as Abdelrazak Ali Abdelrahman, was an Algerian citizen visiting Pakistan, detained because he was staying in the same guest house as Abu Zubaydah, who was believed to be a top Al-Qaida figure. Although Gorman has filed several habeas corpus petitions on his behalf, including Ali v Obama (2013) and Ali v Trump, they have so far been unsuccessful. On January 25, 2011, Kaplan sentenced Ghailani to life, and called the attacks \"horrific\" and saying the deaths and damage they caused far outweighs \"any and all considerations that have been advanced on behalf of the defendant.\" He also ordered Ghailani to pay $33 million as restitution.\n\nQuestion: What amount was the settlement that the character from the Son of al Quada got in 2017?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central pressure, was Typhoon Tip, which reached a pressure of 870 hPa (25.69 inHg) on October 12, 1979. In 1901, 21 tropical cyclones were observed in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them. The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar, before striking eastern China. Tip weakened to a Category 1 typhoon before making landfall in Japan, killing nearly 100 people. ; Typhoon Tip (1983) (T8302, 02W, Auring) – Formed near the Philippines and hit China as a tropical storm, causing minor damage. ; Typhoon Tip (1986) (T8612, 10W) – A Category 1 typhoon that remained well at sea. Typhoon Tip is considered to be both the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the world, with a minimum pressure of 870 mbar, as well as the largest ever recorded, with a diameter of more than 2,000 km (>1,250 mi). The cyclone formed on October 5, and after moving into a very favorable environment for development, quickly strengthened into Super Typhoon Tip on the 11th.\n\nQuestion: Considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone, which cyclone had a film made about it in 2007?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Bahram Chobin thereafter fled to the territory of the Turks in Transoxiana, but was not long afterwards assassinated or executed at the instigation of Khosrow II. In 610, though, Heraclius took the throne in Constantinople and began a successful counter-attack, expelling the Persians and invading Media and Assyria. Unable to stop his advance, the Sassanian king Khosrau II was assassinated (628) and the Sassanid empire fell into anarchy. Khusrau (died 712) was the ruler of the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarezm briefly in 712. Nothing is known about the early life of Khusrau, although he was probably a member of the Afrighid family.

Almost all Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory. The population (3,398 inhabitants in 2016) consists primarily of native-born Falkland Islanders, the majority of British descent. Nonetheless, the Falkland Islands have been a matter of controversy, as they have been claimed by the French, British, Spaniards and Argentines at various points. Spain, which had a garrison at Puerto Soledad on East Falklands, administered the garrison from Montevideo until 1811 when it was compelled to withdraw by pressures resulting from the Peninsular War. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. On 2 April 1982, Argentina, then under a dictatorship led by General Galtieri, invaded the British territory of the Falkland Islands off South America.

Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of The Prophet, developed into the leader of the group as early as 1808. Together, they worked to unite the various tribes against the European settlers coming across the Appalachian Mountains and onto their land. In November 1811, an American military force under the leadership of William Henry Harrison engaged warriors associated with Tenskwatawa in the Battle of Tippecanoe. In 1810, the Shawnee tribal chief Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against Tecumseh's Confederacy; the US gained victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811. After Harrison destroyed Prophetstown, Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh joined forces with the British in Upper Canada at the outset of the War of 1812. In 1800, William Henry Harrison became governor of the Indiana Territory, under the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, and he pursued an aggressive policy of obtaining titles to Indian lands. Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa organized Tecumseh's War, another pan-tribal resistance to westward settlement. Tecumseh was in the South attempting to recruit allies among the Creeks, Cherokees, and Choctaws when Harrison marched against the Indian confederacy, defeating Tenskwatawa and his followers at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. It was known infrequently as the Miami Confederacy since many contemporaneous federal officials overestimated the influence and numerical strength of the Miami tribes based on the size of their principal city, Kekionga. American expansion resulted in the Northwest Indian War (1785–1795), in which the Confederacy won significant victories over the United States, but concluded with an U.S. victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Confederacy became fractured and agreed to peace with the United States, but the pan-tribal resistance was later rekindled by Tenskwatawa (known as the Prophet) and his brother, Tecumseh, resulting in the formation of the Tecumseh's confederacy.\n\nQuestion: In what century did this Native warrior and chief, whose brother Tenskwatawa led the Tippecanoe order of battle, become the primary leader of a large, multi tribal confederacy?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Beverly seeks out metallurgical artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to “separate the Siamese twins\" and allow Beverly to live his own life.

The Acadia region to which modern Cajuns trace their origin consisted largely of what are now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island plus parts of eastern Quebec and northern Maine. Since their establishment in Louisiana, the Cajuns have become famous for their unique French dialect, Louisiana French (also called \"Cajun French\", although the dialect predates the Acadians' arrival in Louisiana), and have developed a vibrant culture including folkways, music, and cuisine. The Acadiana region is heavily associated with them. There they lived in relative (and in many ways self-imposed) isolation as they tried to maintain their language and traditions. Forts such as the Carleton Martello Tower in Saint \n\n In the 17th century, French colonists who settled on lands they named Acadia adapted their 16th-century French cuisine to incorporate the crops, seafood and animals that flourished in the region. After the English conquered Acadia during the 18th century, they decided to deport the Acadians and take their settlements, which were often built on the most fertile earth in the colony. In 1755 the British forcibly exiled the French-speaking Acadians; approximately 11,500 were exiled in total. Most of the exiled Acadians who managed to survive traveled to Louisiana, where their descendants are known as Cajuns. Shunned by a Francophobic population, the Acadians had to rely upon themselves to better their own conditions. Drawing on their experiences as fishers, many Acadian men became sailors and longshoremen. Over the next generation, some four thousand managed to make the long trek to Louisiana, where they began a new life.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the ethnic group who settled in Canada in the 17th century that participated in a conflict with Irish Catholic immigrants in the Shiners' War?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Together with Masnedsund Bridge it connects Falster and Zealand (Sjælland). It was the main road connection between the islands until the Farø Bridges were opened in 1985. It is on the rail line between Copenhagen and Hamburg, Germany. The Malmö-Kontinentens Järnväg from Malmö to Trelleborg was built in 1898. In 2000, both local and long-distance trains began running directly to Denmark via the new Öresund Bridge.

At 6072 m long, it is one of the longest in all of Europe (the longest one until completion of Vasco da Gama Bridge in 1998). It is supported by 156 pillars, and has a characteristic hump at its western end which was created to provide a vertical clearance of 36 m for shipping.

Brasenia is a perennial aquatic plant with floating, peltate leaves and rhizomatous stems. Hymenachne is a genus of widespread wetlands plants that is in the grass family. A species from the Americas, H. amplexicaulis, is well known in other parts of the world as an introduced and invasive species. Hymenachne is similar to genus Sacciolepis. Hymenachne aquatic plants frequently found in marshes and other wet habitats. They are perennial, sometimes with rhizomes. The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. Bupleurum is a large genus of annual or perennial herbs or woody shrubs, with about 190 species, belonging to the family Apiaceae. Their compound umbels of small flowers are adorned with bracteoles that are sometimes large and may play a role in attracting pollinators. Rare among the Apiaceae are the simple leaves, bracts (if present), and bracteoles. The genus is almost exclusively native in the Old World Northern Hemisphere, with one species native to North America and one species native to southern Africa.\n\nQuestion: Is the Marsilea or the Brabejum the genus of more individual species of plants?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The council is made up of Privy Counsellors, Great Officers of State, members of the House of Lords, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the aldermen of the City of London, high commissioners of Commonwealth realms, and other civil servants. The day after Elizabeth's death, the Accession Council would meet at St James's Palace to proclaim the new monarch. In addition, Australian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom are entitled to sit on the Accession Council. Queen Elizabeth II was in Kenya when she acceded to the throne, and the Accession Council therefore met twice, first for the proclamation and again so that the new Queen could take the oath.. Upon accession, a new sovereign is also required to make what is known as the Accession Declaration. This is not usually made at a meeting of the Accession Council but in the presence of Parliament on the first State Opening following the monarch's accession to the throne or at their coronation, whichever occurs first. In addition to the above oath and declaration, should a monarch have a coronation, he or she makes a Coronation Oath which contains references to the Church of England. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign. The traditional method of publishing the council's proclamation recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of the proclamation from the council in\n\nQuestion: What building is opposite the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council in the United Kingdom?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It was invented by British hairdresser and amateur chemist Maurice Ward (1933–2011) during the 1970s and 1980s, and received significant publicity after coverage of the material aired in 1990 on the BBC science and technology show Tomorrow's World. The name Starlite was coined by Ward's granddaughter Kimberly. The American company Thermashield, LLC claims to have acquired the rights to Starlite in 2013 and replicated it. Thermashield's Starlite has successfully passed femtosecond laser testing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and ASTM D635-15 Standard Testing. In comparison, the bullet-resistant fiber Kevlar fails at 27–33 J/g. In 2015, researchers incorporated CNTs and graphene into spider silk, increasing its strength and toughness to a new record. The resulting silk had a fracture strength up to 5.4 GPa, a Young’s modulus up to 47.8 GPa and a toughness modulus up to 2.1 GPa, surpassing both synthetic polymeric high performance fibres (e.g. Kevlar49) and knotted fibers. GMR was simultaneously and independently discovered by Albert Fert from the Université de Paris Sud. In 2008, graphene produced by exfoliation was one of the most expensive materials on Earth, with a sample the area of a cross section of a human hair costing more than $1,000 as of April 2008 (about $100,000,000/cm2). Since then, exfoliation procedures have been scaled up, and now companies sell graphene in large quantities.\n\nQuestion: What material did a hairdresser from Yorkshire, England invent that was named by his granddaughter?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The first case, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1915 precedent in Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio that movies were merely a business, and did not have free speech protection under the First Amendment. With the case Kingsley International Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the University of the State of New York, London won further constitutional protection for the movies. In 1959, the Supreme Court ruled that the New York State censors' ban on the 1955 French film Lady Chatterley's Lover based on the grounds that it promoted adultery was unconstitutional, as the New York statute violated the freedom to advocate ideas, a right guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. FTC v. Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., 344 U.S. 392 (1953), (the MPAS case) was a 1953 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that, where exclusive output contracts used by one company \"and the three other major companies have foreclosed to competitors 75 percent of all available outlets for this business throughout the United States\" the practice is \"a device which has sewed up a market so tightly for the benefit of a few [that it] falls within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act, and is therefore an 'unfair method of competition' \" under § 5 of the FTC Act. In United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 353 U.S. 586 (1957), the Court found that du Pont's acquisition of stock in GM had become unlawful because of its resulting control by du Pont of GM's automotive finish and fabric purchases (about half of the automobile industry's requirements)—with the consequence \"that du Pont purposely employed its stock to pry open the General Motors market to entrench itself as the primary supplier of General Motors' requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics. It explained that in both the MPAS and Standard Stations cases the Court based its finding of unlawfulness on the collective, total market foreclosure resulting from the charged company's plus its major competitors' market shares, which it found comparable to the market shares of the case before it: \"In Federal Trade Comm'n v.

The early settlers called it the \"craneberry.\" According to folklore, Native Americans used it for food, fabric dye and medicinal purposes and introduced this healthy fruit to the Pilgrims.1 Although currently harvested in water through flooding the bogs, cranberries do not grow in water. Instead, they grow on vines in impermeable beds layered with sand, gravel, and clay.They require an acid peat soil, an adequate fresh water supply, sand and a growing season that stretches from April to November, with a dormancy period in the winter months that provides an extended chilling period, necessary to mature fruiting buds.Some of the original cranberry bogs were found in Massachusetts and New Jersey, with working vines that are well over 100 years old. Other crops inherited from the Native Americans include wild rice, which grows on the banks of lakes and is a local favorite for fancy meals and today often used in stuffing for Thanksgiving.

Smith was accused by multiple women, including some he married, of romance scams. He is accused of being married at least ten times and to more than one woman at a time, and being accused of using multiple identities. His former partners accused him of using their identities to make purchases and obtain credit, leaving them severely in debt. After one former partner went to the police in 2017, he pleaded guilty to identity theft and received a 10 month jail sentence, later violating probation.

It contains about 50 species. The generic name honors German botanical illustrator Georg Dionysius Ehret (1708–1770). Ehretia alba Retief & A.E.van Wyk is a semi-deciduous shrub or small tree up to 4m high, growing in Namibia, Botswana and the western, drier regions of South Africa, and was first collected by Hermann Merxmüller at Breitenberg in the Gobabis district of Namibia. As with other species of Ehretia it is twiggy with rigid branches, its fascicled leaves showing a large variation in size (6-25 x 3-13 mm), with acute or obtuse apices, and appressed setae along margins. The mature fruit is red and shows a persistent calyx. Pseudowintera is a genus of woody evergreen flowering trees and shrubs, part of family Winteraceae. Winteraceae are magnoliids, associated with the humid Antarctic flora of the southern hemisphere. Pseudowintera axillaris, is known as the lowland horopito. Pseudowintera colorata, or mountain horopito, is an evergreen shrub or small tree (1–2.5 m) commonly called pepperwood because its leaves have a very hot bite. Because of its various uses, both medicinal and culinary, the name horopito when used in common speech normally refers to the colorata species. Cultivation\nHoropito spreads naturally through regrowth on cleared land but may often be found in domestic gardens as a decorative plant. Pharmaceutical use\nHoropito contains a substance called sesquiterpene dialdehyde polygodiali, otherwise known as polygodial that has a number of biological properties including antifungal, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic and insecticide effects.

Champion Baseball was a departure from the \"space games\" and \"cartoon\" action games that had previously dominated the arcades, and subsequently served as the prototype for later baseball video games. It had a split-screen format, displaying the playfield from two camera angles, one from the outfield and another close-up shot of the player and batter, while also giving players the option of selecting relief pitchers or pinch hitters, while an umpire looks on attentively \n\n The game was part of a series of games released under the RealSports title for the Atari 2600, including RealSports Football, RealSports Volleyball, and RealSports Soccer. The series was conceived as an answer to Mattel Electronics's aggressive marketing campaign fronted by George Plimpton, in which they compared the graphically and gameplay-wise dated Atari 2600 sports games, including Atari's 1978 baseball game Home Run, to their more advanced Intellivision counterparts.

In turn, the game has been considered a forerunner to Midway's popular arcade basketball game, NBA Jam. Emulated versions of the game were included in the compilations Midway Arcade Treasures 2, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition, and Midway Arcade Origins.

While a Nobel Prize is awarded to the author, not the work, and itself does not cite a particular work for which he was chosen, Main Street was Lewis' best-known work and enormously popular at the time. In the Nobel committee's presentation speech, both Main Street and Arrowsmith were cited. Bergson had a correspondence with physicist Albert Einstein in 1922 and a debate over Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications. For Bergson, the primary disagreement was over metaphysical and epistemological claims made by the theory of relativity, rather than a dispute about scientific evidence for or against the theory. Bergson famously stated of the theory that it is \"a metaphysics grafted upon science, it is not science\". The writer, Peter Lynds, was credited with producing an original new insight. Several leading journalists, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Walter Lippmann, former radical Max Eastman (then roving editor at Reader's Digest), John Chamberlain (former editorial writer for Life magazine), Henry Hazlitt (former financial editor of The New York Times and columnist for Newsweek), John Davenport (holder of editorial posts at Fortune and Barron's) and Felix Morley (Pulitzer Prize-winning editor at The Washington Post), have also been members.

In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed the idea for the video after being inspired from the film, E.T. He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off \n\n actress who falls in love with her co-star on set, and later realizes their inevitable end upon completion of their film project. The accompanying music video for \"Picture to Burn\" was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed all three of Swift's prior music videos. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she felt that since Fanjoy directed her prior videos, she knew how to deviate from it and what new grounds to cover. Swift herself was styled edgier than usual, sporting clothing, hair, and jewelry she was not accustomed to. Rihanna told JustJared.com that the video was filmed in a \"big landscape\" so she was the only person in the frame, echoing the song's title. Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky praised the video's simplicity, noting that it seems \"as if Rihanna is speaking directly to you, the viewer, and she is your one and only amid swallowing rolling, beautiful, swallowing landscapes. It's an effect that makes you focus squarely on [Rihanna], who's ensconced in flirty outfits.\" According to Joyce Lee of CBS, Rihanna appeared to have progressed from the \"edgy\" music videos of the Rated R singles to a more feminine, colourful tone. Seth Sommerfield of Spin echoed Lee's comments, calling it \"whimsical [and] beautiful\". It was described by Rolling Stone as \"trippy\" and \"psychadelic\" and DeLuca said of the concept behind the video, \"Since the song has a pretty distinct 80s/90s tone, I came up with the idea of making an 80's/90's MTV-style music video.\n\nQuestion: Yoann Lemoine, a French video director, has created music videos for Lana Del Rey, Katy Perry, and an orchestral country pop ballad by which top pop artist?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Rivergate Mall was built by Retail Planning Corporation, an Atlanta-based mall developer, just outside the state capital of Nashville, Tennessee within Goodletsville along Two Mile Pike. Upon its opening, Rivergate Mall became the largest mall in Tennessee, a title it would hold until the opening of Hickory Hollow Mall in 1978. The mall originally included three anchor stores: JCPenney, Cain-Sloan, and Castner Knott. Other major tenants at opening included Jo-Ann Fabrics, McCrory, and Walgreens.

Critic Leonard Maltin called him \"the greatest American director who is not a household name.\" A versatile film director, Hawks explored many genres such as comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, war films and westerns. His most popular films include Scarface (1932), Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), His Girl Friday (1940), To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), Red River (1948), The Thing from Another World (1951), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), and Rio Bravo (1959). In 1942, Hawks was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for Sergeant York. His work has influenced various popular and respected directors such as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Jean-Luc Godard, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. Don Haig approached him for assistance in raising funds for Dancing in the Dark, he accepted the opportunity to move back into more serious filmmaking; with its screening at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986, it became the first Kramreither-produced film to premiere at a major film festival. Other more ambitious films he produced around the same time included Flying, Confidential, Dreams Beyond Memory and Concrete Angels.

Chongming does not, however, administer all of the island: owing to its continual expansion from sediment deposited by the Yangtze, it has merged with formerly separate islands and now includes Jiangsu province's pene-exclave townships of Haiyong and Qilong.

Prohormones are substances that are expected to convert to active hormones in the body, providing similar benefits to taking anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) without the legal risks associated with them. They are often used to enhance muscle growth, increase strength and power, improve athletic performance, and accelerate recovery from intense training or injuries. These compounds are believed to undergo enzymatic changes within the body, converting into active hormones that interact with androgen receptors to produce anabolic effects. By mimicking the actions of AAS, prohormones aim to enhance muscle protein synthesis, promote nitrogen retention, and inhibit muscle breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and improved physical performance. One of the advantages of using prohormones for bodybuilders and athletes is the legal aspect. The Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 established regulatory control over AAS and certain androgen prohormones, categorizing them as controlled substances. It is crucial to consult with medical professionals or experts in sports medicine before considering the use of prohormones or any performance-enhancing substances. Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

Their use is seen as an issue in modern sport, particularly given the lengths to which athletes and professional laboratories go to in trying to conceal such use from sports regulators. Some female athletes may have naturally higher levels of testosterone than others, and may be asked to consent to sex verification and either surgery or drugs to decrease testosterone levels. This has proven contentious, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport suspending the IAAF policy due to insufficient evidence of a link between high androgen levels and improved athletic performance. Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone. The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, \"that which is thrown up, mound\". Androgens or AAS are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and appetite, induce male puberty and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and . The American College of Sports Medicine acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals. Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes in the structure of the left ventricle of the heart. These risks are further increased when, as they often do, athletes take steroids alongside other drugs, causing significantly more damage to their bodies. The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes. Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS. Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports, racing, and bodybuilding as performance-enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies. Uses\n\nMedical\n\nSince the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success. These can broadly be grouped into anabolic, androgenic, and other uses. Anabolic\n Bone marrow stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia, kidney failure or aplastic anemia. Growth stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure. Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS. Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. Although they have been indicated for this indication, AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects. Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma, during chronic infection, or in the context of unexplained weight loss. Counteracting the catabolic effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy. Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. Enhancing performance\n\nMost steroid users are not athletes. In the United States, between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) are thought to have used AAS. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class heterosexual men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. \"Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found. \"(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information. AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics. Another 2007 study had similar findings, showing that, while 66% of individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use, 58% lacked trust in their physicians, 92% felt that the medical community's knowledge of non-medical AAS use was lacking, and 99% felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side-effects of AAS use. A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles. AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. Dosages\n\nAvailable forms\n\nThe AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters (but most typically testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Routes of administration\n\nThere are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first-pass metabolism. Adverse effects\nKnown possible side effects of AAS include:\n\n Dermatological/integumental: oily skin, acne vulgaris, acne conglobata, seborrhea, stretch marks (due to rapid muscle enlargement), hypertrichosis (excessive body hair growth), androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss; scalp baldness), fluid retention/edema. AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests. AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. These changes are also seen in non-drug-using athletes, but steroid use may accelerate this process. AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels: Some steroids cause an increase in LDL \"bad\" cholesterol and a decrease in HDL \"good\" cholesterol. Growth defects\nAAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses. Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature, but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height. Feminization\n\nThere are also sex-specific side effects of AAS. When taken during pregnancy, AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus. Long-term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS\". There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders, but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses. In 2003, the first naturalistic long-term study on ten users, seven of which having completed the study, found a high incidence of mood disorders and substance abuse, but few clinically relevant changes in physiological parameters or laboratory measures were noted throughout the study, and these changes were not clearly related to periods of reported AAS use. A 13-month study, which was published in 2006 and which involved 320 body builders and athletes suggests that the wide range of psychiatric side-effects induced by the use of AAS is correlated to the severity of abuse. Of 53 bodybuilders who used AAS, 27 (51%) reported unspecified mood disturbance. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports. A 2006 study of two pairs of identical twins, in which one twin used AAS and the other did not, found that in both cases the steroid-using twin exhibited high levels of aggressiveness, hostility, anxiety, and paranoid ideation not found in the \"control\" twin. The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone. AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting, bodybuilding, and track and field. Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an “enhanced” physical appearance. AAS consumption leads to dose-dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus (long-loop mechanism) or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release (short-loop mechanism), leading to AAS-induced hypogonadism. Pharmacology\n\nMechanism of action\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones. However, as fat-soluble hormones, AAS are membrane-permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action. The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor (AR) located in the cytoplasm of that cell. The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways: first, they increase the production of proteins; second, they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue, so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles. AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat-storage cells, by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead. Anabolic and androgenic effects\n\nAs their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: anabolic, meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and androgenic (or virilizing), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics. Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles, leading to increased strength. The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects. A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral prostate (VP) and levator ani muscle (LA) of male rats. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. The LA/VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LAc,t–LAc)/(VPc,t–VPc). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above). Body composition and strength improvements\nBody weight in men may increase by 2 to 5 kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out. The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. Strength improvements in the range of 5 to 20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600 mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent. Dissociation of effects\nEndogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR. On the basis of animal bioassays, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic. The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays. In this model, myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle, and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles), in response to exposure to the AAS. Intracellular metabolism\nTestosterone is metabolized in various tissues by 5α-reductase into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by aromatase into estradiol, which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity. In accordance, DHT, mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT), and mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, drostanolone, and stanozolol are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics. Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic-to-myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however. It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS. However, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a 46,XY (\"male\") genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non-functional, are a challenge to this notion. They are completely insensitive to the AR-mediated effects of androgens like testosterone, and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range. Antigonadotropic effects\nChanges in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic–androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further, dose-dependently increased, and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic–androgenic ratio among different AAS. In addition, some AAS, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic–androgenic ratio for a given AAS. GABAA receptor modulation\nSome AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone, 3α-androstanediol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and pregnenolone sulfate. It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS. Comparison of AAS\nAAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as 5α-reductase, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and aromatase, in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by 5α-reduction, in their ratios of anabolic/myotrophic to androgenic effect, in their estrogenic, progestogenic, and neurosteroid activities, in their oral activity, and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity. Conversely, certain 17α-alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are 5α-reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in sex drive show no difference. AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone. AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still potentially significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility). Oral activity and hepatotoxicity\nNon-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well. In contrast, testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity, and other non-17α-alkylated AAS only rarely, although long-term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes (but at a much lower rate than 17α-alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages). Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate, almost all orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, quinbolone, and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). Some AAS that are or can be 5α-reduced, including testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, among many others, can or may modulate the GABAA receptor, and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood, anxiety, aggression, and sex drive. Chemistry\n\nAAS are androstane or estrane steroids. They include testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and derivatives with various structural modifications such as:\n\n 17α-Alkylation: methyltestosterone, metandienone, fluoxymesterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol\n 19-Demethylation: nandrolone, trenbolone, norethandrolone, ethylestrenol, trestolone, dimethandrolone\n 5α-Reduction: androstanolone, drostanolone, mestanolone, mesterolone, metenolone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol\n 3β- and/or 17β-esterification: testosterone enanthate, nandrolone decanoate, drostanolone propionate, boldenone undecylenate, trenbolone acetate\n\nAs well as others such as 1-dehydrogenation (e.g., metandienone, boldenone), 1-substitution (e.g., mesterolone, metenolone), 2-substitution (e.g., drostanolone, oxymetholone, stanozolol), 4-substitution (e.g., clostebol, oxabolone), and various other modifications. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War, the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina, but these are, as yet, unproven. AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates, and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps. Development of synthetic AAS\nThe development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition. Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: Alkylation at C17α position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios. Society and culture\n\nEtymology\nAndrogens were discovered in the 1930s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic (i.e., virilizing) and anabolic (e.g., myotrophic, renotrophic). The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid-1940s, when it was used to describe the at-the-time hypothetical concept of a testosterone-derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects. This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly, which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable. Subsequently, in 1955, it was re-examined for testosterone-like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone, but only one-sixteenth of its androgenic potency. With these developments, anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids (over \"androgen\"), and entered widespread use. Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone-derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect, it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism-based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency, including even non-synthetic steroids like testosterone. While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency, there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic, and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity. (Likewise, all \"androgens\" are inherently anabolic.) Indeed, it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects, as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor, the AR. As such, the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable, and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Legal status\n\nThe legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal. In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. United States\n\nThe history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the U.S. Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson's victory at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990. The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances, with effect from January 20, 2005. Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U.S, the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject, even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS. Status in sports\n\nAAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country\". Economics\n\nAAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.

It also serves as regional capital of Oromia. According to the 2007 census, the city's population is estimated at 2,739,551 inhabitants. A highly developed and important cultural, artistic and financial centre, Addis Ababa is a chartered city. Emperor Menelik II founded the city in 1886 en route to conquering the remains of kingdoms, eventually establishing the modern border of Ethiopia. Following Italy's defeat at the Battle of Adwa, Addis Ababa became permanent capital of the Ethiopian Empire in 1889; international embassies opened and saw rapid urbanization. Several institutions such as the house of the prime minister, Ministry of Peace, headquarters of the Ethiopian National Defense Force and federal police, as well as national intelligence agencies INSA and the NISS, are located in the city. In addition, it is the seat \n\nAs literacy and socioeconomic status improves in Ethiopia, the demand for quality service is also increasing. Introduction\nEthiopia is one of the fastest growing countries in Africa, having more than 104 million people (the second most-populous in the region). It experiences the public health problems typical of an underdeveloped country, such as communicable diseases (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis etc), maternal and child health problems (diarrhoea & dehydration, pneumonia, neonatal problems etc) and malnutrition; these account for the majority of public health problems. History\n \nIn Ethiopia, the quest for modern medicine beyond traditional practice started during Emperor Lebnedingil’s reign in the 15th century, when the emperor appealed to the Portuguese king for physicians and surgeons to cure illnesses. Later in 1866, western medicine was introduced by Swedish missioner doctors and Nurses. The first Ethiopian hospital was established in 1897, the Ministry of Health in 1948 and the first medical school in the country opened in 1964. It was only during Emperor Menelik’s time (1889-1913) that the first foreign-trained Ethiopian medical doctor, Hakim Workneh Eshete, began practicing medicine in Addis Ababa. Statistics:\n\nHealth care financing\nThe current Ethiopia health care financing strategy focus on financing of primary health care services in a sustainable manner. According to the 6th National Health Accounts (2013/14), health service in Ethiopia is primarily financed from 4 sources: the federal and regional governments; grants and loans from bilateral and multilateral donors; non-governmental organizations and private contributions. The total health expenditure per capita has increased from $4.5 per capita in 1995/1966 to 20.77 in 2010/11 and  $28.65 per capita in 2013/14.The share of total health expenditure coming from domestic sources has increased from 50 percent in 2010/11 to 64 percent in 2013/14. The main purchasers of health service in Ethiopia are: the Ministry of Health; Regional Health Bureaus; District/Woreda Health Offices in the form of line-item budgets; Ethiopia Health Insurance Agency; and, other government entities that transfer budget to service providers to reimburse service delivery cost; and households in the form of user fee. History of development \n\nThroughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrolments, adult literacy, and infant mortality rates. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea, but since outlays for health have grown steadily. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varied from limited to nonexistent. Its major themes focussed on: \nDemocratization and decentralization of health system; \nExpanding the primary health care system and emphasizing preventive, promotional, and basic curative health services; and \nEncouraging partnerships and the participation of the community and nongovernmental actors. In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. This included placing two government-salaried female Health Extension Workers in every kebele, with the aim of shifting the emphasis of health care to prevention. However, these trainees encountered a lack of adequate facilities, including classrooms, libraries, water, and latrines. In January 2005, the government began distributing antiretroviral drugs, hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults. According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, in 2007 Ethiopia had only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people. However, the World Health Organization in its 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1936 physicians (for 2003), which is about 2.6 per 100,000. There were 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia in 2005. Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for a better economic opportunity in better-developed countries. Ethiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years in 2012. Rates of immunization are less than 3% of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20% in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70% of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43%in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas were three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas in 2008. The HEP was launched in the four big agrarian regions, expanded to the remaining regions in subsequent years. It was planned to cover all rural kebeles with the aim of achieving universal primary health care coverage by 2008. Services are organized along geographic lines with construction of a comprehensive network of primary health care units throughout the country with one health post in every rural kebele of 5000 people linked to a referral health center. An implementation Manual for Pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas was finalized and distributed to respective regions. In order to expand the Urban Health Extension program in seven regions of the country, 15 packages along with implementation manual were developed and distributed for implementation in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Harari, Dire Dawa, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has achieved most health related Millennium Development Goals. Addressing equity and quality of health services are the main focuses of the new Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan. Considering the varied nature of the community residing in the pastoralist and developing regions, the Ministry of Health, along with the Regional Health Bureaus is committed to developing a unique strategy to address pastoralist communities' health issues. Health facility construction and expansion\nMajor activities under the health facility construction, expansion, rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping focused mainly on the Primary Healthcare facilities:  the number of public Health Centres increased from 412 in 1996/97 to 519 in 2003/04. There has been also considerable health facility rehabilitation program and furnishing. By 2008/09 there were 111 Public Hospitals. Midwifery teaching institutions increased from 23 to 49. If the current pace is sustained, Ethiopia will be able to meet the minimum threshold of health professionals to population ratio of 2.3 per 1000 population, the 2025 benchmark set by the World Health Organization (WHO), for Sub-Saharan Africa. As shown in the table above, this is the source of health financing that can be seen in Ethiopia, which explains that the donors, households(oop)  and Government have almost equal expenditure.

In 2002 the government embarked on a poverty reduction program that called for outlays in education, health, sanitation, and water. This included placing two government-salaried female Health Extension Workers in every kebele, with the aim of shifting the emphasis of health care to prevention. However, these trainees encountered a lack of adequate facilities, including classrooms, libraries, water, and latrines. In January 2005, the government began distributing antiretroviral drugs, hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults. According to the head of the World Bank's Global HIV/AIDS Program, in 2007 Ethiopia had only 1 medical doctor per 100,000 people. However, the World Health Organization in its 2006 World Health Report gives a figure of 1936 physicians (for 2003), which is about 2.6 per 100,000. There were 119 hospitals (12 in Addis Ababa alone) and 412 health centers in Ethiopia in 2005. Globalization is said to affect the country, with many educated professionals leaving Ethiopia for a better economic opportunity in better-developed countries. Ethiopia's main health problems are said to be communicable diseases caused by poor sanitation and malnutrition. Ethiopia has a relatively low average life expectancy of 62/65 years in 2012. Rates of immunization are less than 3% of children in Afar and Somali Regions and less than 20% in Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambela. In contrast, almost 70% of children have received all vaccinations in Addis Ababa and 43%in Dire Dawa; children in urban areas were three times as likely to be fully immunized as children living in rural areas in 2008. The HEP was launched in the four big agrarian regions, expanded to the remaining regions in subsequent years. It was planned to cover all rural kebeles with the aim of achieving universal primary health care coverage by 2008. Services are organized along geographic lines with construction of a comprehensive network of primary health care units throughout the country with one health post in every rural kebele of 5000 people linked to a referral health center. An implementation Manual for Pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas was finalized and distributed to respective regions. In order to expand the Urban Health Extension program in seven regions of the country, 15 packages along with implementation manual were developed and distributed for implementation in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Harari, Dire Dawa, and Addis Ababa. Ethiopia has achieved most health related Millennium Development Goals. Addressing equity and quality of health services are the main focuses of the new Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan. Considering the varied nature of the community residing in the pastoralist and developing regions, the Ministry of Health, along with the Regional Health Bureaus is committed to developing a unique strategy to address pastoralist communities' health issues. Health facility construction and expansion\nMajor activities under the health facility construction, expansion, rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping focused mainly on the Primary Healthcare facilities:  the number of public Health Centres increased from 412 in 1996/97 to 519 in 2003/04. There has been also considerable health facility rehabilitation program and furnishing. By 2008/09 there were 111 Public Hospitals. Midwifery teaching institutions increased from 23 to 49. If the current pace is sustained, Ethiopia will be able to meet the minimum threshold of health professionals to population ratio of 2.3 per 1000 population, the 2025 benchmark set by the World Health Organization (WHO), for Sub-Saharan Africa. As shown in the table above, this is the source of health financing that can be seen in Ethiopia, which explains that the donors, households(oop)  and Government have almost equal expenditure. The SIH system doesn't include 85% poorest society of Ethiopian living in a rural area, so I have given attention to CBHI. Community-based Health Insurance Development \nPilot implementation initiated since 2011 in 13 districts in four big regions (Oromia, Amhara, Tigray and South nation and nationality). Community based Health Insurance Design Features  \nby Institutional Arrangement\n  The Scheme is established at Woreda (district) level\n The scheme is managed by three full-time CBHI Executive staff at Woreda level\n  There is a section of the schemes at each sub-district level\n General Assembly and Board at woreda level serve as a governance structure\n Regional and Zonal Steering Committees play a leadership role\n Ethiopian health insurance agency play significant technical and capacity building role\nThe main objective of CBHI in Ethiopia \n To remove financial barriers\n To reduce catastrophic out of pocket expenditure(OOP)\n To increase health service utilization\n To improve quality of care, by increasing resources for health facilities through strong community involvement and ownership and strategic purchasing\n To enhance equity in health\n To Mobilize domestic resource\n\nMembership \nMembership to CBHI schemes is currently on a voluntary basis, planned to move to a mandatory system. Services are accessed mostly from public Health Centers and primary Hospitals. The figure also shows the improvement of Per capita health expenditure of Ethiopia from 1996  to 2013.

With its assignment to the USS Essex (CV-9) and Air Group 4, VMF-213 along with VMF-124 was one of the first two Marine squadrons to augment carrier air groups during World War II. Marine Fighting Squadron 216 was formed at Marine Corps Air Station El Centro, California in January 1943 but was not officially commissioned until September 16, 1943 with Major Rivers J. Morrell, Jr. in command. VMF-216 was the first squadron to land at the recently opened Torokina Airfield on December 10, 1943. Following this, they were based on the Essex Class aircraft carrier USS Wasp (CV-18) starting in early February 1945 and participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima. In November 1943, while operating as a shore-based unit in the Solomon Islands, VF-17 reinstalled the tail hooks so its F4Us could land and refuel while providing top cover over the task force participating in the carrier raid on Rabaul. The squadron's pilots landed, refueled, and took off from their former home, Bunker Hill and USS Essex (CV-9) on 11 November 1943. The U.S. Navy did not get into combat with the type until September 1943. The work done by the Royal Navy's FAA meant those models qualified the type for U.S. carrier operations first. They were accompanied by VMF-213. Marine Fighting Squadron 215 (VMF-215) was a fighter squadron of the United States Marine Corps that was commissioned and fought during World War II. He flew a Vought F4U Corsair in Marine Fighting Squadron 213 (VMF-213) which was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Essex (CV-9) and was one of the first Marine squadrons to augment carrier air groups.\n\nQuestion: To which aircraft carrier was the VMF-213 Marine Fighting Squadron assigned to durning World War II?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Born in Venice, the capital of the Venetian Republic, Vivaldi is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers. Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. It originated in Northern Italy at the end of the 16th century, and the style migrated quickly to Germany, which was one of the most active centers of early Baroque music. The culmination of the Baroque era was undoubtedly in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel in the first half of the 18th century. His most famous works include the orchestral suites Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks and the oratorio Messiah. Antonio Salieri was born on August 18, 1750, to Antonio Salieri and his wife, Anna Maria. Salieri started his musical studies in his native town of Legnago; he was first taught at home by his older brother Francesco Salieri (a former student of the violinist and composer Giuseppe Tartini), and he received further lessons from the organist of the Legnago Cathedral, Giuseppe Simoni, a pupil of Padre Giovanni Battista Martini. Antonio Veracini (17 January 1659 &ndash; 26 October 1733) was an Italian composer and violinist of the Baroque era. Veracini was born in Florence, Italy, the eldest son of Francesco di Niccolò Veracini, a noted violinist who ran a music school, and from whom Antonio first learned to play the violin. When his father's health began to fail around 1708, Antonio took over the running of the school, where he taught the violin to (amongst others) his nephew Francesco Maria Veracini (1690–1768), later a celebrated violinist and composer in his own right. He did visit Rome on two occasions, where he is believed to have met Arcangelo Corelli, and in 1720 he briefly visited Vienna. Antonio Veracini died in 1733, aged 74.\n\nQuestion: In what city was the Italian Baroque composer who composed a set of sonatas, titled Op. 5, born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The waves in Kauai are considered as some of the best in world and with the encouragement of four-time World Champion and Kauai resident Margo Oberg, she started surfing at 12 years old. Oberg had been a top surfing professional for more than three decades and was a mentor to Rochelle when she was first learning to surf the massive and dangerous waves that seasonally come to Kauai's north shore. “I really admired her big wave surfing,” said Rochelle in Christina Lessa's book Women Who \n\n  Surfing was of profound religious importance to the ancient Hawaiians. The study of waves was called ka nalu and the memory of notable surfing feats was preserved in chants and songs (meles) passed down since the 15th century. Many chiefs had a personal surf chant that celebrated their surfing prowess; this could be performed only by a professional chanter, one of which every chief maintained in his retinue. Despite claims by some historians that surfing was reserved strictly for the alii or Hawaiian hereditary rulers, Hawaiians of all classes and sexes, young or old, practiced the art. In 1983, he surfed Waimea Bay, a famous big-wave surfing spot on the North Shore of O'ahu, for the first time. But it was on January 18, 1986, when he ventured out into the bay with waves that onlookers said were in excess of 60 feet, that he rose to fame. He sent the story to various surfing magazines, and the failed attempt raised his surfing status to that of a \"demigod.\"\n\nQuestion: Meaning \"reddish water\" in Hawaiian, which location was Butch Van Artsdalen known for surfing 25-foot waves at?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Ships in the British and early American navies often carried goats, to eat the garbage and other undesirable food and to return milk and butter. The first usage of \"billy goat\" for a male goat occurs in the 19th century replacing the older term \"he-goat.\" And the first creature, animal or otherwise, to circle the earth twice was a (female) goat that traveled first with Wallis (1767) and then with Captain Cook (1768). The Angora goat (Ankara keçisi) is a breed of domestic goat that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia. This breed was first mentioned in the time of Moses, roughly in 1500 BC. The fleece taken from an Angora goat is called mohair. A single goat produces between 5 and 8 kg of \n\n The mule is \"the most common and oldest known manmade hybrid.\" It was likely invented in ancient times in what is now Turkey. Mules are mentioned in the Bible (Samuel 2:18:9, Kings 1:18:5, Zacharia 14:15, Psalms 32:9). Christopher Columbus brought mules to the New World. At the time, mules were not common in the United States, but Washington understood their value, as they were \"more docile than donkeys and cheap to maintain.\" In the 19th century, they were used in various capacities as draft animals - on farms, especially where clay made the soil slippery and sticky; pulling canal boats; and famously for pulling, often in teams of 20 animals, wagonloads of borax out of Death Valley, California from 1883 to 1889. The troll falls into the stream and is carried away by the current and drowned. In 1893, a live goat named El Cid made his debut as a mascot at the fourth Army–Navy Game. There were other mascots in those years, including a gorilla—the very first mascot, two cats, a bulldog, and a carrier pigeon.\n\nQuestion: Which came to market first, \"Hey Pa!

After defeating the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC playoffs, the Rams captured their first and only Super Bowl championship by defeating the Tennessee Titans 23–16 at Super Bowl XXXIV, thanks to a defensive goal-line stand. It also marked the beginning of the Rams' Greatest Show on Turf offense that would last for the next two seasons.

According to Benezit, Reynaud presumed that Paul Androuet du Cerceau, a French goldsmith and engraver, was Jean Baptiste's son, but Paul is now thought to be the grandson of Jacques II Androuet du Cerceau. He was born in Paris, the son of the eminent French architect and engraver, Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau, and the brother of the architect Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau. He worked at the Château de Charleval in the 1570s and was responsible for military fortifications in Tours in the 1580s. In 1594, during the reign of Henry IV, Louis Métezeau was also appointed royal architect, a designation opposed by Androuet du Cerceau on the grounds that only one architect could hold the position at any given time. Androuet du Cerceau's claims were rejected in 1599, when the crown asserted its right to name as many royal architects as it wished. Paul Androuet du Cerceau (1623–1710), was a French goldsmith and engraver, who was active in Paris around 1610. Jean Androuet du Cerceau (c.1585&ndash;1650) was a French architect, the son of Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, the outstanding Parisian architect of his generation. The daughter of Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau married the architect Jean de Brosse (architect), father of Salomon de Brosse, architect of the Palais du Luxembourg, Paris. Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau, also given as Du Cerceau, DuCerceau, or Ducerceau (1510–1584) was a well-known French designer of architecture, ornament, furniture, metalwork and other decorative designs during the 16th century, and the founder of the Androuet du Cerceau family.\n\nQuestion: What was the position of Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau under the man who was King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1573 to 1575?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It aims to perpetuate and spread the traditional religion of the ancient Guanche people. The Church of the Guanche People is included in the studies of minority religions in the Canary Islands. It was founded by a group of Canarian devotees of the goddess Chaxiraxi. The Church of the Guanche People performed baptisms and weddings according to what they know of Guanche custom. On 2002, a wedding held in accordance with purported Guanche rites took place on the island of Tenerife—a practice not observed for several centuries since the Spanish domination of the archipelago. The Church of the Guanche People has its own liturgical calendar, which officially begins with the first celebration of Achu n Magek in 2001. According to this system, this is the year I of the Guanche New Age. The Church of the Guanche People is a modern pagan religious body representing Canarian Neopaganism. It contains life-sized scenes of Guanche culture, and recreations of paintings and petroglyphs from various parts of the islands. It was the traditional palace of the Guanche King of the Menceyato de Güímar, Acaimo. In this cave, the ancient Guanches worshiped the Virgin of Candelaria (Patron Saint of the Canary Islands) as the goddess Chaxiraxi of their traditional faith.

The war eventually resulted in victory for Afghans, with the British withdrawal and Dost Mohammad being reinstalled to the throne. However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1880), the British and Afghans signed the Treaty of Gandamak, which allowed the British to take the Afghan territories within modern day Pakistan and took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs on the condition of a subsidy paid to the Afghans and a full British military withdrawal.

In 1926, Amanullah Khan reformed the country as the Kingdom of Afghanistan, becoming its first King. Escalated a few years after the establishment of the emirate, the Russian and British interests were in conflict between Muhammad Shah of Iran and Dost Mohammed Khan, which led to the First Anglo-Afghan War, fought between 1839 and 1842. The war ended with a temporary victory for the United Kingdom, which, however, had to withdraw so that Dost Muhammad came to power again. In 1893, Amir Abdur Rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic Pashtun and Baloch territories were divided by the Durand Line, which forms the modern-day border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The British concluded a peace treaty with the Afghans in 1880, and withdrew again in 1881 from Afghanistan. The British in 1893 forced Afghanistan to consent to the Durand Line, which is still straight through the settlement area of the Pashtuns runs and about a third of Afghanistan to British India annexing. After the war, Emir Abdur Rahman Khan, who struck down the country reformed and repressed numerous uprisings.

His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves, very similar to Trevithick's designs. The resulting design was a high-pressure steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio than Newcomen engines, setting it among the ranks of other engineers' engines in their quest to make locomotives and steamboats practical.

It is a retelling of the story of Oedipus, which is better known through the play Oedipus Rex by the Athenian playwright, Sophocles. He says that \"In the Oedipus, for example, it is hard to name any stock character except the messenger.\" In 2008, translator Frederick Ahl wrote that in comparison with Sophocles's Oedipus the King, Seneca's version of the myth \"is today among the least commonly read of ancient tragedies, largely because the scholarly world regards it as a dull and vastly inferior work\". The play opens with a fearful Oedipus lamenting a vicious plague which is affecting Thebes, the city over which he rules. However, Oedipus is so disturbed by what is occurring in Thebes that he even considers returning to his home city. In Sophocles' Oedipus Rex (429 B.C. ), suspense is achieved through a withholding of the knowledge that Oedipus himself has killed Laius, his father. The translator Alexander Neville regarded the play as a work of moral instruction. The influential early 20th Century French Theatre critic Antonin Artaud considered Seneca's Oedipus and Thyestes models for his Theatre of Cruelty, originally speaking and writing about Seneca's use of 'the plague' in Oedipus in a famous lecture on 'Theatre and the Plague' given at the Sorbonne (April 6, 1933) and later revised and printed in \"Nouvelle Revue Française\" (no.\n\nQuestion: This work of literature _______ , known by its Greek title Oedipus Tyrannus was argued by Sigmund Freud to be one of the greatest works of world literature in his 1928 article. \nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This species is considered to be extinct. The gastric-brooding frogs or platypus frogs (Rheobatrachus) was a genus of extinct ground-dwelling frogs native to Queensland in eastern Australia. The genus consisted of only two species, both of which became extinct in the mid-1980s. The genus is unique because it contains the only two known frog species that incubated the prejuvenile stages of their offspring in the stomach of the mother. The study describes the new species, Amazophrynella javierbustamantei, and provides a comprehensive analysis of its morphology, vocalizations, and genetic relationships. This discovery is important as it adds to the growing knowledge of the genus Amazophrynella, increasing the number of formally described species to seven. Furthermore, the morphological and genetic distinctiveness of Amazophrynella javierbustamantei sets it apart from other known species within the genus. Its intermediate body size, tuberculate skin texture, distinct venter coloration, and unique molecular characteristics differentiate it from its relatives. It also underscores the importance of employing multiple approaches, such as morphology, genetics, and vocalizations, to accurately identify and classify species.\n\nQuestion: The Ingerophrynus gollum is named after a character in a book that sold how many copies?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Binnie held that the word \"Barbie\", while an everyday expression commonly used as the short-form of the name \"Barbara\", had acquired a strong secondary meaning associated with Mattel's Barbie dolls, and was therefore considerably distinct. In contrast, the mark applied for by \"Barbie's\" restaurant was only somewhat known in the surrounding area of Montreal. Since Mattel's trade-mark has been widely publicized since the early 1960s, while \"Barbie's\" restaurant has only existed since 1992, Binnie determined that Mattel's trade-mark had deeper roots. Binnie determined that it was difficult to see the basis on which consumers would arrive at the mistaken inference that Barbie's restaurants were associated with Mattel's Barbie dolls and accessories. Binnie found that although both marks use the name \"Barbie\", \"Barbie's\" restaurant uses the name alongside a design. Binnie determined that when Mattel's packaging and advertising of Barbie is considered, there is considerable resemblance to the mark for \"Barbie's\" restaurant. 2011, Greenpeace activists launched a campaign against Mattel's use of a packaging supplier, APP, said to be desecrating Indonesian rainforests, using images of Mattel dolls Barbie and Ken. A Greenpeace video showed Ken dumping Barbie (\"I don't date girls who are into deforestation\"), the group created a mock Twitter feud and a stunt involving Barbie in a pink bulldozer, and unfurled a banner on the wall of Mattel’s Los Angeles headquarters; some  500,000 people sent protest emails to Mattel. After a French court decided that the Sindy doll infringed on Mattel's copyright in early 1992, the case was settled in December when Hasbro agreed to alter Sindy's face. As a result, Mattel has agreed to drop all outstanding lawsuits relating to Sindy and Barbie around the world. The case was previously ruled in Hasbro's favour \n\n Barbie's restaurant, a Montreal chain of \"bar-and-grill\" type restaurants catering primarily to adults, applied to register the trade-mark \"Barbie’s\" and an associated design with respect to \"restaurant services, take-out services, catering and banquet services.\" The applicant had the burden of satisfying the Trade-marks Opposition Board of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office that if \"Barbie’s\" restaurant and Mattel's \"Barbie\" were used in the same geographic area there would be no confusion in the marketplace.\n\nQuestion: What Danish eurodance group had a single called \"Barbie Girl\" which resulted in a lawsuit in 2002?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sims. In Griswold, the Supreme Court recognized for the first time that couples, at least married couples, had a right to privacy, drawing on the Fourth Amendment's protection of private homes from searches and seizures without a warrant based on probable cause, the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of law in the states, and the Ninth Amendment's assurance that rights not specified in the Constitution are \"retained by the people\". Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972) expanded the scope of \n\n The Supreme Court ruled in Jones v. Cunningham in 1963 that inmates in state institutions could file a writ of habeas corpus challenging the conditions of  their  imprisonment as well as its legality. This ruling reversed the Supreme Court's \"hands off\" policy regarding federal interference in state penal issues first clearly stated in 1866 in Pervear v. Massachusetts. Subsequently, in a series of cases starting with Gates v. Collier the federal government began whole scale intervention in the constitutionality of the operation of state prison systems. The Supreme Court found that it was up to the President and Congress to enforce this clause and that, as an inherently political question, it was outside the purview of the Court. The case was cited as justification for Congress' actions towards southern states in the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era. Likewise, he voted in favor of Reynolds v. Sims (1964), which extended the same requirement to state legislative districts on the basis of the equal protection clause. At the same time, Black did not believe that the equal protection clause made poll taxes unconstitutional.\n\nQuestion: Which case was decided first, Selle v. Gibb or Reynolds v.

Spiraeoideae as defined before 2007 is paraphyletic, leading some authors to define a broader subfamily which includes the Spiraeoideae as well as the Maleae (plants such as pears and apples whose fruits are pomes), and the Amygdaloideae (including almonds and plums, whose fruits are drupes). Such an expanded subfamily is to be called Amygdaloideae under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. The traditional Spiraeoideae are shrubs. Most have simple leaves, but the genera Aruncus and Sorbaria have pinnately compound leaves. Most genera traditionally placed in the Spiraeoideae produce flowers with distinct follicles that, upon seed-set, mature to form fruits that are aggregates of follicles. A traditional classification places the following genera in the subfamily: \n\n Solidago villosicarpa is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names hairy-seed goldenrod, coastal goldenrod, glandular wand goldenrod, and shaggy-fruit goldenrod. Solidago villosicarpa was first collected in 1949, misidentified for several decades, and described as a new species in 2000. It is a perennial herb that can grow to 1.5 meters (5 meet) tall. It is distinguished from the related Solidago juncea by having fewer flowers per head (only 1-5 ray florets and 4-11 disc florets). It is also closely related to Solidago missouriensis but is distinguished by having bract-like upper leaves and shorter rhizomes. Solidago verna is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names springflowering goldenrod and spring goldenrod. The serrated leaves are up to 16 centimeters (6.4 inches) long and are borne on winged petioles. This species is the only goldenrod in the region that blooms in spring. Solidago ouachitensis is a North American species of flowering plants in the aster family known by the common name Ouachita Mountain goldenrod. Solidago ouachitensis is a perennial herb growing up to about 1.1 meters (44 inches) in height. One plant will produce 25-50 bell-shaped flower heads.

A sequel to 2017's Happy Death Day, it stars Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Suraj Sharma, and Steve Zissis. The film again follows Tree Gelbman (Rothe), who is accidentally transported to another dimension, where she must relive a different version of the same day repeatedly as she tries to return home, while a new killer is on the loose. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Rothe's performance, as well as the film's shift to a more sci-fi tone, although some noted it as derivative of the first film. In early August 2019, it was announced that Christopher Landon would write and direct a new horror film, with Jason Blum serving as a producer under his Blumhouse Productions banner.

Though 'American Dream' and 'Sandbox' are autobiographical, Albee is too complex a playwright to leave it there.

The eighth of nine colleges established during the American colonial period, Rutgers was chartered as Queen's College on 10 November 1766. It was renamed Rutgers College in 1825 after Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), an American Revolutionary War hero, philanthropist, and an early benefactor of the school. With the development of graduated education, Rutgers College was renamed Rutgers University in 1924. Originally established as a private institution affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church, it is now a secular institution and became New Jersey's leading state university of New Jersey under legislation passed in 1945 and 1956. At present, Rutgers is unique as the only university in the United States that is a colonial chartered college (1766), a land-grant institution (1864), and a state university (1945/1956). Rutgers, along with many of the older American institutions (including Princeton and Yale) became co-educational in the 1960s and 1970s. In 2002, former Governor James E. McGreevey appointed a committee chaired by P. Roy Vagelos to explore the possibility of merging Rutgers University with the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). ; Hill Center for the Mathematical Sciences, named for George William Hill (Rutgers 1859), opened in 1971 and houses the Mathematics and Computer Science departments, along with a number of small Centers. The RI occupies facilities on the Carnegie Mellon main campus as well as in the Lawrenceville and Hazelwood neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, totaling almost 200,000 sq.

Schizaea is a small genus of specialized ferns in the family Schizaeaceae. Some species are very small and inconspicuous, and so may often be overlooked in nature. The genus is distinctive and not at all like the common conception of a fern, though it is still considered a true fern (leptosporangiate). The sterile fronds (trophophylls) are grass-like, and the spore-bearing fertile frond (sporophyll) is similar, but with a small, pinnate fertile segment at its apex. Various of the roughly two dozen species have been reported from widely separated regions, including much of the tropical Old and New World, parts of the Eastern USA, Chile, the Falkland Islands, and various Pacific islands, including several islands of New Caledonia, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Colias is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae. They are often called clouded yellows; the North American name \"sulphurs\" is elsewhere used for Coliadinae in general. The closest living relative is the genus Zerene, which is sometimes included in Colias. Most if not all species of this genus, as usual for Coliadinae, do not sequester toxins or other noxious compounds from their food plants. ; Helodium blandowii Warnstorf, 1905 ; Helodium paludosum (Sull.) ; Helodium paludosum Brotherus, 1908 Helodium is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Thuidiaceae.

He gained prominence for a series of novels known as \"the Empire Trilogy\" (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), which deal with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. Troubles and its fellow shortlisted works had not been open for consideration that year due to a change in the eligibility rules. In his novel \"Midnight's Children,\" Salman Rushdie uses alcohol and alcoholism to delve into the cultural, political, and medical legacies of Empire in India. Rushdie employs alcohol and inebriation as lenses through which he explores various aspects of colonial life and the impact of British rule. One of the key ways Rushdie utilizes alcohol is to examine the complexities of secular and religious identities in post-independence India. Through this literary device, Rushdie explores the complexities of identity, satirizes the claims of Empire, and exposes the health consequences associated with excessive drinking. The story is initially that of the gang-rape of a young British woman in 1942, but follows the ripples of the event as they spread out through the relatives \n\n of Krishnapur, and his last completed work, The Singapore Grip, both continue his story of the collapse of British colonial power. Derek Mahon dedicates his poem \"A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford\" to Farrell, possibly in reference to the topic of Troubles. Ronald Binns described Farrell's colonial novels as \"probably the most ambitious literary project conceived and executed by any British novelist in the 1970s.\" In the 1984 novel Foreign Affairs by Alison Lurie, Vinnie Miner, the protagonist, reads a Farrell novel on her flight from New York to London.

Concussion is a 2015 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the exposé \"Game Brain\" by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published in 2009 by GQ magazine. Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Will Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Music\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\". Release\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. Will Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized. Accolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". Slate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards.

Set during the 2000s, the film stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist who fights against the National Football League trying to suppress his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) brain degeneration suffered by professional football players. The film premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2015 and was released  by Columbia Pictures on December 25, 2015. Before his death, Justin Strzelczyk, a former fellow football player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. A final montage includes reports of Junior Seau's suicide in 2012 and subsequent lawsuits brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.

Scott was set to direct after his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, while he and Facio were looking for an A-list writer. In November and December 2013, two more NFL concussion films were in development, first Game Time Decision with writer/director and former NFL training camp attendee wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry and actor Isaiah Washington, and another film League of Denial with producers Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. Landesman had based his script on the 2009 GQ article Game Brain by Jeanne Marie Laskas. Will Smith entered negotiations to star in the film in June 2014. Smith was officially cast by the next month, when Alec Baldwin entered talks to join. In the months leading up to the start of production, Albert Brooks, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Luke Wilson, Bitsie Tulloch and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje would be announced as added to the cast. Filming\nPrincipal photography started on October 27, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and filmed there through mid-January. One of the film's key scenes was shot in Altius Restaurant in the Mt. Music\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for the film. Klayton (frontman of Celldweller) provided synth programming for the score. R&B singer Leon Bridges provided a new song, called \"So Long\". Release\nThe first trailer was released on YouTube on August 31, 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Sony released the film on December 25, 2015. Marketing included advertisements for the film airing during NFL games. In its opening weekend, the film was projected to gross $8–10 million from 2,841 theaters. Will Smith's performance was praised for being \"sensitive [and] understated\" by the Associated Press. Alec Baldwin's performance was well-received, although his accent was criticized. Accolades\n\nControversies\nFamily members of Dave Duerson, a former NFL player who suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and committed suicide, claimed the film portrayed Duerson in a bad light. In another scene, Duerson is shown mocking former NFL player Andre Waters when he filed an application for benefits in connection with head injuries he sustained while playing in the NFL. In response, Landesman, the film's director, stated that the film was \"emotionally and spiritually accurate all the way through\". Slate science writer Daniel Engber, who has been skeptical of the link between CTE and the deaths of players found to have had it, called the film inaccurate in other ways, for example suggesting that Wecht's arrest on corruption charges was motivated by Omalu's paper, when in fact it was published three months afterwards. After comparing the script (from the Sony Pictures hack) with the released movie, Deadspin claimed the movie was edited to appease the NFL, including reducing prominence of Roger Goodell and Paul Tagliabue in the film, as well as changing or removing dialogue. The New York Times discovered emails directly referencing removing \"unflattering moments for the NFL” and removing “most of the bite” out of the film “for legal reasons with the NFL\".

Red Barrels also described the game as a \"TV series\". It is about test subjects for the Murkoff Corporation in a mysterious Cold War experiment that is set in the same universe of the previous games.

It was established as a way for Woolworths Limited to enter the hardware retail market, which has been historically dominated by Bunnings Warehouse, owned by rival Wesfarmers. The two companies also compete with each other with groceries, liquor, fuel and general merchandise. Most of the stores shared the same format of conventional Lowe's Home Improvement stores, and borrowed elements from Bunnings Warehouse for its garden and trade areas. The joint venture was ultimately a failure for Woolworths Limited, accumulating losses of over A$3.2 billion over a 7-year period, and caused Woolworths to leave the hardware market, with all stores being closed and sold off by 11 December 2016. The company's business strategy was \"to offer a broad selection of high quality, brand name home furnishings merchandise at exceptional everyday values, provide superior guest service, and maintain low operating costs.\" As an online retailer, it originally ceased operating in 2018. In July 2020, the rights to Linens 'n Things were acquired by holding company Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), which was founded by former NASA scientist Alex Mehr and serial entrepreneur Tai Lopez.

The novel was adapted by Japanese director Kazuki Ōmori in a 1981 film distributed by Art Theatre Guild. After 10 years working the computer gaming industry he spent two years unemployed and teaching himself to write, during which time he developed his Stone Dance concept further.

All three novels begin from or refer back to November 25, 1970, the day on which Japanese author, poet, playwright and right-wing activist Yukio Mishima committed seppuku following a failed coup attempt at the headquarters of Japan's Self Defense Forces. Some Japanese critics have speculated that A Wild Sheep Chase is a rewriting or parody of Mishima's The Adventure of Natsuko. However, its plot, tone, and the majority of the characters are sufficiently different so that Dance Dance Dance can be seen as separate from the \"Trilogy of the Rat.\"\n\nQuestion: Haruki Murakami said that writing \"Dance Dance Dance\" had been a healing act after his unexpected fame following the publication of a novel published in which year ?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When the show returned for another NBC run in late 1956, Edwards hired Barker, a popular West Coast radio personality, on December 21 after hearing his radio show on his car radio. During the 2001 Daytime Emmy Awards, Barker told backstage reporters that his lifelong friend Edwards told him to be no one else but himself. Barker would host Truth or Consequences on NBC until 1965, and later in daily syndication until 1975, by which time he had also taken over a revival of The Price Is Right on CBS from 1972 to 2007 (Drew Carey has been the host since 2007). As a result, thanks to Edwards's \"be yourself\" admonition, Barker became as familiar with a generation of Truth or Consequences and Price Is Right viewers, as earlier fans had with Edwards and original Price Is Right host Bill Cullen during the original versions of the shows in the 1950s and 1960s. The second version hosted by Bob Warman is considered to be a precursor to the third version hosted by Bruce Forsyth, as it was a half-hour and used the Showcase range game. Having premiered shortly after Leslie Crowther's version went off the air, it retained many elements from the set and props, but was somewhat \"Americanized\". the same channel from 8 May 2006 until 12 January 2007, this time hosted by Joe Pasquale. The Price Is Right is a television game show franchise created by Bob Stewart, originally produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, and currently produced and owned by Fremantle. The franchise began in 1956 as a television game show hosted by Bill Cullen and was revamped in 1972. This version was originally hosted by Bob Barker. Since 2007, Drew Carey has hosted the program. His first episode of The Price Is Right was taped on August 15, 2007, and his shows began airing on October 15, 2007.

It has been applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics, mobile phones, and cars. The concept of Scandinavian design has been the subject of scholarly debate, exhibitions and marketing agendas since the 1950s. Many emphasize the democratic design ideals that were a central theme of the movement and are reflected in the rhetoric surrounding contemporary Scandinavian and international design. Others, however, have analyzed the reception of Scandinavian design abroad, seeing in it a form of myth-making and racial politics. Influenced by Kaare Klint and the German Bauhaus school, his \"classic modern\" designs are characterized by creative use of materials, especially plastics and wood, and with a strong sense for ergonomic and functional requirements. In an interview, Kristian Vedel stated his position as follows: The starting point for an industrial artist's work must always be that he, from his own point of view, and as objectively as possible, takes a position with regard to what he feels society and his fellow men need; he must personally take a stand on the existing possibilities and responsibilities.\n\nQuestion: Jens Risom introduced what type of design, characterized by minimalism and functionality?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The process began with Ben Burtt's creation of what the department dubbed as \"videomatics\", so called because they were shot on a household videocamera. Using computer-generated imagery (CGI), the previsualization department later filled in the green screen with rough background footage. The technique piqued the interest of other directors who have subsequently used it in their own movies. Visual effects vendor Framestore used Vicon T40 cameras for pre-vis and motion capture purposes, the same camera system they used in the 2013 film Gravity, which was critically acclaimed for its cinematography and visual effects. Future two-time Academy Award winner Janusz Kamiński served as the director of photography on the second unit crew for about two weeks of the four-week shooting schedule, in what was one of his first movies as a director of photography. Kamiński was taken off the crew before shooting was completed, but his footage was edited into the final film and can be spotted for its mysterious lighting and camera movements, though he is uncredited. Another double Oscar winner (Aliens & Terminator 2) Robert Skotak, along with his brother Dennis Skotak, created the underwater visual effects for the film.

Vincent Patrick O'Rourke was born on 19 May 1922 in New York City to Francis and Alice O'Rourke. Santiago Ramón y Cajal (; 1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) was a Spanish neuroscientist, pathologist, and histologist specializing in neuroanatomy and the central nervous system. Biography\nSantiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 May 1852 in the town of Petilla de Aragón, Navarre, Spain. Over the summer of 1868, his father took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the University of Zaragoza, where his father worked as an anatomy teacher. To aid his recovery, Ramón y Cajal spent time in the spa-town Panticosa in the Pyrenees mountain range. Two years later, he became the director of the Zaragoza Museum, and he married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he had seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the University of Valencia. In 1899 he became director of the Instituto Nacional de Higiene – translated as National Institute of Hygiene , and in 1922 founder of the  – translated as the Laboratory of Biological Investigations , later renamed to the , or Cajal Institute. Political and religious views\nIn 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a Masonic lodge. John Brande Trend wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal \"was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion\". Discoveries and theories\n\nRamón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC). Distinctions\n\nRamón y Cajal received many prizes, distinctions, and societal memberships during his scientific career, including honorary doctorates in medicine from Cambridge University and Würzburg University and an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Clark University. Even before Ramón y Cajal's work, Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen established the contiguous nature of nerve cells in his study of certain marine life, which Ramón y Cajal failed to cite. In society and culture\nIn 1906 Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida painted Cajal's official portrait celebrating his Nobel Prize win. Cajal posed for a statue that was created by the sculptor Mariano Benlliure and was installed 1924 in the Paraninfo building at the School of Medicine of the University of Zaragoza. This full-body statue that stands 3 m (around 10 ft) high on a narrow pedestal and created by Lorenzo Domínguez, a Chilean medical student. 1982 a TV mini series was created in Spain titled Ramón y Cajal: Historia de una voluntad. In 2003, the first major exhibition of Cajal's scientific drawings opened in Madrid, Spain. The accompanying catalog titled Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852-2003) Ciencia y Arte features numerous high quality reproductions of Cajal's drawings and photo essays on the restoration process. Exhibition curators and contributing authors to the catalog include:  Santiago Ramón y Cajal Junquera, Miguel Ángel Freire Mallo, Paloma Esteban Leal, Pablo García, Virginia G. Marin, Ma Cruz Osuna, Isabel Argerich Fernández, Paloma Calle, Marta C. Lopera, Ricardo Martínez, Pilar Sedano Espín, Eugenia Gimeno Pascual, Sonia Tortajada, and Juan Antonio Sáez Dégano. In 2007, sculptures of Severo Ochoa y Santiago Ramón y Cajal created Víctor Ochoa were unveiled at the Spain's CESIC (university research centre), Madrid, Spain. Santiago Ramón y Cajal Museum, Ayerbe, Huesca, Spain opened in 2013 and is located in Cajal's childhood home, where he lived with his family for ten years. In 2014, the National Institutes of Health Bethesda, MD, US, initiated an ongoing exhibition of original Ramón y Cajal drawings in its John Porter Neuroscience Research Center. Inspired by Cajal's original drawings, Kamen's and Hunter's artworks are thematically representative of Cajal's aesthetic and are on permanent display for the public at the John Porter Neuroscience Research Center. Through the award of a 2017-2018 Fulbright España Senior Research Fellowship to the Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain, Hunter continued to develop her creative project about Cajal by referencing original source material. Cajal's work was the centerpiece topic of the exhibition and the show explored the influence of histological drawings on Surrealism. The first symposium held at the NIH in 2015 was titled Bridging the Legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a symposium honoring the father of modern neuroscience. Keynote speaker Dr. Rafael Yuste was honored at a reception held at the Spanish Ambassador's, Ramón Gil-Casares, home. The Cajal Inventory consists of forty-five 11” x 14” drawings in which Hunter recreated in fine detail Cajal’s scientific drawings from primary source, and surreal portrait drawings of Cajal inspired by his photography. Every year more than two hundred four-year postdoctoral fellowships by the Ministry of Science of Spain are awarded to middle career scholars from different fields of knowledge are called \"Ayudas a contratos Ramon y Cajal\" to honor his memory. An exhibition called The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal travelled through North America, beginning 2017 in the US at the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota. During 2019, the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain opened an exhibition about Cajal titled Santiago Ramón y Cajal. From the 19th of November, 2020 through the 5th of December 2021, the National Museum of Natural Sciences, Madrid, Spain will be hosting an exhibition featuring Cajal's scientific drawings, photographs, scientific equipment and personal objects from the Legado Cajal, Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain. In 2020, over 75 volunteers collaborated as part of The Cajal Embroidery Project across 6 countries to create 81 intricate, exquisite hand-stitched panels of Ramón y Cajal's images, which were then curated and displayed by Edinburgh Neuroscience at the virtual FENS 2020 Forum, and showcased by The Lancet Neurology in their front covers in 2021. In 2017, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) recognised Cajal’s Legacy (which had been kept in a museum from 1945 to 1989) as a World Heritage treasure.

This catches the performer in the double bind of using the actor's art to confirm prejudices, which then blind their audiences to that art.\" The story also deals with \"the perils of self-invention, that have long plagued American culture\".

The speculation began in 1954, when the nave was re-paved, and the body of King Canute's reputed daughter was re-examined. A request to exhume the grave in Bosham church was refused by the Diocese of Chichester in December 2004, the Chancellor ruling that the chances of establishing the identity of the body as that of Harold Godwinson were too slim to justify disturbing a burial place.\n\nQuestion: In which county is the English king Harold Godwinson buried?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Deadlight is a sidescrolling cinematic platforming survival horror video game developed by Tequila Works and published by Microsoft Studios for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. In 2016, a Director's Cut version of the game was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, published by Deep Silver. The game is intended as a throwback and homage to classic sidescrolling cinematic platformers of the 1980s and early 1990s, such as Prince of Persia, Another World and Flashback. Set in Seattle in 1986, the game tells the story of Randall Wayne, a former park ranger who sets out to find his family in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. While the basic concept is inspired by other games of the same genre, there are several unique elements. The game features a futuristic aesthetic, with maps set in high-tech environments and in space. The game runs on the DarkPlaces engine and thus supports bloom, dynamic lighting and shadowing, offset mapping, and high-dynamic-range rendering. The developers claim that the graphics quality is comparable to commercial video game titles released between 2006 and 2007. A first-person shooter engine is a video game engine specialized for simulating 3D environments for use in a first-person shooter video game. First-person refers to the view where the players see the world from the eyes of their characters. The classification is complicated as game engines blend old and new technologies. Features considered advanced in a new game one year, become the expected standard the next year. For example, Jurassic Park: Trespasser (1998) introduced physics to the FPS genre, which did not become common until around 2002. In the game, the player assumes the role of a bounty hunter who must kill a mythical monster in order to claim the bounty and survive long enough to reach an extraction point.\n\nQuestion: Snowdrop is a proprietary game engine first revealed with an online-only action role-playing video game developed by who?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The magazine is distinguished from other magazines by its unique 10½ x 10½ inch square format, with each cover often devoted to the work of an artist. John P. Irwin, Jr named the magazine after the ancient Roman word forum hoping to capture the similarity of the Roman marketplace to the art world's lively engagement with public debate and commercial exchange. The magazine features in-depth articles and reviews of contemporary art, as well as book reviews, columns on cinema and popular culture, personal essays, commissioned artworks and essays, and numerous full-page advertisements from prominent galleries around the world. It evolved, in 1852, into The Illustrated Exhibitor and Magazine of Art, a weekly devoted to the arts, educational in purpose and offering \"culture for the little cultured\". It changed name in February 1853 to The Illustrated Magazine of Art but never achieved great popularity and ceased publication in 1854. The next publisher/owner Charles Cowles moved the magazine to Los Angeles in 1965 before finally settling it in New York City in 1967, where it maintains offices today.

In 1994, he also made Léon (starring Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman), and in 1997 The Fifth Element, which became a cult favorite and launched the career of Milla Jovovich. Jean-Pierre Jeunet made Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children (La Cité des enfants perdus), both of which featured a distinctly fantastical style. In 1992, Claude Sautet co-wrote (with Jacques Fieschi) and directed Un Coeur en Hiver, considered by many to be a masterpiece.

The USA Today critic wrote:\"'Living Proof' knows its target audience, though, and appeals to it with an earnestness made more engaging by a string of winning performances.

When it opened, the mall was originally called Rotterdam Square and owned by Wilmorite Properties (who also owned Wilton Mall in Wilton) until 2005, when Wilmorite was acquired by The Macerich Company, who then took over ownership and management of most of their properties. The mall has an area of 900000 sqft on one level with 36 stores, a 450-seat food court as well as restaurants, an aquarium, entertainment center, and a seven-screen Sony-Loews Cineplex, now operated by Zurich Cinemas (independent company). The mall was purchased by Kohan Retail Investment Group in January 2014, and was later sold to Via Properties in June 2015. In 2016, Via Properties renamed the mall to Via Port Rotterdam. In 1998, it was acquired by a joint venture of The Macerich Company and Simon Property Group, with Macerich assuming the role of managing partner. In 2012, Simon Property Group became the sold owner of the mall. Some firms use a similar naming scheme for most of their malls; for example, Mills Corporation puts \"Mills\" in most of its mall names and SM Prime Holdings of the Philippines puts \"SM\" in all of its malls, as well as anchor stores such as The SM Store, SM Appliance Center, SM Hypermarket, SM Cinema, and SM Supermarket. In the UK, The Mall Fund changes the name of any center it buys to \"The Mall (location)\", using its pink-M logo; when it sells a mall the center reverts to its own name and branding, such as the Ashley Centre in Epsom. Similarly, following its rebranding from Capital Shopping Centres, intu Properties renamed many of its centres to \"intu (name/location)\" (such as intu Lakeside); again, malls removed from the network revert to their own brand (see for instance The Glades in Bromley). Coyote Management sold the mall to NorthMarq Capital in 2010. That same year, a Ross Dress For Less store was added, along with Hibbett Sports.

GWEN COOKE: \"We're used to having an illness and getting better. SHARYL ATTKISSON: Find out how Oregon's new doctor-assisted suicide law is affecting end-of-life care. And it's not your usual high-school science experiment. Meet the teens who are finding genes. KAREN PERKINS, MD, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER, BALTIMORE: I think it is very confusing. I think there is so much information out there for patients to have to sort through, that they're going to need some help in trying to find the best possible management for them. Critics say, as a result, they need to see more evidence. MARCIA BRAZDA: But more data is on the way. MARCIA BRAZDA: But for now, women and their doctors still must find their way through a maze of choices that are far from ideal. SHARYL ATTKISSON: One of the many reasons that we offer it is to show an expression of our confidence in the procedure. SALLY SQUIRES, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, that's the disappointing news with this drug. SALLY SQUIRES: That's right.

SHARYL ATTKISSON: Do you think that down the road then that we will find a more perfect designer estrogen, where women won't have to weigh all of these terrible risks and decide what's best for them? They will just have a simple choice? And I also think there's a cautionary note. SHARYL ATTKISSON: Well, thanks for helping us understand the confusing information, Sally Squires. SHARYL ATTKISSON: Last fall, Oregon became the first state in the nation to legalize doctor-assisted suicide. Despite predictions there would be a rash of suicides, so far, there have been only a few reports of doctors actually helping people kill themselves. ANDREW HOLTZ: Gwen Cooke sometimes thinks back on her days as an actress. ANDREW HOLTZ: She left the profession, but not long ago, Gwen contacted an agent to plan a return to the stage. GWEN COOKE: I sort of got the agent on one day, and got the diagnosis the next. ANDREW HOLTZ: Gwen was diagnosed with cancer, a cancer that cannot be cured. GWEN COOKE: We're used to having an illness and getting better, and that's not going to happen with me. ANDREW HOLTZ: As an Oregonian, Gwen has the right to ask a physician to help end her life. But she's not doing that, in part because of the care she gets from hospice workers who visit her at home. GWEN COOKE: I never thought that I would be able to do what you suggested, and that is live day by day. I never thought that I would achieve that. I really didn't. SUSAN TOLLE, MD, OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY: We're doing a better job than most other sates, by most measures: more hospice, more respect for refusal of treatment, more people who want to die at home getting to die at home. Yet people on the front lines say the assisted-suicide debate has boosted awareness of hospice care and increased demand for it. MARIE MANN, RN: \"I'm going to order more of that, Gwen.\" ANDREW HOLTZ: ...and to her emotional condition. At this hospital, a supportive care team offers physical, psychological and spiritual support to patients like Orville Garrison. ORVILLE GARRISON: I see them quite frequently, in fact depend on their coming in, it's a happy type of thing. He says it gives patients a greater sense of control over their final days. ANDREW HOLTZ: Gwen says her reassurance comes from knowing Marie and others are helping tend to all her final needs. Yet, there is still sadness, too. SHARYL ATTKISSON: As we've heard, good hospice care goes far beyond easing a patient's physical pain. Only 10% receive care in an in-patient facility. Some hospices have specialized programs of care for patients with AIDS, for patients with Alzheimer's. The best hospice programs will assign no more than 12 patients per hospice team.

And it was a mother's nightmare, honest to God, it was a mother's nightmare. LAUREN SCOTT: Kia underwent three operations before the infection was brought under control. Looking back, Tammy Rusconi regrets a decision made before Kia got so sick. TAMMY RUSCONI: \" If I had ever known what I know today, I would have paid it out of my own pocket. They may in fact get much worse disease than they would have gotten as children.\" LAUREN SCOTT:Most pediatricians disagree with Dr. Spingarn. LAUREN SCOTT: Still, no one knows whether immunized children may eventually require a booster shot to protect them beyond twenty years. Given the uncertainty, many parents wonder what to do. Tammy Rusconi does not. We heard in the story that most pediatricians think that children should get this shot, so why aren't more parents getting this for their kids? SHARYL ATTKISSON: There's another controversy emerging when it comes to vaccinations for children. What about that? This data has been looked at. It is a relatively limited literature, and unfortunately it has certain flaws and draws conclusions that overreach the data. Does that seem like that's promising? REGINA RABINOVICH, MD: I think that's very promising. The results were just published this week. SHARYL ATTKISSON: Any idea when that might be available? REGINA RABINOVICH, MD: Well, those studies are still ongoing. Is that in our future? So it's very promising, but it's very early. SHARYL ATTKISSON: Dr. Regina Rabinovich, thanks so much. SHARYL ATTKISSON: This week, a Maryland company stirred up excitement when it announced plans to compete with the government in the race to find all the genes in the human body. But don't count out the government-funded researchers just yet. JIM SLADE: Early morning in a biology lab at Sacred Heart Academy, Hamden, Connecticut. Invited by a Yale University geneticist and a nun who believed teenagers could make a contribution, students and teachers have come to learn about the Human Genome Project. These talented high school students have joined a vast army of scientists working around the world to understand the genetic code that makes us who we are. Because the code is so large and their army is so small, there are years of work ahead. Here's what they are up against: Each cell in our body has a nucleus which contains chromosomes. The order in which these molecules run on the thread is our genetic code. \"Okay, so what's happening now, the DNA is coming unwound.\" JIM SLADE: These students are actually learning to sequence, or sort out, that code. Finally, the sequence is sent to an Internet site for identification. JIM SLADE: The students have proven to be willing and very enthusiastic. JIM SLADE: And with 95% of the human genome yet to be identified, there's plenty of work ahead. WESLEY BOND, PhD: It's real discovery here. So for kids who are really interested in science and want to discover something, have at it, just start digging. SHARYL ATTKISSON: And that's all for this week. Until next time, I'm Sharyl Attkisson.

The third season of Rick and Morty, an American animated television series created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, originally aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. The Community episode \"Critical Film Studies\" (2011) was an homage to this film on which Harmon previously worked. Kevin Perry of The Independent believed that the title is a misdirect as it leads the audience to expect the episode to focus more on conversation between Rick and Mr. Nimbus, rather than Morty's wine expedition. Joe Matar of Den of Geek said that the episode mirrored the season four premiere \"Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat\" in not following a cliffhanger from the previous season and featuring a storyline about temporality, Jessica and the outcome of romantic failure for Morty. Morty is irritated at having to follow Rick's instructions, demonstrating his changing character from the more meek portrayal in season one.

The beverage is closely related to a traditional Romanian drink, called borș, a fermented wheat bran that can be used to make a sour soup called ciorbă or as the basis for Vegan cheeses. Rejuvelac is a raw food made by soaking a grain or pseudocereal (usually sprouted) in water for about two days at room temperature and then reserving the liquid. A second batch can be made from the grain/pseudocereal, this time requiring only about one day to ferment. It is a popular probiotic beverage that you can easily make at home. Traditional Plain Kefir: Kefir is a fermented milk drink that is rich in probiotics. It can be made by inoculating milk with kefir grains and allowing it to ferment for a period of time. It is made by fermenting sugar water with kefir grains and can be flavored with fruits or herbs. Coconut Water Kefir: This variation of water kefir uses coconut water as the base instead of sugar water. Fruity Water Kefir: You can add various fruits, such as berries or citrus, to water kefir during the fermentation process to create a fruity and refreshing probiotic beverage. By using yogurt culture and milk, you can make your own homemade yogurt with live and active cultures. Nondairy Yogurt: If you prefer a dairy-free alternative, you can make nondairy yogurt using plant-based milk and a starter culture specifically designed for non-dairy fermentation. Homemade Almond Milk: While not a fermented beverage itself, you can use homemade almond milk as a base for smoothies or as an ingredient in other probiotic-rich recipes. Vanilla Lassi: Lassi is a traditional Indian yogurt-based drink. By blending yogurt, water, sugar, and vanilla, you can create a delicious and probiotic-packed beverage.

Reagan was succeeded by his vice president, George H. W. Bush, who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan's support.

Seeking to balance the ticket with an ideological moderate, Reagan selected Bush as his running mate. Reagan triumphed over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and Bush took office as vice president in 1981. Bush enjoyed warm relations with Reagan, and the vice president served as an important adviser and made numerous public appearances on behalf of the Reagan administration.

Elephant was generally praised by critics and received the Palme d'Or at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, in which Patrice Chéreau was the head of the jury. the same general timeline is shown multiple times from multiple viewpoints. Later, Van Sant discovered Clarke's film referred to the phrase \"elephant in the room\" (the collective denial of some obvious problem).

The elephants were driven into the stockade by skilled mahouts mounted on domesticated elephants. the capture in the trap, elephants were denied food, forced to starve and were even injured, which made them weak. Thus confined into the khedda the wild elephants were then approached by the mahouts with the trained elephants to pacify them.

Sir Isaac Newton’s celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular. The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was Eléments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. Émilie du Châtelet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton’s theories beyond \n\n  Newton's laws of motion are three laws of classical mechanics that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems, which laid the foundation for Newtonian mechanics. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no gases could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his Traité Élémentaire de Chimie: \"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.\" Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include Jean Rey (1583–1645), Joseph Black (1728–1799), and Henry Cavendish (1731–1810). She repeated and described the importance of an experiment originally devised by Willem 's Gravesande showing the impact of falling objects is proportional not to their velocity, but to the velocity squared. This understanding is considered to have made a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics. In 1749 she completed the French translation of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (the Principia), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, her translation and commentary of the Principia contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance\n\nQuestion: How did Emilie du Chatelet, Voltaire's love, contribute to the basic laws of physics?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

When working with Tappi Tíkarrass, she was heavily influenced by British new wave bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wire, the Passions, the Slits, Joy Division, and Killing Joke. The latter in particular is heavily sampled by two artists described as post-dubstep, Mount Kimbie and James Blake. The production duo Mount Kimbie \n\n Instrumental rock is rock music that emphasizes musical instruments and features very little or no singing. Instrumental rock was most popular from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, with artists such as Bill Doggett Combo, The Fireballs, The Shadows, The Ventures, Johnny and the Hurricanes and The Spotnicks. Jeff Beck also recorded two instrumental albums in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, the instrumental rock genre was dominated by several guitar soloists, including Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen and Steve Vai. Tera Melos's sound is labeled as math rock, experimental rock and punk jazz, with influences from progressive rock and post-hardcore. AllMusic critic Jason Lymangrover wrote that the band melds \"the aggression of punk with the technical intricacies of prog rock,\" using \"jerky shifts in time signatures and disjointed guitar noodling with a close resemblance to Don Caballero and Hella.\" The band's music also features tapped guitar parts, as well as angular bass riffs and splintered spazz-jazz drumming, complemented with ambient electronics and sparse vocal lines. Their third album, X'ed Out (2013), incorporated influences from skate punk, dream pop, and proto-emo. Fitzpatrick has said that the band's musical style can be fairly described as \"soul-influenced indie pop.\" He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision not to use guitars in the band.\n\nQuestion: What genre of music was played by both Tappi Tíkarrass and INXS?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 2006, Valve released Half-Life 2: Episode One, the first of two episodic sequels; Episode Two followed in 2007, alongside the multiplayer game Team Fortress 2 and the puzzle game Portal. Portal 2 was released in 2011. In 2013, Valve released the multiplayer online battle arena game Dota 2. Valve released fewer games in 2010s, and experimented with hardware and virtual reality (VR).

Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have \n\nAldosterone is a hormone secreted by the cells of the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. Specifically, aldosterone stimulates the resorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the nephron. Juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to low blood pressure or low blood sodium levels. As aldosterone levels increase, it leads to an increase in blood pressure, sodium concentration, and blood volume, thereby inhibiting the release of renin. It acts on the distal tubules of the nephron in the kidney, as well as other sites like the gastric mucosa, salivary glands, and sweat glands. Through its actions, aldosterone helps to maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as blood pressure regulation. ; Epithelial sodium channel blockers: amiloride and triamterene. The term \"potassium-sparing\" refers to an effect rather than a mechanism or location; nonetheless, the term almost always refers to two specific classes that have their effect at similar locations: \n\nThe main function of aldosterone in the body is to regulate sodium and potassium levels, which helps maintain blood pressure and blood volume. It primarily acts on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidney. This hormone influences the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of potassium, indirectly affecting water retention or loss, blood pressure, and blood volume. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, interferes with the aldosterone receptor and has a similar effect. Reference: Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium. Another example is spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic of the steroidal spirolactone group, which interferes with the aldosterone receptor (among others) leading to lower blood pressure by the mechanism described above. Biosynthesis The corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol within the zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex. Most steroidogenic reactions are catalysed by enzymes of the corticosteroid synthesis pathway that are cytochrome P450 oxidases. Aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, has several effects on the kidneys. The main effects of aldosterone on the kidneys occur in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct. Additionally, aldosterone stimulates sodium retention in the distal colon and sweat glands through its receptors. The release of renin from the kidneys leads to the production of angiotensin II, which stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can also stimulate aldosterone secretion.
