Population momentum impacts the immediate birth and death rates in the population that determine the natural rate of growth. Fertility rates must level off to the replacement rate (the net reproduction rate should be 1). If the fertility rate remains higher than the replacement rate, the population would continue to grow. Population momentum is a consequence of the demographic transition. Population momentum explains why a population will continue to grow even if the fertility rate declines. Population momentum occurs because it is not only the number of children per woman that determine population growth, but also the number of women in reproductive age.

Through science diplomacy, these entities are able to share resources, research data, ideas, and expertise, allowing for the development of effective measures for infection control and subsequent treatment. Historically, science diplomacy has successfully responded to outbreaks of diseases like SARS, Ebola, and Zika. The relevance of science diplomacy in the COVID-19 pandemic is further amplified by the need for multi-national coordination and cooperation. By engaging in science diplomacy, countries can overcome political and diplomatic barriers and work together towards shared goals of combating the virus, developing effective strategies, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare resources. As countries come together to address common challenges through the exchange of scientific knowledge and collaboration, relationships are strengthened, and diplomatic ties are deepened. In summary, science diplomacy is relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic due to its collaborative nature, ability to facilitate knowledge sharing and resource allocation, and its role in fostering trust and cooperation among nations. By engaging in science diplomacy, global entities can work together to find solutions, develop effective measures for infection control, and ultimately combat the spread of the virus. \"one-China policy\" and its disputed political status. Further afield, the treasurer of Australia was unable to keep a pledge to maintain a fiscal surplus due to the effect of the coronavirus on the economy. He was accused of making several misleading or false claims, of failing to provide adequate information, and of downplaying the pandemic's significance. On the other hand, the rise of China as a major global power has also significant implications for the liberal international order. China's increasing economic and military strength, along with its differing political system and values, challenges the existing order led by Western liberal democracies. The strategies and foreign policies of the leading powers, including the USA and the EU, will need to adapt to accommodate this new reality. It is important to recognize that the future of the liberal international order and great power competition is not predetermined.

Through science diplomacy, these entities are able to share resources, research data, ideas, and expertise, allowing for the development of effective measures for infection control and subsequent treatment. Historically, science diplomacy has successfully responded to outbreaks of diseases like SARS, Ebola, and Zika. The relevance of science diplomacy in the COVID-19 pandemic is further amplified by the need for multi-national coordination and cooperation. By engaging in science diplomacy, countries can overcome political and diplomatic barriers and work together towards shared goals of combating the virus, developing effective strategies, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare resources. As countries come together to address common challenges through the exchange of scientific knowledge and collaboration, relationships are strengthened, and diplomatic ties are deepened. In summary, science diplomacy is relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic due to its collaborative nature, ability to facilitate knowledge sharing and resource allocation, and its role in fostering trust and cooperation among nations. By engaging in science diplomacy, global entities can work together to find solutions, develop effective measures for infection control, and ultimately combat the spread of the virus. \"one-China policy\" and its disputed political status. Further afield, the treasurer of Australia was unable to keep a pledge to maintain a fiscal surplus due to the effect of the coronavirus on the economy. He was accused of making several misleading or false claims, of failing to provide adequate information, and of downplaying the pandemic's significance. On the other hand, the rise of China as a major global power has also significant implications for the liberal international order. China's increasing economic and military strength, along with its differing political system and values, challenges the existing order led by Western liberal democracies. The strategies and foreign policies of the leading powers, including the USA and the EU, will need to adapt to accommodate this new reality. It is important to recognize that the future of the liberal international order and great power competition is not predetermined. In conclusion, the potential impacts of Brexit and the rise of China on the future of the liberal international order and great power competition are significant.

The total fertility rate provides a measure of the average number of children a woman is expected to have throughout her reproductive years. It takes into account various factors such as age-specific fertility rates and the age distribution of women in the population. The total fertility rate is typically calculated by summing up the age-specific fertility rates for different age groups, often ranging from 15 to 49 years. By using this measure, demographers and researchers are able to estimate the average number of live births a hypothetical group of 1,000 women would have over their reproductive lifespan.
