On the other hand, a lesion at the stylomastoid foramen will only result in a loss of motor function, specifically affecting the muscles of facial expression. The facial nerve has both motor and sensory pathways.

While muscle hypertrophy is a well-known characteristic of acromegaly, it is important to note that this condition is also associated with several other symptoms and complications. One significant aspect of acromegaly is the overgrowth of bones, which can lead to joint pain, limited joint mobility, and an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis. Acromegaly is also associated with various metabolic disturbances. In addition to these systemic effects, acromegaly can also impact the respiratory system. The enlargement of the facial bones and soft tissues can lead to obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep due to narrow or blocked airways. In summary, while muscle hypertrophy is a prominent feature of acromegaly, this condition is associated with a wide range of other effects on the body.

Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood enters the capillaries of the glomerulus by a single arteriole called an afferent arteriole and leaves by an efferent arteriole. The capillaries consist of a tube lined by endothelial cells with a central lumen. The walls have a unique structure: there are pores between the cells that allow water and soluble substances to exit and after passing through the glomerular basement membrane and between podocyte foot processes, enter the capsule as ultrafiltrate. Lining\n\nCapillaries of the glomerulus are lined by endothelial cells. The glomerulus has a glomerular basement membrane consisting mainly of laminins, type IV collagen, agrin, and nidogen, which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes: thus, the glomerular basement membrane is sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes. It is outside the capillary lumen but surrounded by capillaries. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, whereas others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two-way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an efferent arteriole instead of a venule, as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular smooth muscle layer (tunica media). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal venule, which in turn enters a renal interlobular vein and then into the renal vein. Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the vasa recta, which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the renal medulla. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high hydrostatic pressure on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favor filtration to Bowman's capsule. If a substance has passed through the glomerular capillary endothelial cells, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes, then it enters the lumen of the tubule and is known as glomerular filtrate. Otherwise, it exits the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole and continues circulation as discussed below and as shown on the picture. The oncotic pressure on glomerular capillaries is one of the forces that resist filtration.

Lining\n\nCapillaries of the glomerulus are lined by endothelial cells. The glomerulus has a glomerular basement membrane consisting mainly of laminins, type IV collagen, agrin, and nidogen, which are synthesized and secreted by both endothelial cells and podocytes: thus, the glomerular basement membrane is sandwiched between the glomerular capillaries and the podocytes. It is outside the capillary lumen but surrounded by capillaries. It is contained by the basement membrane, which surrounds both the capillaries and the mesangium. Some mesangial cells are in physical contact with capillaries, whereas others are in physical contact with podocytes. There is two-way chemical cross talk among the mesangial cells, the capillaries, and the podocytes to fine-tune the glomerular filtration rate. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration. Blood exits the glomerular capillaries by an efferent arteriole instead of a venule, as is seen in the majority of capillary systems (Fig. This provides tighter control over the blood flow through the glomerulus, since arterioles dilate and constrict more readily than venules, owing to their thick circular smooth muscle layer (tunica media). The blood exiting the efferent arteriole enters a renal venule, which in turn enters a renal interlobular vein and then into the renal vein. Cortical nephrons near the corticomedullary junction (15% of all nephrons) are called juxtamedullary nephrons. The blood exiting the efferent arterioles of these nephrons enter the vasa recta, which are straight capillary branches that deliver blood to the renal medulla. Unlike systemic capillaries, which receive blood from high-resistance arterioles and drain to low-resistance venules, glomerular capillaries are connected in both ends to high-resistance arterioles: the afferent arteriole, and the efferent arteriole. This arrangement of two arterioles in series determines the high hydrostatic pressure on glomerular capillaries, which is one of the forces that favor filtration to Bowman's capsule. If a substance has passed through the glomerular capillary endothelial cells, glomerular basement membrane, and podocytes, then it enters the lumen of the tubule and is known as glomerular filtrate.

The nephrons of avian species can not produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the blood, but the loop of Henle utilises countercurrent multiplication which allows it to become hyperosmotic in the collecting duct.

In the case of a spinal cord injury (SCI), the delicate bundle of nerves inside the vertebrae have been damaged. Some of the diseases that can cause injury to the spinal cord include multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis, polio, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The Rehabilitation specialists will address these problems and work to prevent possible complications such as bladder or lung infections and pressure ulcers (bed sores). The majority of people who sustain a spinal cord injury are young adults between the ages of 16 and 30 because of riskier behaviors. What is a “complete” or “incomplete” spinal cord injury? A spinal cord injury is called “complete” when testing by the medical team indicates that the patient is unable to make any voluntary movement below the level of the injury. The injury is called “incomplete” when testing demonstrates that the patient is able to make some voluntary movement below the level of injury. What is meant by the “level” of a spinal cord injury? A “quadriplegic” patient has a complete or incomplete injury at the cervical level. “Paraplegic” patients have an injury at or below this level. Below the lumbar region are the 5 sacral vertebrae (which are fused together) and 4 more fused vertebrae that make up the coccyx (tailbone). The most important thing to know is that each person’s recovery from spinal cord injury is different. Signs and symptoms\n\nAlthough the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury. An individual with an injury at C1 (the highest cervical vertebra, at the base of the skull) will probably lose function from the neck down and be ventilator-dependent. A complete severing of the spinal cord will result in complete loss of function from that vertebra down. A common misconception with tetraplegia is that the victim cannot move legs, arms or any of the major function; this is often not the case. Some individuals with tetraplegia can walk and use their hands, as though they did not have a spinal cord injury, while others may use wheelchairs and they can still have function of their arms and mild finger movement; again, that varies on the spinal cord damage. It is common to have movement in limbs, such as the ability to move the arms but not the hands, or to be able to use the fingers but not to the same extent as before the injury. Furthermore, the deficit in the limbs may not be the same on both sides of the body; either left or right side may be more affected, depending on the location of the lesion on the spinal cord. Causes\n\nTetraplegia is caused by damage to the brain or the spinal cord at a high level. Typical causes of this damage are trauma (such as a traffic collision, diving into shallow water, a fall, a sports injury), disease (such as transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or polio), or congenital disorders (such as muscular dystrophy). Tetraplegia is defined in many ways; C1–C4 usually affects arm movement more so than a C5–C7 injury; however, all tetraplegics have or have had some kind of finger dysfunction. So, it is not uncommon to have a tetraplegic with fully functional arms but no nervous control of their fingers and thumbs. It is possible to suffer a broken neck without becoming tetraplegic if the vertebrae are fractured or dislocated but the spinal cord is not damaged. Conversely, it is possible to injure the spinal cord without breaking the spine, for example when a ruptured disc or bone spur on the vertebra protrudes into the spinal column. Diagnosis\n\nClassification\nSpinal cord injuries are classified as complete and incomplete by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification. Complete spinal-cord lesions\nPathophysiologically, the spinal cord of the tetraplegic patient can be divided into three segments which can be useful for classifying the injury. Brown-Séquard syndrome: hemisection of the spinal cord. For most patients with ASIA A (complete) tetraplegia, ASIA B (incomplete) tetraplegia and ASIA C (incomplete) tetraplegia, the International Classification level of the patient can be established without great difficulty. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) tetraplegia it is difficult to assign an International Classification other than International Classification level X (others). On the other hand, it is well known that muscles lacking normal excitation perform unreliably after surgical tendon transfers. These consequences are hypertonicity/spasticity, contractures, painful hyperesthesias and paralyzed proximal upper limb muscles with distal muscle sparing. Spasticity often decreases function, but sometimes a patient can control the spasticity in a way that it is useful to their function. The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned. People with tetraplegia should be examined and informed concerning the options for reconstructive surgery of the tetraplegic arms and hands. Prognosis\n\nDelayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury has grave consequences for the victim. About one in 20 cervical fractures are missed and about two-thirds of these patients have further spinal-cord damage as a result. About 30% of cases of delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury develop permanent neurological deficits. In high-level cervical injuries, total paralysis from the neck can result. High-level tetraplegics (C4 and higher) will likely need constant care and assistance in activities of daily living, such as getting dressed, eating and bowel and bladder care. Low-level tetraplegics (C5 to C7) can often live independently. In the case of cerebral palsy, which is caused by damage to the motor cortex either before, during (10%), or after birth, some people with tetraplegia are gradually able to learn to stand or walk through physical therapy. Epidemiology\n\nThere are an estimated 17,700 spinal cord injuries each year in the United States; the total number of people affected by spinal cord injuries is estimated to be approximately 290,000 people. In the US, spinal cord injuries alone cost approximately US$40.5 billion each year, which is a 317 percent increase from costs estimated in 1998 ($9.7 billion). Quadriplegia is the common term in North America; tetraplegia is more commonly used in Europe.

Signs and symptoms\n\nAlthough the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease.

For most patients with ASIA A (complete) tetraplegia, ASIA B (incomplete) tetraplegia and ASIA C (incomplete) tetraplegia, the International Classification level of the patient can be established without great difficulty. In contrast, for patients with ASIA D (incomplete) tetraplegia it is difficult to assign an International Classification other than International Classification level X (others). On the other hand, it is well known that muscles lacking normal excitation perform unreliably after surgical tendon transfers. These consequences are hypertonicity/spasticity, contractures, painful hyperesthesias and paralyzed proximal upper limb muscles with distal muscle sparing. Spasticity often decreases function, but sometimes a patient can control the spasticity in a way that it is useful to their function. The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned. People with tetraplegia should be examined and informed concerning the options for reconstructive surgery of the tetraplegic arms and hands. Prognosis\n\nDelayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury has grave consequences for the victim. About one in 20 cervical fractures are missed and about two-thirds of these patients have further spinal-cord damage as a result. About 30% of cases of delayed diagnosis of cervical spine injury develop permanent neurological deficits. In high-level cervical injuries, total paralysis from the neck can result. High-level tetraplegics (C4 and higher) will likely need constant care and assistance in activities of daily living, such as getting dressed, eating and bowel and bladder care. Low-level tetraplegics (C5 to C7) can often live independently. In the case of cerebral palsy, which is caused by damage to the motor cortex either before, during (10%), or after birth, some people with tetraplegia are gradually able to learn to stand or walk through physical therapy. Epidemiology\n\nThere are an estimated 17,700 spinal cord injuries each year in the United States; the total number of people affected by spinal cord injuries is estimated to be approximately 290,000 people. In the US, spinal cord injuries alone cost approximately US$40.5 billion each year, which is a 317 percent increase from costs estimated in 1998 ($9.7 billion). Quadriplegia is the common term in North America; tetraplegia is more commonly used in Europe.

Signs and symptoms\n\nAlthough the most obvious symptom is impairment of the limbs, functioning is also impaired in the torso. Secondarily, because of their depressed functioning and immobility, people with tetraplegia are often more vulnerable to pressure sores, osteoporosis and fractures, frozen joints, spasticity, respiratory complications and infections, autonomic dysreflexia, deep vein thrombosis, and cardiovascular disease. The severity of the condition depends on both the level at which the spinal cord is injured and the extent of the injury. An individual with an injury at C1 (the highest cervical vertebra, at the base of the skull) will probably lose function from the neck down and be ventilator-dependent. A complete severing of the spinal cord will result in complete loss of function from that vertebra down. A common misconception with tetraplegia is that the victim cannot move legs, arms or any of the major function; this is often not the case. Some individuals with tetraplegia can walk and use their hands, as though they did not have a spinal cord injury, while others may use wheelchairs and they can still have function of their arms and mild finger movement; again, that varies on the spinal cord damage. It is common to have movement in limbs, such as the ability to move the arms but not the hands, or to be able to use the fingers but not to the same extent as before the injury. Furthermore, the deficit in the limbs may not be the same on both sides of the body; either left or right side may be more affected, depending on the location of the lesion on the spinal cord. Causes\n\nTetraplegia is caused by damage to the brain or the spinal cord at a high level. Typical causes of this damage are trauma (such as a traffic collision, diving into shallow water, a fall, a sports injury), disease (such as transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or polio), or congenital disorders (such as muscular dystrophy). Tetraplegia is defined in many ways; C1–C4 usually affects arm movement more so than a C5–C7 injury; however, all tetraplegics have or have had some kind of finger dysfunction. So, it is not uncommon to have a tetraplegic with fully functional arms but no nervous control of their fingers and thumbs. It is possible to suffer a broken neck without becoming tetraplegic if the vertebrae are fractured or dislocated but the spinal cord is not damaged. Conversely, it is possible to injure the spinal cord without breaking the spine, for example when a ruptured disc or bone spur on the vertebra protrudes into the spinal column.

        "context": "Note: Spinal cord injury is very different from injuries such as fractured vertebrae, pinched nerves, spinal stenosis or ruptured disks. In the case of a spinal cord injury (SCI), the delicate bundle of nerves inside the vertebrae have been damaged. Some of the diseases that can cause injury to the spinal cord include multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis, polio, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). The Rehabilitation specialists will address these problems and work to prevent possible complications such as bladder or lung infections and pressure ulcers (bed sores). The majority of people who sustain a spinal cord injury are young adults between the ages of 16 and 30 because of riskier behaviors. What is a “complete” or “incomplete” spinal cord injury? A spinal cord injury is called “complete” when testing by the medical team indicates that the patient is unable to make any voluntary movement below the level of the injury. The injury is called “incomplete” when testing demonstrates that the patient is able to make some voluntary movement below the level of injury. What is meant by the “level” of a spinal cord injury? A “quadriplegic” patient has a complete or incomplete injury at the cervical level. “Paraplegic” patients have an injury at or below this level. Below the lumbar region are the 5 sacral vertebrae (which are fused together) and 4 more fused vertebrae that make up the coccyx (tailbone). The most important thing to know is that each person’s recovery from spinal cord injury is different.

The four abdominal quadrants are determined by a horizontal line and a vertical line that intersect at the umbilicus. On the other hand, the nine abdominal regions are defined as follows:\n\n1. Right hypochondriac region: Situated on the right side of the epigastric region, above the umbilicus, and contains the liver and gallbladder. Umbilical region: Located around the umbilicus or navel and contains the small intestine and transverse colon. Right lumbar region: Situated on the right side of the umbilical region and contains the ascending colon. Left lumbar region: Found on the left side of the umbilical region and contains the descending colon. Hypogastric region: Located in the lower middle part of the abdomen, below the umbilicus, and includes the urinary bladder and reproductive organs. Right iliac region: Situated on the right side of the hypogastric region and contains the cecum and appendix. These divisions are used to help pinpoint specific anatomical features and identify areas of abnormalities or disease processes within the abdomen. The lower opening of the thorax is formed by the twelfth thoracic vertebra behind, by the eleventh and twelfth ribs at the sides, and in front by the cartilages of the tenth, ninth, eighth, and seventh ribs, which ascend on either side and form an angle, the infrasternal angle or subcostal angle, into the apex of which the xiphoid process projects. the lateral end of the clavicle is rotated anteriorly so that the clavicle lies in a frontal plane. While this slightly closes the angle between the clavicle and the scapula, it also widens the shoulder. During this tilting, the scapula rotates to a maximum angle of 60° about an axis passing perpendicularly through the bone slightly below the spine; this causes the inferior angle to move 10 to 12 cm and the lateral angle 5 to 6 cm. The falciform ligament stretches obliquely from the front to the back of the abdomen, with one surface in contact with the peritoneum behind the right rectus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm, and the other in contact with the left lobe of the liver. The ligament stretches from the underside of the diaphragm to the posterior surface of the sheath of the right rectus abdominis muscle, as low down as the umbilicus; by its right margin it extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, as far back as the posterior surface. The abdomen can be divided into quadrants using a vertical median plane and a horizontal transumbilical plane that passes through the umbilicus. The lower edge of the liver can be palpated below the right costal margin when the patient takes a deep breath. Additionally, the gallbladder is also located in this quadrant. Moving to the right lower quadrant, you can find the cecum and appendix. McBurney's point, which is one-third of the way up along a line from the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus, is a common surface projection of the appendix. Another method involves dividing the abdomen into nine regions using sagittal and transverse planes. The three central regions are the epigastric, umbilical, and pubic regions, while the three regions on each side are the hypochondrium, flank, and groin regions. The pain from the abdominal part of the foregut is referred to the epigastric region, pain from the midgut is referred to the umbilical region, and pain from the hindgut is referred to the pubic region.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about anatomy.

In the case of fine motor movements involving the distal muscles of the limbs, such as the fingers and hands, the cerebral cortex influences muscle activity more directly. When the Golgi tendon organs in these muscles are stretched, type Ib afferent sensory nerves are activated. However, in the specific context of fine motor movements of the distal muscles of the limbs, the cerebral cortex directly influences muscle activity to achieve precise control and coordination. Rather, they reflect the coordinated activity of large groups of muscles.Normal movements (or postures), however, are rarely, if ever, caused by the isolated contraction of an individual muscle.Motor neurons to muscles of the distal part of the limb are located most laterally, whereas those that innervate more proximal muscles are located more medially (\n\nFig. In general, interneurons that supply the limb muscles are located mainly in the lateral parts of the deep dorsal horn and the intermediate region between the dorsal and ventral horns. All of these interneurons receive synaptic connections from primary afferent fibers and from the axons of pathways that descend from the brain, and thus they are part of both spinal reflex arcs and descending motor control pathways. An important aspect of interneuronal systems is that the laterally placed interneurons project ipsilaterally to motor neurons that supply the distal or the proximal limb muscles, whereas the medial interneurons project bilaterally. This arrangement of the lateral interneurons allows the limbs to be controlled independently. In contrast, the bilateral arrangement of the medial interneurons allows bilateral control of motor neurons to the axial muscles to provide postural support to the trunk and neck. Although motor neurons are the final common pathway from the CNS to muscles and thus shape how neuronal activity is transformed into muscular contraction, each motor neuron directly acts on only a single muscle. The SMA mediates muscle contractions of the axial (trunk) and proximal limb (girdle) musculature (i.e., the muscles controlling movements of the arm and thigh). Interestingly, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed that during execution of a complex movement, both the supplementary motor cortex and the primary motor and are involved and become active, whereas when an individual merely mentally practices the movement, only the supplementary motor cortex is active, and the primary motor cortex is quiescent.

Very rarely, since the defect contains salivary gland tissue, salivary gland tumors can occur within an established defect but there is likely no difference in the risk of neoplasia in salivary gland tissue at other sites. Oral and maxillofacial pathology refers to the diseases of the mouth (\"oral cavity\" or \"stoma\"), jaws (\"maxillae\" or \"gnath\") and related structures such as salivary glands, temporomandibular joints, facial muscles and perioral skin (the skin around the mouth). It is also prone to a variety of medical and dental disorders. It is sometimes considered to be a specialty of dentistry and pathology. ear, nose and throat) in addition to maxillofacial disorders. Diagnosis \nThe key to any diagnosis is thorough medical, dental, social and psychological history as well as assessing certain lifestyle risk factors that may be involved in disease processes. This is followed by a thorough clinical investigation including extra-oral and intra-oral hard and soft tissues. It is sometimes the case that a diagnosis and treatment regime are possible to determine from history and examination, however it is good practice to compile a list of differential diagnoses. There are many types of investigations in diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial diseases, including screening tests, imaging (radiographs, CBCT, CT, MRI, ultrasound) and histopathology (biopsy). Biopsy \nA biopsy is indicated when the patient's clinical presentation, past history or imaging studies do not allow a definitive diagnosis. Examples of the most common tissues examined by means of a biopsy include oral and sinus mucosa, bone, soft tissue, skin and lymph nodes. This method is preferred, if the lesions are approximately 1 cm or less in diameter, clinically and seemingly benign and surgically accessible. If the tumour is deeper inside the mouth or throat, the biopsy may need to be performed in an operating room. Diseases\nOral and maxillofacial pathology can involve many different types of tissues of the head. A great many diseases involve the mouth, jaws and orofacial skin. The following list is a general outline of pathologies that can affect oral and maxillofacial region; some are more common than others. The most common form is combined cleft lip and palate and it accounts for approximately 50% of the cases whereas isolated cleft lip concerns 20% of the patients. One of the major goals in the treatment of patients with cleft is to enhance social acceptance by surgical reconstruction. Some examples include food going up into the nasal cavity during swallowing as the soft palate is not present to close the cavity during the process. Macroglossia \nIs a rare condition, categorised by tongue enlargement which will eventually create a crenated border in relation to the embrasures between the teeth. Hereditary Cause \n Vascular malformations \n Down syndrome\n Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome \n Duchenne muscular dystrophy \n Neurofibromatosis type Is\n\nAcquired Causes \n\n Carcinoma \n Lingual Thyroid \n Myxedema\n Amyloidosis\n\nConsequences \n Noisy breaths, obstructs airway if severe \n Drooling \n Difficult in eating\n Lisping speech \n Open-bite\n Protruding tongue, may ulcerate and undergo necrosis\n\nTreatments \nFor mild cases, surgical treatment is not mandatory but if speech is affected, speech therapy may be useful. Reduction glossectomy may be required for severe cases. Ankyloglossia\n\nStafne defect\n\nTorus palatinus\n\nTorus mandibularis\n\nEagle syndrome, \nIs a condition where there is an abnormal ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. This leads to an increase in the thickness and the length of the stylohyoid process and the ligament. Eagle syndrome occurs due to elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. Usually normal stylohyoid process is 2.5–3 cm in length, if the length is longer than 3 cm, it is classified as an elongated stylohyoid process. Acquired\n\nVascular\n\nInfective\n\nBacterial\n (Plaque-induced) gingivitis—A common periodontal (gum) disease is Gingivitis. Periodontal refers to the area the infection affects, which include the teeth, gums, and tissues surrounding the teeth. Treatment of gingivitis is dependent on how severe and how far the disease has progressed. The condition involves the release of pyrogenic and erythrogenic endotoxins from the immune system. It starts as tonsilitis and pharyngitis before involving the soft palate and the tongue. If not treated, late stages of this condition may include a furred, raw, red tongue. Viral\n Herpes simplex (infection with herpes simplex virus, or HSV) is very common in the mouth and lips. Mumps of the salivary glands is a viral infection of the parotid glands. There is no specific treatment for mumps except for hydration and painkillers with complete recovery ranging from 5–10 days. Sometimes mumps can cause inflammation of the brain, pancreatitis, testicular swelling or hearing loss. Individuals who have undergone a transplant, HIV, cancer or use corticosteroids commonly develop candida of the mouth and oral cavity. Other risk factors are dentures and tongue piercing. Autoimmune\n Sjögren syndrome\n\nMetabolic\n\nInflammatory\n Angioedema\n\nNeurological\n\nNeoplastic\n\n Oral cancer may occur on the lips, tongue, gums, floor of the mouth or inside the cheeks. The majority of cancers of the mouth are squamous cell carcinoma. Oral cancers are usually painless in the initial stages or may appear like an ulcer. If you have a suspicious mass or ulcer on the mouth which has been persistent, then you should always get a dentist to look at it. Degenerative\n\nEnvironmental\n\nUnknown\nThere are many oral and maxillofacial pathologies which are not fully understood. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a disorder where there is a burning sensation in the mouth that has no identifiable medical or dental cause. BMS has been hypothesized to be linked to a variety of factors such as the menopause, dry mouth (xerostomia) and allergies. Aphthous stomatitis is a condition where ulcers (canker sores) appear on the inside of the mouth, lips and on tongue. Unlike herpes sores, canker sores are always found inside the mouth and are usually less painful. Good oral hygiene does help but sometime one may have to use a topical corticosteroid. Migratory stomatitis is a condition that involves the tongue and other oral mucosa. When other oral mucosa, beside the dorsal and lateral tongue, are involved, the term migratory stomatitis (or ectopic geographic tongue) is preferred. In this condition, lesions infrequently involve also the ventral tongue and buccal or labial mucosa. They are rarely reported on the soft palate and floor of the mouth. Oral pathology is a closely allied speciality with oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine. The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of oral mucosal diseases are in the scope of oral & maxillofacial pathology specialists and oral medicine practitioners, both disciplines of dentistry. The American Dental Association uses the term oral and maxillofacial pathology, and describes it as \"the specialty of dentistry and pathology which deals with the nature, identification, and management of diseases affecting the oral and maxillofacial regions.

Diagnosis \nThe key to any diagnosis is thorough medical, dental, social and psychological history as well as assessing certain lifestyle risk factors that may be involved in disease processes. This is followed by a thorough clinical investigation including extra-oral and intra-oral hard and soft tissues. It is sometimes the case that a diagnosis and treatment regime are possible to determine from history and examination, however it is good practice to compile a list of differential diagnoses. There are many types of investigations in diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial diseases, including screening tests, imaging (radiographs, CBCT, CT, MRI, ultrasound) and histopathology (biopsy). Biopsy \nA biopsy is indicated when the patient's clinical presentation, past history or imaging studies do not allow a definitive diagnosis. Examples of the most common tissues examined by means of a biopsy include oral and sinus mucosa, bone, soft tissue, skin and lymph nodes. This method is preferred, if the lesions are approximately 1 cm or less in diameter, clinically and seemingly benign and surgically accessible. If the tumour is deeper inside the mouth or throat, the biopsy may need to be performed in an operating room. Diseases\nOral and maxillofacial pathology can involve many different types of tissues of the head. A great many diseases involve the mouth, jaws and orofacial skin. The following list is a general outline of pathologies that can affect oral and maxillofacial region; some are more common than others. The most common form is combined cleft lip and palate and it accounts for approximately 50% of the cases whereas isolated cleft lip concerns 20% of the patients. One of the major goals in the treatment of patients with cleft is to enhance social acceptance by surgical reconstruction. Some examples include food going up into the nasal cavity during swallowing as the soft palate is not present to close the cavity during the process. Macroglossia \nIs a rare condition, categorised by tongue enlargement which will eventually create a crenated border in relation to the embrasures between the teeth. Hereditary Cause \n Vascular malformations \n Down syndrome\n Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome \n Duchenne muscular dystrophy \n Neurofibromatosis type Is\n\nAcquired Causes \n\n Carcinoma \n Lingual Thyroid \n Myxedema\n Amyloidosis\n\nConsequences \n Noisy breaths, obstructs airway if severe \n Drooling \n Difficult in eating\n Lisping speech \n Open-bite\n Protruding tongue, may ulcerate and undergo necrosis\n\nTreatments \nFor mild cases, surgical treatment is not mandatory but if speech is affected, speech therapy may be useful. Reduction glossectomy may be required for severe cases. Ankyloglossia\n\nStafne defect\n\nTorus palatinus\n\nTorus mandibularis\n\nEagle syndrome, \nIs a condition where there is an abnormal ossification of the stylohyoid ligament. This leads to an increase in the thickness and the length of the stylohyoid process and the ligament. Eagle syndrome occurs due to elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. Usually normal stylohyoid process is 2.5–3 cm in length, if the length is longer than 3 cm, it is classified as an elongated stylohyoid process. Acquired\n\nVascular\n\nInfective\n\nBacterial\n (Plaque-induced) gingivitis—A common periodontal (gum) disease is Gingivitis. Periodontal refers to the area the infection affects, which include the teeth, gums, and tissues surrounding the teeth. Treatment of gingivitis is dependent on how severe and how far the disease has progressed. The condition involves the release of pyrogenic and erythrogenic endotoxins from the immune system. It starts as tonsilitis and pharyngitis before involving the soft palate and the tongue. If not treated, late stages of this condition may include a furred, raw, red tongue. Viral\n Herpes simplex (infection with herpes simplex virus, or HSV) is very common in the mouth and lips. Mumps of the salivary glands is a viral infection of the parotid glands. There is no specific treatment for mumps except for hydration and painkillers with complete recovery ranging from 5–10 days. Sometimes mumps can cause inflammation of the brain, pancreatitis, testicular swelling or hearing loss. Individuals who have undergone a transplant, HIV, cancer or use corticosteroids commonly develop candida of the mouth and oral cavity. Other risk factors are dentures and tongue piercing. Autoimmune\n Sjögren syndrome\n\nMetabolic\n\nInflammatory\n Angioedema\n\nNeurological\n\nNeoplastic\n\n Oral cancer may occur on the lips, tongue, gums, floor of the mouth or inside the cheeks. The majority of cancers of the mouth are squamous cell carcinoma. Oral cancers are usually painless in the initial stages or may appear like an ulcer.

This leads to an increase in the thickness and the length of the stylohyoid process and the ligament. Eagle syndrome occurs due to elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. Usually normal stylohyoid process is 2.5–3 cm in length, if the length is longer than 3 cm, it is classified as an elongated stylohyoid process. Acquired\n\nVascular\n\nInfective\n\nBacterial\n (Plaque-induced) gingivitis—A common periodontal (gum) disease is Gingivitis. Periodontal refers to the area the infection affects, which include the teeth, gums, and tissues surrounding the teeth. Treatment of gingivitis is dependent on how severe and how far the disease has progressed. The condition involves the release of pyrogenic and erythrogenic endotoxins from the immune system. It starts as tonsilitis and pharyngitis before involving the soft palate and the tongue. If not treated, late stages of this condition may include a furred, raw, red tongue. Viral\n Herpes simplex (infection with herpes simplex virus, or HSV) is very common in the mouth and lips. Mumps of the salivary glands is a viral infection of the parotid glands. There is no specific treatment for mumps except for hydration and painkillers with complete recovery ranging from 5–10 days. Sometimes mumps can cause inflammation of the brain, pancreatitis, testicular swelling or hearing loss. Individuals who have undergone a transplant, HIV, cancer or use corticosteroids commonly develop candida of the mouth and oral cavity. Other risk factors are dentures and tongue piercing. Autoimmune\n Sjögren syndrome\n\nMetabolic\n\nInflammatory\n Angioedema\n\nNeurological\n\nNeoplastic\n\n Oral cancer may occur on the lips, tongue, gums, floor of the mouth or inside the cheeks. The majority of cancers of the mouth are squamous cell carcinoma. Oral cancers are usually painless in the initial stages or may appear like an ulcer. If you have a suspicious mass or ulcer on the mouth which has been persistent, then you should always get a dentist to look at it. Degenerative\n\nEnvironmental\n\nUnknown\nThere are many oral and maxillofacial pathologies which are not fully understood. Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a disorder where there is a burning sensation in the mouth that has no identifiable medical or dental cause. BMS has been hypothesized to be linked to a variety of factors such as the menopause, dry mouth (xerostomia) and allergies. Aphthous stomatitis is a condition where ulcers (canker sores) appear on the inside of the mouth, lips and on tongue. Unlike herpes sores, canker sores are always found inside the mouth and are usually less painful. Good oral hygiene does help but sometime one may have to use a topical corticosteroid. Migratory stomatitis is a condition that involves the tongue and other oral mucosa. When other oral mucosa, beside the dorsal and lateral tongue, are involved, the term migratory stomatitis (or ectopic geographic tongue) is preferred. In this condition, lesions infrequently involve also the ventral tongue and buccal or labial mucosa. They are rarely reported on the soft palate and floor of the mouth. Oral pathology is a closely allied speciality with oral and maxillofacial surgery and oral medicine. The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of oral mucosal diseases are in the scope of oral & maxillofacial pathology specialists and oral medicine practitioners, both disciplines of dentistry.

Diagnosis \nThe key to any diagnosis is thorough medical, dental, social and psychological history as well as assessing certain lifestyle risk factors that may be involved in disease processes. This is followed by a thorough clinical investigation including extra-oral and intra-oral hard and soft tissues. It is sometimes the case that a diagnosis and treatment regime are possible to determine from history and examination, however it is good practice to compile a list of differential diagnoses. There are many types of investigations in diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial diseases, including screening tests, imaging (radiographs, CBCT, CT, MRI, ultrasound) and histopathology (biopsy). Biopsy \nA biopsy is indicated when the patient's clinical presentation, past history or imaging studies do not allow a definitive diagnosis. Examples of the most common tissues examined by means of a biopsy include oral and sinus mucosa, bone, soft tissue, skin and lymph nodes. This method is preferred, if the lesions are approximately 1 cm or less in diameter, clinically and seemingly benign and surgically accessible. If the tumour is deeper inside the mouth or throat, the biopsy may need to be performed in an operating room. Diseases\nOral and maxillofacial pathology can involve many different types of tissues of the head. A great many diseases involve the mouth, jaws and orofacial skin. The following list is a general outline of pathologies that can affect oral and maxillofacial region; some are more common than others. The most common form is combined cleft lip and palate and it accounts for approximately 50% of the cases whereas isolated cleft lip concerns 20% of the patients. One of the major goals in the treatment of patients with cleft is to enhance social acceptance by surgical reconstruction.

The oculomotor nerve also innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which lifts the upper eyelid, and the sphincter pupillae muscle, which constricts the pupil. Therefore, oculomotor nerve palsy can also cause drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis) due to the disruption of these muscles' function. Reference: Oculomotor nerve palsy or oculomotor neuropathy is an eye condition resulting from damage to the third cranial nerve or a branch thereof. The limitations of eye movement resulting from the condition are generally so severe that patients are often unable to maintain normal eye alignment when gazing straight ahead, leading to strabismus and, as a consequence, double vision (diplopia). It enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and innervates extraocular muscles that enable most movements of the eye and that raise the eyelid. The nerve also contains fibers that innervate the intrinsic eye muscles that enable pupillary constriction and accommodation (ability to focus on near objects as in reading). The fibers from the two third nerve nuclei located laterally on either side of the cerebral aqueduct then pass through the red nucleus. From the red nucleus fibers then pass via the substantia nigra exiting through the interpeduncular fossa. On emerging from the brainstem, the nerve is invested with a sheath of pia mater, and enclosed in a prolongation from the arachnoid. It passes between the superior cerebellar (below) and posterior cerebral arteries (above), and then pierces the dura mater anterior and lateral to the posterior clinoid process, passing between the free and attached borders of the tentorium cerebelli. It traverses the cavernous sinus, above the other orbital nerves receiving in its course one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic nervous system, and a communicating branch from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. As the oculomotor nerve enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure it then divides into a superior and an inferior branch. The nerve also includes axons of type GVE, general visceral efferent, which provide preganglionic parasympathetics to the ciliary ganglion. From the ciliary ganglion post ganglionic fibers pass through the short ciliary nerve to the constrictor pupillae of the iris and the cilliary muscles. Clinical significance\n\nDisease\nParalysis of the oculomotor nerve, i.e., oculomotor nerve palsy, can arise due to:\ndirect trauma,\ndemyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis),\nincreased intracranial pressure (leading to uncal herniation)\ndue to a space-occupying lesion (e.g., brain cancer) or a\nspontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (e.g., berry aneurysm), and\nmicrovascular disease, e.g., diabetes. In people with diabetes and older than 50 years of age, an oculomotor nerve palsy, in the classical sense, occurs with sparing (or preservation) of the pupillary reflex. On the converse, an aneurysm which leads to compression of the oculomotor nerve affects the superficial fibers and manifests as a third nerve palsy with loss of the pupillary reflex (in fact, this third nerve finding is considered to represent an aneurysm—until proven otherwise—and should be investigated). Examination\n\nEye muscles\nCranial nerves III, IV, and VI are usually tested together as part of the cranial nerve examination. By observing the eye movement and eyelids, the examiner is able to obtain more information about the extraocular muscles, the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, and cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Loss of function of any of the eye muscles results in ophthalmoparesis. Damage to this nerve, termed oculomotor nerve palsy, is known by its down and out symptoms, because of the position of the affected eye (lateral, downward deviation of gaze).

It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived. This joint is unique in that it is a bilateral joint that functions as one unit. Since the TMJ is connected to the mandible, the right and left joints must function together and therefore are not independent of each other. Structure \nThe main components are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle. Articular disc\n\nThe unique feature of the temporomandibular joint is the articular disc. The temporomandibular joints are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The central area of the disc is avascular and lacks innervation, thus getting its nutrients from the surrounding synovial fluid. In contrast, the posterior ligament and the surrounding capsules along have both blood vessels and nerves. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo the addition of cartilage in the central part, changes that may lead to impaired movement of the joint. The synovial membrane covers the inner surface of the articular capsule in the TMJ, except for the surface of the articular disc and condylar cartilage. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone. Ligaments\nThere are three ligaments associated with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function. The base of this triangular ligament is attached to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. Other ligaments, called \"oto-mandibular ligaments\", connect the middle ear (malleus) with the temporomandibular joint:\n discomallear (or disco-malleolar) ligament,\n malleomandibular (or malleolar-mandibular) ligament. Nerve supply\nSensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is derived from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. The specific mechanics of proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors. Pacinian corpuscles are dynamic mechanoreceptors that accelerate movement during reflexes. Golgi tendon organs function as static mechanoreceptors for the protection of ligaments around the temporomandibular joint. The fibrocartilage that overlays the TMJ condyle is not innervated and is avascular in healthy TMJs. When bone tissue, ligaments, or muscles become inflamed or injured, sensory signals are relayed along small-diameter primary afferent nerve fibers that form the trigeminal nerve. Signals are directed through the trigeminal nerve and modulated by neuronal cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint. Development\nFormation of the temporomandibular joints occurs at around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the component of the fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Very little is known about the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. Function \n\nEach temporomandibular joint is classed as a \"ginglymoarthrodial\" joint since it is both a ginglymus (hinging joint) and an arthrodial (sliding) joint. At this point, if the mouth continues to open, not only are the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) translates. This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies in the vicinity of the mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible. The resting position of the temporomandibular joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and proprioceptive feedback allow a physiologic rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance, or freeway space, which is 2 to 4 mm between the teeth. For example, if the measurement from the edge of the lower front teeth to the edge of the upper front teeth is 40 millimeters and the overbite is 3 millimeters, then the jaw opening is 43 millimeters. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles. When the mandible is moved into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle on the side of the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side condyle performs the translation. The mandible is moved primarily by the four muscles of mastication: the masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid and the temporalis. Clinical significance\n\nPain\n\nTemporomandibular joint pain is generally due to one of four reasons. Temporal arteritis, for which it is considered a reliable diagnostic criteria\n\nPain or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is sometimes referred to as temporomandibular joint dysfunction or temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). This term is used to refer to a group of problems involving the temporomandibular joints and the muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and other tissues associated with them. These conditions include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor, and aneurysmal bone cyst. Examination\nThe temporomandibular joints can be felt in front of or within the external acoustic meatus during movements of the mandible. Disc displacement\nThe most common disorder of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement. In essence, this is when the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the condyle and the fossa so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on something other than the articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because, unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation. In most instances of disorder, the disc is displaced anteriorly upon translation, or the anterior and inferior sliding motion of the condyle forward within the fossa and down the articular eminence. On opening, a \"pop\" or \"click\" can sometimes be heard and usually felt also, indicating the condyle is moving back onto the disk, known as \"reducing the joint\" (disc displacement with reduction). Upon closing, the condyle will slide off the back of the disc, hence another \"click\" or \"pop\" at which point the condyle is posterior to the disc. In disc displacement without reduction the disc stays anterior to the condylar head upon opening.

        "context": "In anatomy, the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) are the two joints connecting the jawbone to the skull. It is a bilateral synovial articulation between the temporal bone of the skull above and the mandible below; it is from these bones that its name is derived. This joint is unique in that it is a bilateral joint that functions as one unit. Since the TMJ is connected to the mandible, the right and left joints must function together and therefore are not independent of each other. Structure \nThe main components are the joint capsule, articular disc, mandibular condyles, articular surface of the temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle. Articular disc\n\nThe unique feature of the temporomandibular joint is the articular disc. The temporomandibular joints are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The central area of the disc is avascular and lacks innervation, thus getting its nutrients from the surrounding synovial fluid. In contrast, the posterior ligament and the surrounding capsules along have both blood vessels and nerves. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo the addition of cartilage in the central part, changes that may lead to impaired movement of the joint. The synovial membrane covers the inner surface of the articular capsule in the TMJ, except for the surface of the articular disc and condylar cartilage. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. Unlike the disc itself, this piece of connective tissue is vascular and innervated, and in some cases of anterior disc displacement, the pain felt during movement of the mandible is due to the condyle compressing this area against the articular surface of the temporal bone. Ligaments\nThere are three ligaments associated with the temporomandibular joints: one major and two minor ligaments. Movements of the mandible made past the extents functionally allowed by the muscular attachments will result in painful stimuli, and thus, movements past these more limited borders are rarely achieved in normal function. The base of this triangular ligament is attached to the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the articular tubercle; its apex is fixed to the lateral side of the neck of the mandible. Other ligaments, called \"oto-mandibular ligaments\", connect the middle ear (malleus) with the temporomandibular joint:\n discomallear (or disco-malleolar) ligament,\n malleomandibular (or malleolar-mandibular) ligament. Nerve supply\nSensory innervation of the temporomandibular joint is derived from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. The specific mechanics of proprioception in the temporomandibular joint involve four receptors. Pacinian corpuscles are dynamic mechanoreceptors that accelerate movement during reflexes. Golgi tendon organs function as static mechanoreceptors for the protection of ligaments around the temporomandibular joint. The fibrocartilage that overlays the TMJ condyle is not innervated and is avascular in healthy TMJs. When bone tissue, ligaments, or muscles become inflamed or injured, sensory signals are relayed along small-diameter primary afferent nerve fibers that form the trigeminal nerve. Signals are directed through the trigeminal nerve and modulated by neuronal cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Other branches of the external carotid artery, namely the deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and maxillary artery, may also contribute to the arterial blood supply of the joint. Development\nFormation of the temporomandibular joints occurs at around 12 weeks in utero when the joint spaces and the articular disc develop. At approximately 10 weeks the component of the fetus future joint becomes evident in the mesenchyme between condylar cartilage of the mandible and the developing temporal bone. Very little is known about the significance of newly forming muscles in joint formation. This growth of the mandible also influences the overall shape of the face and thus is charted and referred to during orthodontic therapy. Function \n\nEach temporomandibular joint is classed as a \"ginglymoarthrodial\" joint since it is both a ginglymus (hinging joint) and an arthrodial (sliding) joint. At this point, if the mouth continues to open, not only are the condylar heads rotating within the lower compartment of the temporomandibular joints, but the entire apparatus (condylar head and articular disc) translates. This effectively produces an evolute which can be termed the resultant axis of mandibular rotation, which lies in the vicinity of the mandibular foramen, allowing for a low-tension environment for the vasculature and innervation of the mandible. The resting position of the temporomandibular joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and proprioceptive feedback allow a physiologic rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance, or freeway space, which is 2 to 4 mm between the teeth. For example, if the measurement from the edge of the lower front teeth to the edge of the upper front teeth is 40 millimeters and the overbite is 3 millimeters, then the jaw opening is 43 millimeters. The latter terms, although a bit outdated, are actually more precise, as they define the sides by the movements of the respective condyles. When the mandible is moved into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle on the side of the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side condyle performs the translation. The mandible is moved primarily by the four muscles of mastication: the masseter, medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid and the temporalis. Clinical significance\n\nPain\n\nTemporomandibular joint pain is generally due to one of four reasons. Temporal arteritis, for which it is considered a reliable diagnostic criteria\n\nPain or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is sometimes referred to as temporomandibular joint dysfunction or temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). This term is used to refer to a group of problems involving the temporomandibular joints and the muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and other tissues associated with them. These conditions include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, giant cell tumor, and aneurysmal bone cyst. Examination\nThe temporomandibular joints can be felt in front of or within the external acoustic meatus during movements of the mandible. Disc displacement\nThe most common disorder of a temporomandibular joint is disc displacement. In essence, this is when the articular disc, attached anteriorly to the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle and posteriorly to the retrodiscal tissue, moves out from between the condyle and the fossa so that the mandible and temporal bone contact is made on something other than the articular disc. This, as explained above, is usually very painful, because, unlike these adjacent tissues, the central portion of the disc contains no sensory innervation. In most instances of disorder, the disc is displaced anteriorly upon translation, or the anterior and inferior sliding motion of the condyle forward within the fossa and down the articular eminence. On opening, a \"pop\" or \"click\" can sometimes be heard and usually felt also, indicating the condyle is moving back onto the disk, known as \"reducing the joint\" (disc displacement with reduction). Upon closing, the condyle will slide off the back of the disc, hence another \"click\" or \"pop\" at which point the condyle is posterior to the disc.
