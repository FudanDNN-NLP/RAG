He refuses to attribute the accusation of simplifying complex issues to populists alone; rather, all parties would engage in this. The modern type of protest voter does not choose a political preference, but expresses his discomfort with established politics, by which he no longer feels taken seriously. With regard to the US presidential candidate Donald Trump or the Freedom Party of Austria candidate Norbert Hofer for President of Austria, Liessmann said that one could not gather completely different phenomena under the inflationarily used term \"right-wing populism\". Populist Congressman Tom Watson of Georgia is often cited as the main example of the initial racial liberalism of Southern Populism, acknowledging blacks as an integral part of Southern economy and society. Commenting on populism in Latin America, Paul Drake described what he called ‘bait-and-switch’ strategies, in which candidates engage in a redistributive discourse in order to attract the support of the poor, only later to apply neoliberal structural adjustment policies. It is possible that these ‘bait-and-switchers,’ as Drake called them, would actually prefer to implement their favored redistributive policies, but were forced by constraints deriving from market imperatives to implement orthodox policies. Kenneth Roberts proposed the bait-and-switch argument as one of the core characteristics of a new kind of Latin American populism (broad-based and supported by the lower classes, but implementing market-driven policies) of \n\n the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to \"angry old white men\" who would soon be demographically displaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed.\n\n"
