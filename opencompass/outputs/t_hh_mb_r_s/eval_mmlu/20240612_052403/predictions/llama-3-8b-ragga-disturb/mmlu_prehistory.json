Lidar has been successful in identifying permanent structures built by large-scale complex agriculturalist societies. The Wheeler–Kenyon method is a method of archaeological excavation. The technique originates from the work of Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Wheeler at Verulamium (1930–35), and was later refined by Kathleen Kenyon during her excavations at Jericho (1952–58). These vertical slices of earth allow archaeologists to compare the exact provenance of a found object or feature to adjacent layers of earth (\"strata\"). It was believed that this approach allowed more precise stratigraphic observations than earlier \"horizontal exposure\" techniques that relied on architectural and ceramic analysis. The archaeological study of modern ruins is most commonly associated with contemporary, urban, and industrial archaeology. The processes and goals involved in the archaeological study of modern ruins are very similar to that of other branches of archaeology that primarily focus on studying sites of earlier time periods. Particular field methods used include meticulous surveying, excavation, and record keeping, all of which are generally similar to archaeology concerning older, buried sites. However, it has been argued that the archaeological approach to modern ruins should be more embodied and visually well rounded, rather than simply communicating information by conventional site descriptions and reports. Photography, for example, is often used as a medium to communicate discoveries made in modern ruins \n\nThe methods used to determine the impacts of land use and land cover change on soil properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin in China involved several steps. This allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the extent and nature of land use changes in the study area. Physical and chemical experiments were conducted to determine various soil properties, including soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total potassium, total phosphorous, available nitrogen, available potassium, and available phosphorous. The Independent-Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test, which is a non-parametric test, was used to compare the differences in soil properties among different land use/land cover categories. In summary, the methods used in this study involved mapping LUCC using remote sensing and GIS techniques, collecting soil and vegetation samples, conducting physical and chemical experiments, and employing statistical analyses to evaluate the effects of LUCC on soil properties in the riparian zones of the middle Heihe River basin in China. Oxford Archaeology has incorporated digital survey techniques into its geomatics work. The most notable of these techniques is photogrammetric mapping, which uses photographs taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to create accurate three-dimensional models of the archaeological evidence, including artefacts, historic buildings or whole landscapes.
