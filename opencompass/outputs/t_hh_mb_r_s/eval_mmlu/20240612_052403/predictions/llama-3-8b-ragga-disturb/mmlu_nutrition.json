While genetics can predispose individuals to obesity, they cannot fully explain the significant rise in obesity rates seen worldwide. One factor that has contributed to the increase in obesity rates is changes in dietary patterns. The availability and affordability of high-calorie, processed foods have increased, leading to a higher consumption of unhealthy food choices. This shift towards a more calorie-dense diet, coupled with larger portion sizes and increased snacking, has contributed to excess calorie intake. Additionally, urbanization and changes in transportation patterns have played a role in the global increase in obesity rates. The complex interplay between genetic factors, environmental influences, cultural norms, socioeconomic status, and individual behaviors all contribute to the global rise in obesity rates. Overall, while genetic influences play a role in obesity, it is clear that shifts in dietary patterns towards high-calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization, and changes in transportation patterns are major contributors to the global increase in obesity rates. Many studies have been conducted to provide insight into whether genetics are to blame, or economic and environmental circumstances.

Socioeconomic Factors: Poverty and income inequality play a role in obesity rates.

Atrophic gastritis is a condition where the stomach lining becomes thin and inflamed, leading to a decrease in intrinsic factor production. Small bowel resection involves surgical removal of a portion of the small intestine, which can result in reduced absorption of vitamin B12. These conditions interfere with the normal process of absorbing vitamin B12 from food sources, leading to a deficiency if not properly addressed. Reference:\n- Pernicious anemia (also called Addison's anemia) is a type of red blood cell disorder caused by impaired vitamin B12 metabolism. Vitamin B12 is primarily absorbed by the small intestine, after being bound to intrinsic factor secreted by parietal cells of gastric mucosa. When this process is disrupted by conditions like atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, small bowel resection etc., B12 deficiency ensues. The most common are vitamin B12 deficiency which results in a megaloblastic anemia and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. Those with the autoimmune version of atrophic gastritis are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria. Type A gastritis primarily affects the body/fundus of the stomach and is more common with pernicious anemia.Type B gastritis primarily affects the antrum, and is more common with H. pylori infection. That said, symptomatic patients are mostly females and signs of atrophic gastritis are those associated with iron deficiency: fatigue, restless legs syndrome, brittle nails, hair loss, impaired immune function, and impaired wound healing. Although, atrophic gastritis impairs iron and vitamin B12 absorption, iron deficiency will be found at a younger age and many years before the development of pernicious anemia. Environmental metaplastic atrophic gastritis (EMAG) is due to environmental factors, such as diet and H. pylori infection. The inadequate production of intrinsic factor also leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption and pernicious anemia.

Increased adiposity also increases aromatase activity, leading to increased levels of bioavailable oestrogen levels in postmenopausal women. 18.2\n\nEffect of obesity on hormones and endometrial cancer. Obesity can increase risk of endometrial cancer through several parallel endocrine pathways\n\nAmong premenopausal women, the lack of progesterone, because of ovarian androgen production and continuous anovulation, leads to reduced production of IGFBP-1 by the endometrium. After menopause (and in the absence of exogenous oestrogen production), when ovarian progesterone synthesis has ceased altogether, the more central risk factor seems to be obesity-related increases in bioavailable oestrogen levels.### Inflammation\n\nThe association between chronic inflammation and cancer is well established (Coussens and Werb 2002) as is the link between obesity and inflammation (Hursting et al.2003).\n\n"
