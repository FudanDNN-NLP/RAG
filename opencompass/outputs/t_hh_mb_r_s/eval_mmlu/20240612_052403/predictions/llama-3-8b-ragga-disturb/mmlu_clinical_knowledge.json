IV cannulas are medical devices used to establish access to a patient's veins for various purposes, such as medication administration or blood sample collection. The size of an IV cannula is denoted by the gauge, or G, which indicates the diameter of the needle. It is important to note that healthcare professionals carefully select the appropriate size of IV cannula based on factors such as the patient's condition, the purpose of the procedure, and the vein accessibility. If you have any specific concerns or further questions about IV cannulas or their sizes, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation. When it comes to managing massive bleeding during surgery, it is important to choose the appropriate sized cannula. One commonly recommended size is a 16 gauge cannula. Using a larger gauge cannula can help ensure sufficient blood flow and prevent further complications. However, the specific size of the cannula may vary based on the surgical procedure and the patient's condition. It is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or an anesthesiologist who can assess the situation and make an informed decision regarding the appropriate cannula size for the surgery. This method can be preferred on the elderly, those with cancer, severe burns, obesity, or where the veins are unreliable or fragile. Another alternative is drawing blood from indwelling cannulae. In the case of a patient with severe dehydration, the preferred intravenous (IV) line may depend on several factors such as the patient's condition, medical history, and the overall treatment plan. This is because a large-bore IV line allows for rapid infusion of fluids, which is crucial in addressing severe dehydration. For example, a thin-walled 24-gauge Insyte (BD Medical) catheter has about the same flow-rate ability as a 22-gauge non–thin-walled Angiocath (BD Medical).

The indications for this procedure include: Use of the Hartmann's procedure initially had a mortality rate of 8.8%. Currently, the overall mortality rate is lower but varies greatly depending on indication for surgery. One study showed no statistically significant difference in morbidity or mortality between laparoscopic versus open Hartmann procedure. Intestinal waste passes out of the ileostomy and is collected in an external ostomy system which is placed next to the opening. Uses\nIleostomies are necessary where injury or a surgical response to disease has meant the large intestine cannot safely process waste, typically because the colon and rectum have been partially or wholly removed. One example is a situation where the cancer tumor is causing a blockage (obstruction). Permanent ileostomies are usually done this way. Duration \nIn a temporary or loop ileostomy, a loop of the ileum is surgically brought through the skin creating a stoma, but keeping the lower portion of the ileum for future reattachment in cases where the entire colon and rectum are not removed but need time to heal. Temporary ileostomies are also often made as the first stage in surgical construction of an ileo-anal pouch, so fecal material doesn't enter the newly made pouch until it heals and has been tested for leaks—usually requiring a period of eight to ten weeks. When healing is complete the temporary ileostomy is then \"taken down\" (or reversed) by surgically repairing the loop of intestine which made the temporary stoma and closing the skin incision. Living with an ileostomy\n\nPeople with ileostomies must use an ostomy pouch to collect intestinal waste. People with ileostomies typically use an open-ended (referred to as a \"drainable\") one- or two-piece pouch that is secured at the lower end with a leakproof clip, or velcro fastener. Ordinarily, the pouch must be emptied several times a day. Ostomy pouches fit close to the body and are usually not visible under regular clothing unless the pouch becomes too full. The stomal- or colorectal-nurse does this initially for a patient and advises them on the exact size required for the pouch's opening. If the output contains blood, an ileostomate (patient) is advised to visit an emergency department. Other options\nIn some patients with Crohn's disease, a procedure called an ileoanal anastomosis is done if the disease affects the entire colon and rectum, but leaves the anus unaffected. This procedure requires a temporary loop ileostomy to allow the anastomosis to heal. The formation of this pouch (made possible through a procedure first pioneered by Dr. Nils Kock in 1969), involves the creation of an internal reservoir which is formed using the ileum and connecting it through the abdominal wall in a very similar fashion to a standard \"Brooke\" ileostomy. The BCIR procedure should not be confused with a J-pouch, which is also an ileal reservoir, but is connected directly to the anus—after removal of the colon and rectum—avoiding the need for subsequent use of external appliances. Barnett continent intestinal reservoir \n\nThe Barnett continent intestinal reservoir (BCIR) is a type of an appliance-free intestinal ostomy. It is a surgically created pouch, or reservoir, on the inside of the abdomen, made from the last part of the small intestine (the ileum), and is used for the storage of intestinal waste. The pouch is internal, so the BCIR does not require wearing an appliance or ostomy bag. How it works\nThe pouch works by storing the liquid waste, which is drained several times a day using a small silicone tube called a catheter. The capacity of the internal pouch increases steadily after surgery: from 50ccs, when first constructed, to 600–1000ccs (about one quart) over a period of months, when the pouch fully matures. The opening through which the catheter is introduced into the pouch is called the stoma. The BCIR requires no external appliance and it can be drained whenever it is convenient. The process of draining the pouch is simple and quickly mastered. By the early 1970s, several major medical centers in the United States were performing Kock pouch ileostomies on patients with ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. One problem with these early Kock pouches was valve slippage, which often resulted in difficulty intubating and an incontinent pouch. This further stabilized and supported the valve, decreasing valve slippage. These modifications included reconfiguring the pouch to decrease the number of suture lines from three to one (this allowed the pouch to heal faster and reduced the chance of developing fistulae); and creating a serosal patch over the suture lines which prevented leakage. Candidates for BCIR include: people who are dissatisfied with the results of an alternate procedure (whether a conventional Brooke ileostomy or another procedure); patients with a malfunctioning/failed Kock pouch or IPAA/J-pouch; and individuals with poor internal/external anal sphincter control who either elect not to have the J-pouch (IPAA) or are not a good candidate for IPAA. There are, however, some contraindications for having the BCIR surgery. BCIR is not for people who have or need a colostomy, people with [active] Crohn's disease, mesenteric desmoids, obesity, advanced age, or poor motivation. All patients were between 1–5 years post-op with an admitting diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis. The study found that:\n Approximately 92% of the patients have functional BCIR pouches at least one year after surgery;\n 87.2% of patients required no or minor subsequent surgery to ensure a functioning pouch;\n 6.5% of patients required subsequent excision (removal) of the pouch (with the majority of these having occurred within the first year (63.6%);\n Re-operation rate for major pouch-related complications (other than pouch removal) was 12.8% (including: slipped valve (6.3%), valve fistulas (4.5%), and pouch fistulas (6.3%));\n Of the 32 patients treated for valve slippage, 23 achieved a fully functioning pouch. Pouch or valve fistulas affected 52 patients, 39 ultimately achieved successful results. Pouch leaks occurred in 11 patients, of these 7 have functioning pouches. Complications not related to the pouch itself parallel those that accompany other abdominal surgeries; with the most frequent being small bowel obstruction (which occurred in 50 patients, 20 of whom required surgical intervention);\n \"Several questions were administered to patients whose responses revealed a significant improvement in general quality of life, state of mind, and overall health; Over 87% of the patients in this study feel their quality of life is better after having the BCIR. ASCRS special study, 1999\nIn 1999 American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons published a unique study on 42 patients with a failed IPAA/J-pouch who converted to the Barnett modification of the Kock pouch (BCIR).

It may result in horizontal diplopia or double vision, where the patient sees two images side by side. This is because the misalignment of the eyes causes each eye to receive a different visual input. Furthermore, if there is a third cranial nerve palsy, the function of the fourth cranial nerve can be evaluated. In this case, the eye affected by the fourth nerve palsy may intort or rotate inward on attempted downward gaze. Double vision from an isolated fourth nerve palsy is typically worse with ipsilateral head tilt. A compensatory head tilt to the opposite shoulder, known as Bielschowsky sign, is a characteristic feature of fourth-nerve lesions. This maneuver causes intorsion of the unaffected eye and helps alleviate the double vision. In this scenario, the patient may tilt their head toward the side of the lesion to ameliorate the diplopia. Bilateral trochlear palsies, often seen after head trauma, can present with alternating hyperdeviation depending on the direction of gaze. In summary, lesions affecting the sixth nerve can lead to lateral gaze palsy, while lesions of the superior oblique muscle and trochlear nucleus can result in downward gaze palsy. These conditions can cause symptoms such as diplopia (double vision) and specific eye deviations. Paralysis of the superior oblique muscle results in weakness of downward movement of the affected eye, and the upward deviation of the eye increases as it adducts on attempted horizontal gaze. Diplopia and cranial palsy are complex conditions resulting in vision dysfunctions such as double vision (diplopia). Diplopia and cranial palsy comprise one of the most sweeping differential diagnoses in all of ophthalmology eye care. Diplopia occurs when the eyes are not moving together so that the brain is getting two slightly different pictures simultaneously. Rarely, MS patients may develop double vision from a sixth nerve palsy or other neuro-ophthalmologic disorder. Sometimes the patient does not see two completely separate images. An important question to ask is whether the visual problem goes away if either eye is closed. Because diplopia is caused by the brain receiving two different images, one from each eye, as soon as eithereye is closed, this type of visual problem will go away. On examination, there may be an obvious problem with the movement of the eyes, but sometimes the misalignment is not easy to see without special equipment. This occurs when the images produced by the two eyes do not absolutely match, so that the images produced are misaligned relative to one another. The diplopia disappears when one eye is covered. It affects one eye only and continues when the unaffected eye is covered. Abducens (also called sixth) nerve palsy is the most common in MS and affects the nerve which operates lateral rectus muscle which pulls the eye outwards. Oculomotor (also called third) nerve palsy is much rarer than abducnes in MS and it’s not really understood why. Forth nerve palsy is often associated with vertical diplopia. Lesions to these areas will often show up in MRI scans and your neuro can often pinpoint the actual lesion that is causing the problem on the image. A related paralysis, called internuclear ophthalmoplegia, sometimes, but not always, leads to double vision. It is due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle, which is also commonly affected by MS.\nDiplopia often resolves on its own in six to 8 weeks time. The eye patch is guaranteed to “cure” the diplopia, since only one eye will be sending an image to the brain, but some patients may feel self-conscious while wearing the patch. Prism eyeglasses are similar to prescription eyeglasses for reading. In rare cases, strabismus surgery (surgery to correct crossed eye) may be recommended to realign the eyes. For some people, wearing a patch over one eye or frosted tape over one lens of their glasses helps block visual input from one eye, thereby achieving single vision until the exacerbation is over. There is no danger in developing a “lazy eye” from patching. If patching is not effective, prism lenses may be incorporated into eyeglasses to redirect the way light enters the eye. Over time, the eye muscles learn to fuse the images into one. When patching and prisms don’t work, doctors may prescribe steroids. To initially relieve double vision (diplopia) caused by an extra-ocular muscle palsy, an eye care professional may recommend using an eyepatch. What is a fourth nerve palsy? The fourth cranial nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, so weakness of the nerve is also known as superior oblique palsy. Palsy refers to a complete weakness of a muscle while a paresis is a partial weakness. During that period, diplopia can be managed with prism glasses. If the palsy does not recover over this 6 month period and if prisms are not able to adequately control the diplopia, surgery may be indicated. A complete third nerve palsy refers to the complete paralysis of the third cranial nerve, which has multiple effects on the eye and surrounding structures. This type of palsy is characterized by several clinical effects, including ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), an inability to rotate the eye upward, downward, or inward, diplopia (double vision), dilated and nonreactive pupil (iridoplegia), and paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) due to the interruption of parasympathetic fibers in the third nerve. This is often described as the eye being \"down and out.\" The diplopia experienced by the patient occurs when the image from the affected eye is projected upward and medially. While a complete third nerve palsy typically involves impairments in both the extrinsic and intrinsic (pupillary) eye muscles, certain diseases can affect them separately. In some cases, the pupil may be spared despite the paralysis of other eye muscles, especially if the lesion affects the central portion of the oculomotor nerve. As a result, the pupil may constrict when the eye is turned up and in, even though it is unreactive to light. It's important to note that a complete third nerve palsy can have various underlying causes, with a lesion of the fourth nerve being the most common cause of isolated symptomatic vertical diplopia. Overall, the clinical effects of a complete third nerve palsy impact multiple aspects of eye movement and function, resulting in characteristic symptoms and signs that can be observed during physical examination.

In lower motor neuron lesions, the loss of lower motor neurons leads to several changes in muscle function. Furthermore, deep tendon reflexes are decreased in lower motor neuron lesions, a condition known as hyporeflexia. In contrast, upper motor neuron lesions present with different clinical deficits. In the early stages of upper motor neuron lesions, the muscles initially display hypotonia and hyporeflexia, similar to lower motor neuron lesions. However, over time, the muscles affected by upper motor neuron lesions develop increased tone (hypertonia) and deep tendon reflexes become exaggerated (hyperreflexia), a condition known as spasticity. One specific marker of an upper motor neuron lesion is the presence of the Babinski sign. It's worth noting that in a normal child who has not yet begun walking, a positive Babinski sign can be observed since the upper motor neurons have not yet functionally modified lower motor neuron activity. To summarize, the clinical deficits observed after an upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron lesion differ in terms of muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes. Lower motor neuron lesions are characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, hypotonia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. In contrast, upper motor neuron lesions present with muscle weakness, hypertonia, increased deep tendon reflexes, and the development of spasticity. The presence of the Babinski sign can also be indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. The main attributes of upper motor neuron lesions can be distinguished from lower motor neuron lesions based on specific characteristics. Upper motor neuron lesions typically result in spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and clonus, while lower motor neuron lesions are associated with weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. Another characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions is hyperreflexia, which refers to an exaggerated response of deep tendon reflexes. The presence of the Babinski sign is also indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. In individuals with upper motor neuron lesions, this reflex is abnormal, with the toes extending rather than flexing. Clonus is another notable feature of upper motor neuron lesions. On the other hand, lower motor neuron lesions primarily manifest as weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. In summary, the main attributes of upper motor neuron lesions include spasticity, hyperreflexia, the Babinski sign, and clonus. In contrast, lower motor neuron lesions are characterized by weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. Understanding these distinctions can aid in diagnosing and differentiating between various neurological conditions affecting the motor system. Exploratory movements and manipulation of small objects are impaired, and the speed of tapping is diminished. There can be lower motor neuron findings (e.g. Motor neuron diseases are seen both in children and in adults. Upper motor neuron paralysis refers to an injury or lesion that occurs in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in damage to the upper motor neurons. On the other hand, lower motor neuron paralysis refers to damage or injury to the lower motor neurons that are located in the spinal cord or brainstem and connect to the muscles directly. The main difference between upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis lies in the location of the damage or injury. Upper motor neuron paralysis occurs when there is damage to the upper motor neurons in the brain or spinal cord, while lower motor neuron paralysis occurs when there is damage to the lower motor neurons located in the spinal cord or brainstem. In terms of clinical presentation, upper motor neuron paralysis often leads to certain characteristic signs, such as spasticity (increased muscle tone), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), and a loss of voluntary movements. Additionally, muscle weakness, though present, may not be as severe as in lower motor neuron paralysis. Lower motor neuron paralysis, on the other hand, often presents with muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), reduced or absent reflexes (hyporeflexia or areflexia), and muscle wasting. Both upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis can result in significant motor impairment and loss of function. When testing arm abduction, there are specific signs that can indicate upper motor neuron lesions and lower motor neuron lesions. Upper motor neuron lesions typically present with spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski's sign. Both types of lesions result in weakness. During testing, look for signs of spasticity (indicative of upper motor neuron lesions) such as stiffness or increased resistance during movement. Additionally, watch out for signs of lower motor neuron lesions, including atrophy (muscle wasting), fasciculations (twitching of muscle fibers), decreased muscle tone, and reduced reflex responses.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about clinical knowledge.

In terms of clinical presentation, upper motor neuron paralysis often leads to certain characteristic signs, such as spasticity (increased muscle tone), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), and a loss of voluntary movements. Additionally, muscle weakness, though present, may not be as severe as in lower motor neuron paralysis. Lower motor neuron paralysis, on the other hand, often presents with muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), reduced or absent reflexes (hyporeflexia or areflexia), and muscle wasting. Both upper motor neuron paralysis and lower motor neuron paralysis can result in significant motor impairment and loss of function. When testing arm abduction, there are specific signs that can indicate upper motor neuron lesions and lower motor neuron lesions. Upper motor neuron lesions typically present with spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski's sign. Both types of lesions result in weakness. During testing, look for signs of spasticity (indicative of upper motor neuron lesions) such as stiffness or increased resistance during movement. Additionally, watch out for signs of lower motor neuron lesions, including atrophy (muscle wasting), fasciculations (twitching of muscle fibers), decreased muscle tone, and reduced reflex responses.\n\n"
