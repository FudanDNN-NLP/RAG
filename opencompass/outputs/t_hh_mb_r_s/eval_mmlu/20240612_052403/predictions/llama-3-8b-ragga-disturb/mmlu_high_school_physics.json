They are made with capacitance values from 0.1 µF up to 2,700,000 µF (2.7 F), and rated voltages values from 4 V up to 630 V. The liquid electrolyte provides oxygen for re-forming or self-healing of the dielectric oxide layer. However, it can evaporate through a temperature-dependent drying-out process, which causes electrical parameters to drift, limiting the service life time of the capacitors. Due to their relatively high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like mains frequency. The value at a measuring frequency of 1 kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120 Hz value. The DC capacitance is about 10% higher than the 100/120 Hz \n\n  Charging a capacitor (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field to be applied to the dielectric between the electrodes. When the capacitor is discharging, the strength of the electric field is decreasing and the common orientation of the molecular dipoles \n\n equation (C = ), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to the distance between them for a parallel-plate capacitor. As the capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor does change very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is sensibly constant.\n\n"
