It is the sacrifice related to the second best choice available to someone, or group, who has picked among several mutually exclusive choices. Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream economics and has been described as expressing \"the basic relationship between scarcity and choice\". The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that resources are used efficiently. It has the formula: Beginning Inventory (at the start of accounting period) + purchases (within the accounting period) + Production (within the accounting period) = cost of goods available for sale Notice that purchases and production might not be the same throughout the year, since purchase cost and production cost might vary. But at the end, the total cost of purchases and production are added to beginning inventory cost to give cost of goods available for sale.
