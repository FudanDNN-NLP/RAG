These qualities may have appealed to those who desired a non-traditional candidate but also raised concerns about his temperament and judgment. Political views are another important factor. This has garnered her support from those who share similar views but also faced criticism from conservatives. Citizens in Western democracies often hold negative attitudes towards political bodies, such as Congress, but still consistently vote for their own representatives within these political bodies. Studies have shown that when citizens are exposed to unrelated negative political information, their attitudes towards political categories, such as U.S. governors, decrease. However, this negative information has no effect on their attitudes towards familiar, individual politicians, such as their own governor. People tend to have a more positive perception of politicians they are familiar with, even if they hold negative views about the larger political body. Firstly, individuals often have better knowledge about their own representatives, including their track record, policy positions, and personal qualities. Voters may align themselves with a particular party or ideology, and their representatives serve as a means to promote those values within the political system. Thirdly, individuals may also perceive their own representatives as more accountable and accessible compared to the larger political body. It is important to note that this paradox is not limited to a specific region or political ideology. It has been observed across various regions in the United States and remains consistent regardless of political leaning. In summary, citizens in Western democracies may hold negative attitudes towards political bodies, but still consistently vote for their own representatives.
