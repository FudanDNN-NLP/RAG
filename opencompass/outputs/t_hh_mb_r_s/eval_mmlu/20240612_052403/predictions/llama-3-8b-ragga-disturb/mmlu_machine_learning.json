Term pair similarity evaluates non-contextual word embeddings (NCWEs) by measuring the similarity between pairs of terms. On the other hand, cloze task accuracy assesses contextual word embeddings (CWEs) by measuring how accurately the model can predict missing words in a given context. In a study titled \"Intrinsic Evaluation of Contextual and Non-contextual Word Embeddings using Radiology Reports,\" researchers developed these intrinsic evaluation tasks using a corpus of radiology reports. They compared embedding models trained on different corpora, such as a custom radiology report corpus, a general corpus, and PubMed and MIMIC-III corpora. The study found that for term pair similarity, embeddings trained on the PubMed and MIMIC-III corpora (P&MC) outperformed other non-contextual word embedding models (NCWEs). Cloze task accuracy, on the other hand, was equivalent for models trained on the custom radiology report corpus (RRC) and the P&MC corpora. Among the NCWE models trained on the RRC, fastText models often performed better than other models in the term pair similarity task. This suggests that P&MC-trained NCWEs and RRC-trained fastText models may be particularly effective for intrinsic evaluation based on clinician judgment.

If it has no hidden layers, then it can only learn linear problems. If it has one hidden layer, then it can learn any continuous function on compact subsets of Rn as shown by the Universal approximation theorem, thus it can have an arbitrary decision boundary. In particular, support vector machines find a hyperplane that separates the feature space into two classes with the maximum margin. If the problem is not originally linearly separable, the kernel trick can be used to turn it into a linearly separable one, by increasing the number of dimensions. Thus a general hypersurface in a small dimension space is turned into a hyperplane in a space with much larger dimensions. Neural networks try to learn the decision boundary which minimizes the empirical error, while support vector machines try to learn the decision boundary which maximizes the empirical margin between the decision boundary and data points. However, these algorithms often produce classifiers with weaknesses in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. This paper introduces fuzzy support vector machine which is a learning algorithm based on combination of fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines for microarray classification. Experimental results on public leukemia, prostate, and colon cancer datasets show that fuzzy support vector machine applied in combination with filter or wrapper feature selection methods develops a robust model with higher accuracy than the conventional microarray classification models such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Furthermore, the interpretable rule-base inferred from fuzzy support vector machine helps extracting biological knowledge from microarray data. Fuzzy support vector machine as a new classification model with high generalization power, robustness, and good interpretability seems to be a promising tool for gene expression microarray classification. Many machine learning algorithms are designed and applied for microarray classification problem which some of them provided fruitful results but due to the challenges of dealing with microarrays researchers are still working on designing more accurate, robust, and interpretable models for microarray classification. Furthermore, feature selection decreases the chance of overfitting and increases the chance of producing more understandable results. On the other hand, the multivariate filter methods like multiple hypothesis testing models [5, 6] consider the interconnection between features and are slower than univariate approaches. It is important to note that univariate filter methods are usually faster than the multivariate filter methods as they ignore interconnection of genes and the multivariate filter methods are usually faster than wrapper methods as they ignore interactions with the classifier, but wrapper methods and multivariate filter methods consider interconnection of genes and have the chance of finding the best subset that work together in determination of the class label of the given problem. Supervised learning is a process in which the class labels of a set of instances are given and by applying a learning method, we build a classifier which can be used later in determining the class label of new instances. Various classification models have been applied on microarrays like support vector machine (SVM) [11, 12], artificial neural network (ANN) , decision trees [10, 14], k nearest neighbors (KNN) , diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) . SVM in a binary classification problem finds maximum margin classifier among many different classifiers that can separate instances of two classes. The points that lie closest to this max-margin hyperplane are called the support vectors. The hyperplane can be defined using these points alone and the classifier only makes use of these support vectors to classify test samples. In the case that data points are not linearly separable in the input space, one solution is to map the input space into a higher dimensional feature space called kernel space . The reasons of its good performance are its ability in dealing with high dimensional problems, ability in dealing with noisy features, scalability, and its high generalization power. The internal nodes are associated with a splitting criterion which consists of a splitting attribute and one or more splitting predicates defined on this attribute. The leaf nodes are labelled with a single class label. In the first phase, the growing phase, an overgrown decision tree is built from the training data. The splitting criterion at each internal node is chosen to split the data sets into subsets that have better class separability, thus minimizing the misclassification error. They have many advantages that make them a suitable choice for microarray classification like scalability, fast setup, independence of input parameters, and generating rule-based models. Disadvantage of decision trees that appears in high dimensional problems like microarray classification is that they become overfitted easily [10, 14]. In KNN classifier, class label of an unseen instance is determined by a majority voting on the class label of its k nearest neighbors and correlation or Euclidean distance is usually used to calculate distance of two samples. The basic idea of LDA is to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space such that the data points are reshaped to maximize the class separability. The optimal projection of classical LDA is obtained by maximizing the between-class distance while minimizing the within-class distance . In high dimensional problems with few samples like the case of microarrays a great challenge to classical LDA is the singularity and instability of the within-group sum of squares matrix or the sample covariance matrix. Therefore, the covariance matrix will be singular if the total number of observations in the training data (N) is less than the number of features (P) or might be very unstable and noisy if N is not significantly larger than P. It has been shown that the performance of LDA in high-dimensional situations is far from optimal. But, as more features are added to a given model, the complexity of the model is increased and as a consequence the overfitting chance and the misclassification rate of new samples increases . To do so we apply an additive fuzzy system to kernel machines, and demonstrate that, under a general assumption on membership functions, an additive fuzzy rule-based classification system can be constructed directly from the given training samples using the support vector learning approach. Here, we explain the feature selection methods, the supervised learning method, and the model evaluation strategy used in this study. Here, we use a common filter feature selection technique (signal to noise ratio (SNR) ) and a common wrapper feature selection technique (support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE)) [20, 21]. SNR was used in the first reported study of application of machine learning in microarray classification domain conducted by Golub et al. In this formula, µi(+) and σi(+) respectively represent mean and standard deviation of positively labeled samples and µi(-) and σi(-) respectively represent mean and standard deviation of negatively labeled samples. The second step in microarray classification is taken in order to build a reliable model on training samples which can correctly predict class label of test samples. Here, we apply fuzzy support vector machine algorithm for supervised learning [22, 23]. This method has combined the good generalization performance and ability to work in high dimensional spaces of support vector machine algorithm with high interpretability of fuzzy rule based models. A model with these properties is expected to overcome the challenges of dealing with microarrays very well. One particular kind of kernel, Mercer kernel, has received considerable attention in the machine learning literature  because it is an efficient way of extending linear learning machines to nonlinear ones. Fuzzy support vector machine is a fuzzy rule-based model in which membership functions are reference functions with location transformation and given input x → determines output class label by equation (9) in which K ( x → , z J ⃗ ) is a Mercer kernel defined by equation (8). Steps of setting up fuzzy support vector machine classification model and rule extraction are as shown in Figure 1. In order to assess the performance of the proposed model and compare the accuracy of this classifier with the accuracy of the state-of-the-art classifiers, 10-fold cross validation strategy is used. The following is a brief introduction about these datasets, while more detailed information can be found from, respectively, the indicated data resources. In this section we review the four hypotheses that we defined to explore power of fuzzy support vector machine model in microarray studies. Hypothesis 1: how is the performance of fuzzy support vector machine model in comparison with the performance of common classification models used on microarrays like SVM, ANN, decision trees like CART, KNN, and DLDA? Experiment 1: we train all these classifiers on the original microarray datasets without doing any kind of feature selection and compare the accuracy of these models. Hypothesis 2: does fuzzy support vector machine model benefit from feature selection? Experiment 3: we first set up fuzzy support vector machine classifier without taking the feature selection step and then we set up fuzzy support vector machine classifier with taking the feature selection step by use of both SNR and SVM-RFE methods and then compare the accuracy of these models. Hypothesis 3: is the output rule-base generated by fuzzy support vector machine model useful for extracting meaningful information for biomedical researchers? Experiment 4: as an instance of the rule-base generated by fuzzy support vector machine, we first apply SNR feature selection method on leukemia dataset and select three genes and then we set up fuzzy support vector machine classifier on those genes. We explore some characteristics of the model by taking a deeper look at the rule-base. Hypothesis 4: is fuzzy support vector machine model a robust one for microarray classification? We have two parameters in fuzzy support vector machine classification model: (1) C which is the misclassification cost of support vector machine classifier and (2) the number of selected features. Experiment 6: we select features by applying both SNR and SVM-RFE feature selection methods and after that we set up fuzzy support vector machine models on selected features. Experiment 1: the result of running the first experiment is presented in table 2. Fuzzy support vector machine classifier is sensitive to noisy and irrelevant features more than SVM, KNN, and DLDA classifiers but is not as sensitive as ANN and CART classifiers. Accuracy of fuzzy support vector machine model versus accuracy of common classification models used on microarrays when no feature selection step is taken. As you see in this table the performance of fuzzy support vector machine classifier is better than SVM, ANN, KNN, CART, and DLDA classifiers when we use a feature selection method as simple as SNR before setting up the classification model. As you see in this table the performance of fuzzy support vector machine model when SNR or SVM-RFE feature selection methods applied is better than the performance of fuzzy support vector machine model in case no feature selection step is taken. Rule-base of fuzzy support vector machine on leukemia dataset. It is important to emphasize that fuzzy support vector machine is not the only interpretable model suggested for microarray classification and there are other interpretable models like the iGEC proposed by Ho, Hsieh, Chen, and Huang  for microarray classification. But as you notice the fuzzy support vector machine model is not too much sensitive to the value of misclassification cost (C) parameter. Accuracy of fuzzy support vector machine for different values of C.\nExperiment 6: the result of running the sixth experiment is shown in Figure 4, 5, and 6. As you see, models built on features selected by both techniques are not sensitive to the changes of number of genes. Comparison of feature selection methods on colon cancer dataset. In this paper, we have analyzed the prediction power of fuzzy support vector machine classifier on three different microarray classification problems. The experimental results show that fuzzy support vector machine has several advantages for microarray classification. First, fuzzy support vector machine combined with a feature selection method has higher generalization ability than common classification models for microarrays like support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbor, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Second, this model is robust in terms of the value of the parameter C and is not sensitive to the changes of the number of selected features. The authors believe that an accurate and interpretable model like fuzzy support vector machine finds high interest among biologist, physicians, and bioinformaticians who work on microarray classification problem. MH designed the experiments, participated in the implementation of the FSVM technique, and drafted the manuscript. The role of the bit-based support vector machine (SVM) in mitigating distortions in millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber (RoF) mobile fronthaul systems is to serve as a non-parameter nonlinear mitigation approach. Overall, the bit-based support vector machine plays a crucial role in mitigating distortions in millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber mobile fronthaul systems by effectively handling nonlinear noise through its nonlinear decision boundaries and adaptability to specific system characteristics. (2007) compared different methods, such as Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) and Kernel Logistic Regression, for multi-class probabilities in medical decision making. (2014, 2015) developed automated classification systems using machine learning techniques like support vector machines and image processing with a local binary pattern operator. (2003) developed least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) models to predict the malignancy of ovarian tumors. Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about machine learning.

It is important to emphasize that fuzzy support vector machine is not the only interpretable model suggested for microarray classification and there are other interpretable models like the iGEC proposed by Ho, Hsieh, Chen, and Huang  for microarray classification. But as you notice the fuzzy support vector machine model is not too much sensitive to the value of misclassification cost (C) parameter. Accuracy of fuzzy support vector machine for different values of C.\nExperiment 6: the result of running the sixth experiment is shown in Figure 4, 5, and 6. As you see, models built on features selected by both techniques are not sensitive to the changes of number of genes. Comparison of feature selection methods on colon cancer dataset. In this paper, we have analyzed the prediction power of fuzzy support vector machine classifier on three different microarray classification problems. The experimental results show that fuzzy support vector machine has several advantages for microarray classification. First, fuzzy support vector machine combined with a feature selection method has higher generalization ability than common classification models for microarrays like support vector machine, artificial neural network, decision trees, k nearest neighbor, and diagonal linear discriminant analysis. Second, this model is robust in terms of the value of the parameter C and is not sensitive to the changes of the number of selected features. The authors believe that an accurate and interpretable model like fuzzy support vector machine finds high interest among biologist, physicians, and bioinformaticians who work on microarray classification problem. MH designed the experiments, participated in the implementation of the FSVM technique, and drafted the manuscript. The role of the bit-based support vector machine (SVM) in mitigating distortions in millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber (RoF) mobile fronthaul systems is to serve as a non-parameter nonlinear mitigation approach. Overall, the bit-based support vector machine plays a crucial role in mitigating distortions in millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber mobile fronthaul systems by effectively handling nonlinear noise through its nonlinear decision boundaries and adaptability to specific system characteristics. (2007) compared different methods, such as Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) and Kernel Logistic Regression, for multi-class probabilities in medical decision making. (2014, 2015) developed automated classification systems using machine learning techniques like support vector machines and image processing with a local binary pattern operator. (2003) developed least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) models to predict the malignancy of ovarian tumors. Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n"

The class C shatters the set A if for each subset a of A, there is some element c of C such that  Equivalently, C shatters A when their intersection is equal to A's power set: P(A) = { c ∩ A | c ∈ C }. We employ the letter C  to refer to a \"class\" or \"collection\" of sets, as in a Vapnik&ndash;Chervonenkis class (VC-class).\n\n"
