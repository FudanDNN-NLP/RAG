Hamiltonicity can be expressed in MSO2 by the existence of a set of edges that forms a connected 2-regular graph on all the vertices, with connectivity expressed as above and 2-regularity expressed as the incidence of two but not three distinct edges at each vertex. Although not part of the definition of MSO2, orientations of undirected graphs can be represented by a technique involving Trémaux trees.\n\n"
