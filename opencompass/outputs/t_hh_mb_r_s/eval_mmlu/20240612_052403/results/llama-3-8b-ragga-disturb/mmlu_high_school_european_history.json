The following passage shows Schiller applying the same sort of reasoning to the evolution of consciousness: \"Taken as the type of the pseudo-metaphysical method, which explains the higher by the lower ... it does not explain the genesis of consciousness out of unconscious matter, because we cannot, or do not, attribute potential consciousness to matter. Regardless of their complexity, they each depend upon the same essential twenty subsystems (or processes) in order to survive and to continue the propagation of their species or types beyond a single generation\". At each level, a system invariably comprises twenty critical subsystems, which process matter–energy or information except for the first two, which process both matter–energy and information: reproducer and boundary. Miller says the concepts of space, time, matter, energy, and information are essential to his theory because the living systems exist in space and are made of matter and \n\ningestor, distributor, converter, producer, storage, extruder, motor, supporter input transducer, internal transducer, channel and net, timer (added later), decoder, associator, memory, decider, encoder, output transducer The living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their structure, interaction, behavior and development. This work is created by James Grier Miller, which was intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's original conception as spelled out in his magnum opus Living Systems, a \"living system\" must contain each of twenty \"critical subsystems\", which are defined by their functions and visible in numerous systems, from simple cells to organisms, countries, and societies. The law of biogenesis, attributed to Louis Pasteur, is the observation that living things come only from other living things, by reproduction (e.g.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

To do this more effectively, they ransacked pagan Latin writings, particularly those of Varro, for everything that could be regarded by Christian standards as repulsive and irreligious.\" These Christian sources have had great influence on perceptions of this period by creating an impression of overt and continuous conflict that has been assumed on an empire-wide scale. Archaeological evidence indicates that, outside of violent rhetoric, the decline of paganism away from the imperial court was relatively non-confrontational. The Pax Romana had an effect on the adoption and acceptance of Christianity’s peaceful teachings and less so was Pax the signifier of peace – she was being replaced by Jesus Christ. A church leader in the 4th century Eusebius wrote ‘it was not by mere human accident but of God's arrangement that the universal empire of peace came in time for the universal religion of peace.’ The Roman peace at the time however was still regularly sustained \n\n asserting that the emperor was a soldier of God, not simply a personal believer but one bound by his position to serve the faith; under no circumstances could he agree to something that would promote the worship of idols. Their unique success in war, conquest, and the formation of an Empire, was attributed to the empire maintaining good relations with the gods through proper reverence and worship practices. Symmachus and his supporters, Romanness had nothing to do with Christianity, but depended on Rome's pagan past and its status as the heart of a vast and polytheistic empire. Like Symmachus, Ambrose saw Rome as the greatest city of the Roman Empire, but not because of its pagan past but because of its Christian present.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

Many Enlightenment philosophers defended the rights of women, including Jeremy Bentham (1781), Marquis de Condorcet (1790), and Mary Wollstonecraft (1792). Even so, salons, coffeehouses, debating societies, academic competitions and print all became avenues for women to socialize, learn and discuss enlightenment ideas. The Enlightenment came to advance ideals of liberty, progress, and tolerance. While women in England and France gained arguably more freedom than their counterparts in other countries, the role of women in the Enlightenment was typically reserved for those of middle and also the upper-class families, were then allowed and able to access money to join societies and the education to participate in debate. Therefore, the women in the Enlightenment only represented a small class of society and not the entire female sex. ; 4) In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions collected by general induction from phænomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, until such time \n\n During the Enlightenment, humanistic ideas resurfaced, this time further from religion and classical literature. Divinity was no longer dictating human morals, and humanistic values such tolerance and opposition to slavery started to take shape. Some thinkers rejected theism outright and various currents were formed; atheism, deism, and hostility to organized religion. Notably during the Enlightenment, Baruch Spinoza redefined God as signifying the totality of nature; Spinoza was accused of atheism but remained silent on the matter.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him.

A relatively early critic was Friedrich Nietzsche, who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza (\"Deutschland über alles\") \"die blödsinnigste Parole der Welt\" (the most idiotic slogan in the world), and in Thus Spoke Zarathustra said, \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles – I fear that was the end of German philosophy.\" The pacifist Kurt Tucholsky was also negative about the song, and in 1929 published a photo book sarcastically titled Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, criticising right-wing groups in Germany. However, for propaganda purposes, the latter translation was chosen by the Allies during World War I.\n\n starts with the words Deutschland, Deutschland über alles and is set to a 1797 tune by Joseph Haydn. The text of the song expresses the pan-German sentiments common to revolutionary republicans of the period, which were considered inflammatory and treasonous in the German-speaking principalities. The phrase über alles at that time did not refer to militant ideas of conquest of foreign countries, but to the need for loyalty to a united Germany above regional loyalties. In 1841, the German linguist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics of \"Das Lied der Deutschen\" as a new text for that music, counterposing the national unification of Germany to the eulogy of a monarch, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time. Along with the flag of Germany, which first appeared in its essentially \"modern\" form in 1778, it was one of the symbols of the March Revolution of 1848. In order to endorse its republican and liberal tradition, the song was chosen as the national anthem of Germany in 1922, during the Weimar Republic. In 1919 the black, red and gold tricolour, the colours of the 19th century liberal revolutionaries advocated by the political left and centre, was adopted (rather than the previous black, white and red of Imperial Germany). It was played at occasions of great national significance such as the opening of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin when Hitler and his entourage, along with Olympic officials, walked into the stadium amid a chorus of three thousand Germans singing \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles\". As to the Song of the Germans, base for the later German national anthem of the Weimar Republic (since 1922): \"Deutschland über Alles auf der ganzen Welt\" (Germany above everything in the whole world), Ponsonby claims, it was popularly accepted as meaning, \"(Let) Germany (rule) over every country in the whole world,\" i.e.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

The stability of Europe during the decades following the Congress of Vienna has led to widespread popularity of the idea of a Concert of Nations, though its (largely theoretical) application vary widely in their interpretations of what a Concert of Nations means for present-day international relations. The Concert of Democracies seems to follow closely on the heels of both Senator France and Senator Fulbright by proposing a concert limited to democratic countries that pursues democratic ideals like human rights and self-government. But in a similar vein, it also fails to address the significant ways in which it diverges from the Concert of Nations as understood by the Congress of Vienna: namely, its members are dependent on democratic support and it leaves out very powerful undemocratic nations. In practice, this means that the members of a Concert of Democracies would be subject to popular opinion for their continued participation, rather than on their imperialist good judgment. a memorandum that suggested giving to the Wittelsbach Emperor the bishoprics of Passau, Augsburg and Regensburg, as well as the imperial cities of Augsburg, Regensburg and Ulm.
