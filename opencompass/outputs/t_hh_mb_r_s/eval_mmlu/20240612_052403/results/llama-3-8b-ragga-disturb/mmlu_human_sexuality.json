It is important to note that while mammography does involve exposure to a low level of radiation, the benefits of early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer often outweigh this risk. It plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer, as it can detect abnormalities such as lumps or calcifications before they can be felt during a physical examination. Early detection leads to earlier treatment and improved outcomes for patients. While it is true that mammography does involve exposure to radiation, the level of radiation used is generally very low. The amount of radiation exposure from a mammogram is comparable to the radiation exposure an individual receives from natural sources in the environment over a few months. In addition, modern mammography machines and techniques have been refined and optimized to minimize radiation exposure while still providing high-quality images. Radiologists and technicians who perform mammograms are trained to use the lowest possible radiation dose while still obtaining clear and accurate images. In conclusion, while mammography does involve exposure to low levels of radiation, the benefits of early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer often outweigh this risk. This ensures that the area biopsies correlates to the abnormality seen on mammogram. The goal of early detection is to find the cancer when it is treatable. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, clinical breast exam, breast self-exam, thermography, tissue sampling and magnetic resonance imaging. There are various methods of breast imaging using a variety of technologies as described in detail below. Xeromammography and Galactography also use x-ray technology and are also used infrequently in the detection of breast cancer. Lastly, scintimammography is used in a subgroup of patients who have abnormal mammograms or whose screening is not reliable on the basis of using traditional mammography or ultrasound. Other tests, such as a skin check for skin cancer, have no significant risk of harm to the patient.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

Many of those infected, however, have no symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and azithromycin by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Sexual partners from the last two months should also be treated. An estimated 33 to 106 million new cases occur each year, out of the 498 million new cases of curable STI – which also includes syphilis, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The current name was first used by the Greek physician Galen before 200 CE who referred to it as \"an unwanted discharge of semen\". Signs and symptoms\nGonorrhea infections of mucosal membranes can cause swelling, itching, pain, and the formation of pus. Women\nHalf of women with gonorrhea are asymptomatic but the other half experience vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, or pain with sexual intercourse associated with inflammation of the uterine cervix. Common medical complications of untreated gonorrhea in women include pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause scars to the fallopian tubes and result in later ectopic pregnancy among those women who become pregnant. The most common medical complication of gonorrhea in men is inflammation of the epididymis. Gonorrhea is also associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. Infants\n\nIf not treated, gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum will develop in 28% of infants born to women with gonorrhea. In advanced cases, gonorrhea may cause a general feeling of tiredness similar to other infections. Spread\nThe infection is usually spread from one person to another through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Insertive MSM may get a penile infection from anal intercourse, while receptive MSM may get anorectal gonorrhea. A mother may transmit gonorrhea to her newborn during childbirth; when affecting the infant's eyes, it is referred to as ophthalmia neonatorum. Diagnosis\n\nTraditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with Gram stain and culture; however, newer polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common. Tests that use PCR (aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to N. gonorrhoeae are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the N. gonorrhoeae organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae. All people testing positive for gonorrhea should be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus. Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection. People diagnosed with gonorrhea infection have a fivefold increase risk of HIV transmission. Screening \n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases, is recommended as part of prenatal care in the United States. Prevention \n\nAs with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of condoms, not having sex, or can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person. Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow. Treatment\n\nAntibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat gonorrhea infections. Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications. Addition of topical antibiotics have not been shown to improve cure rates compared to oral antibiotics alone in treatment of eye infected gonorrhea. For newborns, erythromycin ointment is recommended as a preventative measure for gonococcal infant conjunctivitis. This is amplified by the fact that pharyngeal gonorrhoea is mostly asymptomatic, and gonococci and commensal Neisseria species can coexist for long time periods in the pharynx and share anti-microbial resistance genes. Accordingly, an enhanced focus on early detection (i.e., screening of high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men, PCR testing should be considered) and appropriate treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhoea is important. Sexual partners\nIt is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommend that individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for gonorrhea avoid sexual contact with others until at least one week past the final day of treatment in order to prevent the spread of the bacterium. The UK's Health Protection Agency reported that 2011 saw a slight drop in gonorrhea antibiotic resistance, the first in five years. In 2016, the WHO published new guidelines for treatment, stating \"There is an urgent need to update treatment recommendations for gonococcal infections to respond to changing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of N. gonorrhoeae. High-level resistance to previously recommended quinolones is widespread and decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporins, another recommended first-line treatment in the 2003 guidelines, is increasing and several countries have reported treatment failures.\" Prognosis\n\nGonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or petechia, septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. In men, inflammation of the epididymis, prostate gland, and urethra can result from untreated gonorrhea. In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is pelvic inflammatory disease. Men who have had a gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. Epidemiology\n\nAbout 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, out of the 448 million new cases of curable STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. In 2011, 321,849 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999. In 2004, the rate of reported gonorrheal infections was 113. In the US, it is the second-most-common bacterial sexually transmitted infections; chlamydia remains first. According to the CDC African Americans are most affected by gonorrhea, accounting for 69% of all gonorrhea cases in 2010. The World Health Organization warned in 2017 of the spread of untreatable strains of gonorrhea, following analysis of at least three cases in Japan, France and Spain, which survived all antibiotic treatment. In 1854, Dr. Wilhelm Gollmann addressed gonorrhea in his book, Homeopathic Guide to all Diseases Urinary and Sexual Organs. The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Research \nA vaccine for gonorrhea has been developed that is effective in mice. As N. gonorrhoeae is closely related to N. meningitidis and they have 80–90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines is plausible.

The proponent of the concept of the id, ego, and superego in psychology is Sigmund Freud. The id represents our basic, instinctual drives and operates on the pleasure principle, seeking immediate gratification of desires. It operates on an unconscious level and is constantly seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. Freud's concept of the id, ego, and superego provides a framework for understanding the conflicting forces that shape human behavior and contribute to psychological development. In Freudian psychoanalysis, the term \"id\" refers to a specific part of the psyche that operates at an unconscious level. It is important to note that the id is considered the oldest and most primitive part of the mind. Primitive and Impulsive: The id is considered the most primitive and impulsive part of the mind, driven by unconscious desires. It does not possess a sense of morality or concern for social norms and acts solely based on its instinctive impulses. It's important to note that the id exists in contrast to the ego and superego, which are the other two components of the psyche according to Freud's psychoanalytic theory. The ego mediates between the id's desires and the external world, while the superego represents the internalized moral values and ideals. Overall, the id plays a crucial role in Freudian psychoanalysis by shaping our unconscious desires, impulses, and instincts, which can influence our behavior and thoughts. In his structural theory, Sigmund Freud described the ego as the mediator between the id and super-ego and the external world. Freudians saw the ego as forming from separate \"nuclei\": 'A final ego is formed by synthetic integration of these nuclei, and in certain states of ego regression a split of the ego into its original nuclei becomes observable'. Ego defenses are often employed by the \n\n when id behaviour conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos, or an individual's internalization of these morals, norms, and taboos. Freud noted however that in the face of conflicts with superego or id, it was always 'possible for the ego to avoid a rupture by submitting to encroachments on its own unity and even perhaps by effecting a cleavage or division of itself'. In a late, unfinished paper he examined how sometimes 'the instinct is allowed to retain its satisfaction and proper respect is shown to reality...at the price of a rift in the ego which never heals but increases as time goes on...a splitting of the ego'.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

'Anger, annoyance, and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance, and 36% embarrassment. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and \n\n bodies and self-worth from their counterpart in a relationship setting. However, mediating role between pornography, and anxiety attachment, and body image self-consciousness was found only in women in a relationship at the time of the study, which correlated with attachment theory. Harnois and Bastos (2018) show an association between women's perceptions of workplace sexual harassment and self-reported physical health. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. For example, in 1995, Judith Coflin committed suicide after chronic sexual harassment by her bosses and coworkers. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying. There is some evidence linking experiences of sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence with patterns of victimization during adulthood. For instance, a case control study in Australia on the long-term impact of abuse reported significant associations between child sexual abuse and experiencing rape, sexual and mental health problems, domestic violence and other problems in intimate relationships even after accounting for various family background characteristics. Those who had experienced abuse involving intercourse had more negative outcomes than those suffering other types of coercion.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

The abuse of cocaine has been linked to various complications during pregnancy, including placental abruption, preterm labor, and low birth weight. Children exposed to cocaine in utero may experience cognitive and developmental issues. Studies have shown that cocaine-exposed children may have lower verbal-reasoning scores and smaller head circumference compared to non-exposed children. Growing up in an environment where cocaine abuse is present can also increase the risk of substance abuse and addiction later in life. It is important to note that these consequences are not limited to cocaine use alone. Substance abuse, including abuse of other substances and comorbid psychiatric illness, often co-occur with cocaine abuse. This can further exacerbate the risks and complications associated with cocaine use during pregnancy. Overall, the potential risks and consequences of cocaine abuse during pregnancy and for children exposed to cocaine in utero are serious. Cocaine use results in a smaller brain, which results in learning disabilities for the fetus. Cocaine puts the fetus at a higher risk of being stillborn or premature. The vasoconstriction of the effects of cocaine lead to a decrease in placental blood flow to the fetus that results in fetal hypoxia that is oxygen deficiency and decreased fetal nutrition these vasoconstrictive effects on the placenta have been linked to the number of complications in malformations that are evident in the newborn. Cocaine has also been shown to have teratogenic effects on fetal development. The U.S. General Accounting Office estimated that 5 million or more women have used nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs during pregnancy. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 5.5% of women used an illicit drug, 18.8% used alcohol and 20.4% smoked cigarettes during pregnancy. Evidence from clinical reports and case studies suggests that a pregnant woman and her developing fetus are at risk for a wide range of potential problems when cocaine is present. Among the medical complications attributed to cocaine use in a pregnant woman are cardiovascular effects including acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, rupture of the ascending aorta, central nervous system complications including aneurysms due to increases in blood pressure, and other, less frequently occurring effects such as respiratory arrest and seizures. The medical complications that may result from the life-style associated with drug use include failure to seek proper prenatal care, nutritional deficits, and weight loss. Cocaine also crosses the placental barrier and can result in detrimental effects to the fetus. Unfortunately, studies have also shown associations between cocaine use during pregnancy and the occurrence of fetal anomalies, including an increase in skull malformations, limb defects, urethral obstruction, enlarged bladder, cystic distension of the kidneys, and neural defects. In addition to effects on physical development, neurological and behavioral abnormalities observed in cocaine-exposed infants have included tremulousness, muscle rigidity, and poor performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS). Cocaine exposure has also been associated with brain stem auditory defects, perinatal cerebral infarction, and vision problems. Cocaine-exposed infants are largely unable to respond to the human voice and face, and are unable to interact with others. Most children who were exposed to cocaine before birth have normal intelligence. However, studies of cocaine-exposed school-aged children do suggest subtle effects on intelligence and behavior.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

Gay men are also caught between these two contrasting images. On one hand they do not have women’s ‘‘natural’’ ability to care for children, are perceived as sexually (over)active and potentially predatory and, like lesbians, too political; on the other hand they are more maternal and more feminine than heterosexual men. The underlying assumption is that gay men and lesbians are different in some essential way from heterosexual people, and this difference implicates their aberrant gender expression. Therefore, they are unable to model appropriate gender behavior to their children, for example, the assumption that gay fathers are unable to bathe their daughters or discuss puberty and menstruation. Although American network television had gay and lesbian characters in both daytime and prime time, many of those characters only made guest appearances, were minor in importance, or received little storyline beyond coming out or other struggles related to their sexuality. Kevin was the rare gay character who was already out both to his family and in the workplace. The stated goal of the show to treat Kevin as an equal to, no better or worse than, the straight characters received praise from critics such as Robert Bianco. Kisses between men had been especially rare on network television; Melrose Place edited out a gay kiss, Dawson's Creek had \n\nThe sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) is an ovoid, densely packed cluster of large cells located in the medial preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus which is believed to be related to sexual behavior in animals. No sex differences have been observed in the human SDN in either cell density or mean diameter of the cell nuclei. SDN and its homologues exist widely in human, mammal, and some other animal brains, including:\n the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3) in humans;\n ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (MPOA/AH) in sheep;\n sexually dimorphic nucleus in the preoptic area (SDN-POA) in rats;\n anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc) in macaques;\n specific area in medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in quails; etc. Sexually dimorphic nucleus in medial preoptic area\n\nFormation and organization of SDN in medial preoptic area\n\nSex differences in SDN caused by exposure to testosterone (prenatal)\n\nThe volume of SDN in medial preoptic area is modified by hormones, among which testosterone is proved to be of much importance. Also, there is evidence that testosterone acts during specific prenatal period to organize the development of aromatase-expressing neurons into the male-typical SDN (testosterone is transformed to estrogen by aromatase). It is proved that Bcl-2 level in AVPV is higher whereas Bax level is lower in females than in males, just as being opposite of those in MPNc. Role of SDN in controlling of male sexual behaviors\n\nMale sexual behaviors can be divided into two phases: the appetitive phase, which contains highly variable sequence of behaviors such as attracting and courting, and the consummatory phase, during which highly stereotyped copulatory behaviors occur. Moreover, a study on medial preoptic nucleus (POM) (homologue of medial preoptic nucleus in rats) in quails showed that the activation of male copulatory behavior requires the aromatization of androgen (testosterone) into an estrogen (17β-estradiol). The intensity of male copulatory behavior is found to positively correlate with the number of the aromatase-expression neurons in the caudal part of POM. Appetitive behaviors are also partly controlled by medial preoptic area as aromatase-knockout mice show deficits in sexual motivation. Furthermore, in vivo dialysis experiments showed that the level of extracellular dopamine in the mPOA increases as the sexual appetitive sequences progress. Role of SDN in sexual partner preference\n\nRole of SDN in male partner preference\nResearches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep demonstrate that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) have been found to have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams. Other species have similar relationships between sexual preferences and the volume of SDN. For example, INAH3 in humans (homologue of oSDN) is significantly larger in heterosexual men than in homosexual men. Damage of SDN and changes in sexual partner preferences in males\n\nBilateral damage to SDN in the medial preoptic area in male ferrets causes the change of males from male-typical preference to female-typical preference. Role of SDN in female partner preference\n\nAlthough SDN is much related to sexual partner preferences in males, it does not show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite for the expression of male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. Comparison of the AHdc nucleus volumes between Japanese macaque and rhesus macaque (a closely related sister species of Japanese macaque) shows that there is no significant difference between the volume of AHdc in more male-typical macaques and that in female-typical macaques. Role of SDN in Human Sexual Orientation\nIn 1991, LeVay published a study of 41 autopsies on 16 heterosexual men, 19 homosexual men, and 6 heterosexual women that targeted the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 1, 2, 3, and 4). He showed that there were no significant differences between the three groups' INAH 1, 2, and 4, which prior research already showed. However, INAH 3 was larger in heterosexual men in comparison to homosexual men and heterosexual women. This research linked an established sexually dimorphic area of the brain to hetero- and homosexual behavior in men. A later study determined that the size of the INAH3 of homosexual men was intermediate between that of heterosexual men and heterosexual women. It also determined that the reason why the INAH3 is smaller in homosexual versus heterosexual men is because homosexual men have a higher neuronal packing density (the number of neurons per cubic millimeter) in the INAH3 than heterosexual men; there is no difference in the number or cross-sectional area of neurons in the INAH3 of homosexual versus heterosexual men. It was also found that there is no effect of HIV infection on the size of INAH3, that is, HIV infection cannot account for the observed difference in INAH3 volume between homosexual and heterosexual men. These findings only partially corroborate LeVay's hypothesis that homosexual males have a \"female-like hypothalamus\" — given that the INAH3 was smaller in homosexual men, intermediate in size between that of heterosexual males and heterosexual females. Furthermore, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of homosexual males is larger than the SCN of heterosexual men and women; both the volume and the number of neurons of the SCN are twice as many in homosexual males than in heterosexual males. These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. In sum, some contemporaries cast serious doubt over LeVay's hypothesis that homosexual males have a \"female hypothalamus\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \"male brain from originally female brain\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.

A large proportion of the Abrahamic sects view sexual relationships outside of a heterosexual marriage, including sex between same-sex partners, negatively, though there are groups within each faith that disagree with orthodox positions and challenge their doctrinal authority. One of the main factors is the belief that sexual activity should be restricted to certain situations or within specific boundaries in order to maintain moral and spiritual purity. Religions often view sexuality as a powerful force that needs to be channeled in a way that promotes harmony, fidelity, and family stability. Many religions view sexual activity primarily as a means of reproduction and therefore place a strong emphasis on responsible and purposeful sexual behavior within the context of marriage. Additionally, social and cultural norms play a significant role in shaping the emphasis on sexual behavior within religions. These norms are often influenced by historical, geographical, and cultural factors, which can vary widely among different religious traditions. The interpretations of religious texts and teachings also contribute to the specific emphasis placed on sexual behavior within each religion. It is important to note that while many religions emphasize sexual morality, the specific teachings and practices regarding sexual behavior can differ greatly among different religious traditions. The variations are influenced by the foundational beliefs, cultural contexts, and historical developments of each religion. Overall, the emphasis on sexual behavior in world religions is influenced by a combination of moral, procreative, social, and cultural factors, all of which contribute to the formation of religious teachings and practices regarding sexuality. The Mishneh Torah, a text considered authoritative by Orthodox Jewish sects, states \"since a man's wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse.\" He views sexuality as a meaningful aspect of human behavior, giving it significance beyond being a mere biological or physiological urge.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

According to Freud, the correct order of psychosexual development is as follows: oral, anal, phallic, latent, and genital phases. If this stage is not successfully resolved, Freud believed that individuals may develop oral fixations in later life, leading to behaviors such as nail-biting or smoking. Freud proposed that unresolved conflicts during this stage could result in either anal retentive behaviors (excessive cleanliness and perfectionism) or anal expulsive behaviors (messiness and impulsiveness) in adulthood. Next comes the phallic stage, which takes place between the ages of 3 and 6 years. This stage is characterized by increased focus on the genitals, as children become interested in exploring their own bodies and notice differences between genders. According to Freud, during this stage, children develop unconscious sexual desires towards the parent of the opposite sex, known as the Oedipus or Electra complex. Freud believed that the latent phase serves as a time of psychological rest and consolidation, as children develop skills and engage in non-sexual activities such as friendships and hobbies. Freud viewed successful resolution of previous stages as crucial for healthy development during this phase, allowing individuals to form intimate and fulfilling relationships. It is important to note that although Freud's theory of psychosexual development has had a significant influence on psychology and psychiatry, other theorists and researchers have presented different perspectives on human development. Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual \n\n the stage in child development (between ages of three and six). By directly applying the techniques employed in Freudian dream analysis, the psychoanalytic critic believes \n\nIn the phallic stage of psychosexual development, pleasure is gained from the child's own genitals.As the child develops, say from age two to three, the erogenous zone becomes the anus, with the socially acceptable expression of pleasure being bowel control.In the oral stage, pleasure is gained primarily through the mouth.Two culture-bound syndromes will serve as examples:\n\n**Koro** (East and Southeast Asia): an episode of sudden and intense anxiety in which the penis (or in the rare female cases, the vulva and nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death\n\n**Anorexia nervosa** (North America, western Europe): severe restriction of food intake, associated with morbid fear of obesity\n\nThese syndromes indicate the important role that cultural beliefs and mores play in determining mental health and illness. West African followers of the Vodun religion believe that such objects possess divine powers of rejuvenation._\n\n# Psychosexual Development\n\n**1905**\n\n## **Sigmund Freud** (1856­–1939)\n\nSigmund Freud suggested that a normal part of psychological development is the experience of the **Oedipus Complex** , in which the child longs for possession of the parent of the opposite sex and the demise of the same-sex parent. Freud's clinical and theoretical work led him to posit that children from the time of birth are polymorphously perverse, or capable of experiencing pleasure from the stimulation of any part of the body. As physical and psychological development progresses, specific parts of the body become the focal points of pleasure. These psychosexual stages are oral, anal, phallic, then a period of latency, and finally the genital stage. In the phallic stage of psychosexual development, pleasure is gained from the child's own genitals.The immediate, always imperfect, resolution of the conflict comes when the child identifies with the same-sex parent.The child then enters the latency period, where there is little psychosexual development.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

On the other hand, the nucleus accumbens area of the brain is activated when someone who is deeply in love experiences rejection from their partner. From a psychological standpoint, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach rather than just an emotional experience. One popular theory is Sternberg's triangular theory of love, which suggests that love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment. Initially, partners may be attracted to each other based on sex appeal, which can then lead to the development of intimacy and bonding in a loving relationship. It is associated with components such as intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment, which contribute to the overall experience of romantic love. Social psychological approaches to explaining love have been developed to help further explain the psychological components involved in love. One of the more prominent concepts pertaining to love was proposed by Robert J. Sternberg known as the \"Triangular theory of love\". The three sides are Intimacy, Passion, and Commitment. For example, Intimacy plus Passion leads to romantic love while Intimacy plus Commitment leads to compassionate love. Triangular theories do not solely apply to one's own current relationship, they also can be meant for explaining what different levels of intimacy/passion/commitment mean in an imbalanced triangle, or even determine your love triangle for a preference of relationship. Couples \n\nIn the first stage of love, sex appeal initially attracts partners to each other, which may lead to intimacy (connectedness and bonding with each other in a loving relationship).According to this theory, love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment.Paternal inheritance was effective in preventing the depletion of farmland. In addition, different parts of the brain play important roles in the perception of romantic love. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens area of the brain is activated when a person who is madly in love is dumped by the partner.12 Therefore, romantic love can be viewed as a motivation and goal-oriented approach in humans rather than as a purely emotional endeavor. Several psychologists have attempted to define romantic love from a different standpoint. In general, romantic love has three components: attachment, caregiving, and sex.13 Sternberg postulated a triangular theory of love. According to this theory, love has three components: intimacy, passion, and decision/commitment. In the first stage of love, sex appeal initially attracts partners to each other, which may lead to intimacy (connectedness and bonding with each other in a loving relationship).In the last step, a decision may be made by both partners to continue the romantic relation, or it may be a commitment in which both partners are committed to each other and to continuing the love for a long time.14\n\nLarge Brain and Monogamy\n\nOne of the biological bases of human monogamy may be related to the large brain size of humans compared to the body.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human sexuality.

In general, however, it encourages abortion when the pregnancy endangers the woman's life and permits it if it will cause her severe physical or psychological harm. In the absence of clear threats to a mother's life, the permissibility of abortion is a controversial issue in Jewish texts. Despite their general opposition to abortion, fundamentalist churches that include the conservative evangelical, Non-denominational, Independent Baptist and Pentecostal movements, do not have a consensus doctrine regarding abortion. While these movements hold in common that abortion (when there is no threat to the life of the mother) is a form of infanticide, there is no consensus as to whether exceptions should be allowed when the mother's life is in mortal danger, or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. A 2014 Guttmacher survey of US abortion patients found that many reported a religious affiliation—24% were Catholic while 30% were Protestant. A 1995 survey reported that Catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy, Protestants are less likely to do so, and Evangelical Christians are the least likely to do so. Through most of its history the Catholic Church was divided on whether it believed that early abortion was murder, and it did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century. Several historians have written that prior to the 19th century most Catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before \"quickening\" or \"ensoulment\" as an \n\nThe historical relationship between Christianity and abortion is complex and varied. However, it's important to note that interpretations and attitudes towards abortion within Christianity have evolved over time.
