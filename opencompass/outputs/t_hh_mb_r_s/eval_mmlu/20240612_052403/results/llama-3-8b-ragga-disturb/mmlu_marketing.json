This can reduce consumers’ apprehension about buying a new product or introduce them to a product they were unfamiliar with before. The objective behind distributing samples is to familiarize physicians with a particular drug, increasing the likelihood of them prescribing it in the future. toothbrushes that change color when they are about to wear out (signaling that the consumer needs to repurchase) ; Novel packaging, e.g. packaging that has residual value once the original contents have been consumed such as a jam/coffee jar that can be reused as a drinking vessel or storage container ; Add-on gifts or give-aways, e.g. toys included in children's fast food meal packs, cover mounts on magazines, toy in a cereal box ; Any novel or unexpected sales promotion In marketing, the use of gimmicks can be an important part of the sales promotions effort. However, finding a successful gimmick for an otherwise mundane product can be challenging as it requires some effort \n\nThe following is a guest post by Grace-Marie Turner, founder and president of the Galen Institute, a non-profit research organization focusing on patient-centered solutions to health reform. People react to the exact same treatment in very different ways. Some lawmakers see this requirement as a step toward an outright ban on free samples, making it more difficult for doctors to customize drug treatments for their patients. In fact, these samples actually save our health system money in the long run. Doctors use them as a way to test treatments before asking patients (and/or their insurers) to pay for a full supply. Drugs samples are also a valuable supplement to the drug industry’s efforts to give low-income patients access to needed medications. A 2006 poll published in the Journal of Medical Ethics found that 90 percent of physicians and pharmacists consider the practice ethical. And a 1995 survey in the Journal of the American Board of Family Practice found that 90 percent of patients believe it’s okay for their doctor to accept samples from drug makers. So if drug samples are popular with physicians and patients, why are lawmakers demonizing them in this new health law? Critics charge that samples are nothing more than a marketing gimmick to get patients to purchase more drugs. It’s ridiculous to think that doctors’ ethical principles could be bought off for a few free drug samples. Many good points have been made in this article. While look-back studies are a real PIA, this should not deter anyone who may have received these free samples to if they took the drug. For example: a physician in Kerrville, TX gives a patient a free sample and the patient has an adverse reaction to it, then logic would say that the physician would find a different medication to treat the disease. What if the medication is later found to affect most patient’s in the same manner as his patient, does the patient remember anything about the medication, except that it was free and didn’t work. So before saying that Govt is just out to control an industry, blah blah blah, one might consider that they are actually working to be able to track drugs for the good of the patient. And that has detrimental consequences, so whine and then look past how much “extra work” it may cause and start considering this from the patient’s perspective. So, after a pharma company ensures request and receipt of the drugs, it is then left up to the practitioner to track these samples down to the patient level (so this is where the gap lies), as a pharma company cannot track down to a patient level. I mean come on….did the banning of pens, clocks and pads (which costs pennies to make) distributed by drug reps to physicians really help any practitioner to prescribe one drug over another? What’s left and how can new therapies (meant to benefit the patient) be distributed to physicians if every where a pharma company turns, is greeted by a brick wall. In my opinion, the potential banning of samples will force physicians to prescribe drugs to patients that may not work. It will take longer to discover what works and what does not work — it will also cost the patient more out of pocket costs because full prescriptions will have to be brought. A sample is just that, a sample. Obviously meant to promote the sale of anything. For example: Go into Sam’s Club — taste it, like it, you buy it. If you don’t like what you’ve tasted, keep walking, no harm, no foul. The unintended consequences of reporting these samples is huge. Look at it this way- many uninsured and under insured patients we see cannot afford their prescriptions so we give them samples. Now the monetary value of these samples are being listed as a “gift” to the prescribing doctor. So please people, calm down about samples- in the long run they keep costs way down for everyone. The distribution of free samples of new drugs to practicing physicians can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, free samples allow physicians to try out new drugs without incurring any cost to the patient. It also gives physicians the opportunity to assess the drug's efficacy and tolerability before prescribing it to their patients. However, there are potential issues and consequences associated with this practice. When the free samples run out, patients or their insurance carriers may need to bear the higher cost of the new drug, which can be a financial burden. When physicians receive free samples from pharmaceutical companies, it may influence their prescribing behavior. They may be more inclined to prescribe the drug they have received samples of, even if it is not the most appropriate choice for every patient. This tactic aims to maintain the exclusive marketing status of the brand-name drug and extend its profitability. Such practices can hinder competition and potentially lead to higher drug costs for patients. ADEs and ADRs can be a significant concern, as they may pose health risks to patients. In summary, while distributing free samples of new drugs to practicing physicians can have benefits such as facilitating trial and assessment of new treatments, there are potential drawbacks.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about marketing.
