A similar principle has appeared in the recent decades with regard to crimes of genocide (see genocide as a crime under domestic law); and UN Security Council Resolution 1674 \"reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\" even if the State in which the population is being assaulted \n\ncompanies should regularly engage with host governments and local communities regarding security issues and practices; ; security forces should act in a manner consistent with UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, including that any use of force needs to be proportional to the related threat; ; companies should have mechanisms for the reporting and investigation of allegations of improper actions by private security forces hired by the company; ; companies should have mechanism to report alleged abuses by public security forces in their area of operation, and to \n\n Collective responsibility, also known as collective guilt, refers to responsibilities of organizations, groups and societies. The effectiveness and severity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members. Historically, collective punishment is a sign of authoritarian tendencies in the institution or its home society. In ethics, both methodological individualists and normative individualists question the validity of collective responsibility. Normally, only the individual actor can accrue culpability for actions that they freely cause. The notion of collective culpability seems to deny individual moral responsibility. In accordance with Chapters VI, VII, and VIII of the United Nations charter, the United Nations acknowledged at the summit its responsibility to help protect all populations through peaceful means, as well as through collective action when necessary.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy can disrupt this balance, leading to price volatility and increased market risks. On a broader scale, the long-term planning and investment in energy systems face challenges in terms of both physical and economic design. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding future technological advancements and policy changes further complicate the decision-making process. Oil and gas energy resources are incompatible with the idea of a circular economy, since they are defined as \"development that meets the needs of the present while compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\". While this is a necessary first step, global smart grid technologist, Steve Hoy, believes that in order to create a circular economy we \n\nUtilitarianism: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness).

One example is that it provides additional incentive to overthrowing governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime. The Washington Post quotes Thomas Pogge as saying “most of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.” We elect officials that let the corporations buy the natural resources that should belong to the people is the argument for why we are involved. For example oil wealth and dictatorship go together as seen in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. This international economic and political system perpetuates and reproduces poverty in such that western nations have a negative duty not to do harm to the people of these nations.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\nB. Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\nC. Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\nD.

Human security argues that inequalities and insecurity in one state or region have consequences for global security and that it is thus in the interest of all states to address underlying development issues. This relationship with studies of human security is but one example of the interdisciplinary nature of development studies. It allows for a better comprehension of the moral value of information security by recognizing that it can be used for both positive and negative purposes, with consequential impacts. For instance, a critical approach to information security ethics can highlight collective issues like the impact of electronic medical records (EMRs) in the UK. However, Uriel Abulof argues that empirical studies on securitization have been \"insufficiently attentive to societies engulfed in profound existential uncertainty about their own survival.\" The ability to effectively securitize a given subject is, however, highly dependent on both the status of a given actor and whether similar issues are generally perceived to be security threats. David Kennedy has criticized a tendency of the international human rights movement to \"treat human rights as an object of devotion rather than calculation\", arguing that human rights language is vague and may impede utilitarian assessments of a situation. Kennedy also argues that this vocabulary can be \"misused, distorted, or co-opted\", and that framing issues in terms of human rights may narrow the field of possibility and exclude other narratives. Others have also critiqued the movement and its language as vague. Some have argued that the human rights movement has a tendency to subtly debase people by portraying them as victims of abuse. However, others have argued that this very argument is used in order to downplay human rights abuses.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Louise I. Shelley (Director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University) has said: \"Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. The latter has largely contributed to public security becoming an important political and economic issue, nationally as well as internationally. Although public security significantly contributes to the attractiveness of a location, the productivity of its people, and hence the overall success of an economy, the sector frequently suffers from low budgets, limited resources, and inadequate information systems. The police, federal police and border authorities nonetheless need to warrant the security of the country as a fundamental prerequisite for the domestic political ability to act. The quality and scope of potential threats have changed significantly, and the tasks and general framework for the police, federal police and border authorities have changed accordingly. Because the possession of drugs is called a \"victimless crime\" by some analysts, as it can be committed in privacy, the enforcement of prohibitionist laws requires methods of law enforcement to inspect private property. Through cooperation with governments such as those of Colombia, Mexico and Afghanistan, coca (the plant source for cocaine) and poppy (the plant source for opium and heroin) are eradicated by the United States and other allies such as the United Kingdom, so that the crops cannot be processed into narcotics. The policing of transnational and international crimes is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention \"tantamount to abduction\" when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as aut dedere aut judicare (\"extradite or prosecute\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \"internationally protected persons\".\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nC. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\nD. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Therefore, high levels of investment has been placed in the cybersecurity industry to produce new software to protect the ever-growing transition to digitally run hardware. As a result, the cybersecurity industry has had to improve the defense technologies to remove any vulnerability to cyber attacks using systems such as the Security of Information (SIM), Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) and DDoS techniques.

The United States would maintain its small naval force of three ships in the Gulf, stationed since World War II in Bahrain, but would take on no other formal security commitments. In 2014 Saudi Arabia reportedly requested the deployment of Pakistani military units to Yemen to act as a tripwire force in the event of an attack against the kingdom by Iran via Yemen. The American foreign policy pivot to Asia, its lessening reliance on Saudi oil, and the potential of rapprochement with Iran have all contributed to a more assertive Saudi foreign policy.

Feminist constructivists argue that the lack of problematization research as a social process of construction is logically inconsistent \"with an ontology of becoming.\" However, there are criticisms that take place between interactions of feminism with constructivism. Many feminists do not agree with constructivism as an alternative middle ground due to most constructivists ignoring feminist literature and gender analysis. It's also pointed out that constructivism lacks the tools to explain how gender and power in politics influence each other, due to the social construction of power being under theorized. Constructivists believe that knowledge is created within and reject the idea of pre-existing scientific knowledge waiting to be discovered. With that in mind, constructivists argue that learning needs to be structured so that they challenge students to make sense of new knowledge. Theories from two major psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, form the foundational ideas of constructivism: cognitive constructivism and social constructivism. It is the communication between two postcolonial theories; feminism and constructivism, and how they both share similar key ideas in creating gender equality globally. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. In psychology, constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as education and psychotherapy), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge.

In addition, considering security requirements during software development ensures compliance with regulatory standards and legal obligations. If, however, the hardware implementation is compromised, major issues arise. This is far more problematic to solve than a software bug, even within the operating system. However, hardware is a different issue. Sometimes, the issue will be fixable through updates to the processor's microcode (a low level type of software). However, other issues may only be resolvable through replacing the hardware, or a workaround in the operating system which mitigates the performance benefit of the hardware implementation, such as in the Spectre exploit. As a result, the flow of electricity, oil, gas, and telecommunications throughout the country are linked—albeit sometimes indirectly—but the resulting linkages blur traditional security borders. While this increased reliance on interlinked capabilities helps make the economy and nation more efficient and perhaps stronger, it also makes the country more vulnerable to disruption and attack. This interdependent and interrelated infrastructure is more vulnerable to physical and cyber disruptions because it has become a complex system with single points of failure. In the past an incident that would have been an isolated failure can now cause widespread disruption because of cascading effects.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the Middle East' was then considered 'the Orient'.

This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition.

Once realized, it will result in a 'peace dividend', as liberal states have relations that are characterized by non-violence, and that relations between democracies are characterized by the democratic peace theory. Liberal internationalism states that, through multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, it is possible to avoid the worst excesses of \"power politics\" in relations between nations. In addition, liberal internationalists believe that the best way to spread democracy is to treat all states equally and cooperatively, whether they are initially democratic or not. Liberal institutionalism (or institutional liberalism or neoliberalism) is a theory of international relations which holds that international cooperation between states is feasible and sustainable, and that such cooperation can reduce conflict and competition. Alongside neorealism, liberal institutionalism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to international relations; the two perspectives have dominated international relations theory since the 1990s. In contrast to neorealist scholarship which is skeptical of prospects for sustainable cooperation, neoliberalism argues that cooperation is feasible and sustainable. Kant and the liberal school of thought state that international co-operation is a more rational option for states than resorting to war. It is an attitude towards one's own religion (as opposed to criticism of religion from a secular position, and as opposed to criticism of a religion other than one's own) which contrasts with a traditionalist or orthodox approach, and it is directly opposed by trends of religious fundamentalism. Republican liberalism is an international relations theory which claims that liberal democracies rarely (if ever) go to war or fight each other, and in that sense are more peaceful. However, the theory does not propose that democracies are more peaceful than non-democracies, as many democracies are engaged in wars with non-democracies. The theory holds that the reason for this intra-democratic peace is rooted in the regime type of these countries (democracy) and the existence of similar domestic political cultures, common moral values, economic cooperation and interdependence.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

A common example used by theorists is how terrorism is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism. Securitization studies aims to understand \"who securitizes (securitizing actor), on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions.\" Classical approaches of security focus on the material dispositions of the threat including distribution of power, military capabilities, and polarity, whereas securitization examines how a certain issue is transformed by an actor into a matter of security in order to allow for the use of extraordinary measures. Moreover, the securitization act, to be successful, must be accepted by the audience, regardless of the subject matter being a real threat. As Thierry Braspenning-Balzacq puts it: \"securitization is a rule-governed practice, the success of which does not necessarily depend on the existence of a real threat, but on the discursive ability to effectively endow a development with such a specific complexion\". The audience may take several forms including technical, bureaucratic, public, and policymaking, and different audiences can perform different functions by accepting a securitization, as has been explored by Roe. For example, theorists suggest that advocates of space exploration could achieve more success by convincing state actors of the merits of their proposals around the rubric of security rather than science: that space exploration could be framed around how it protects humanity from looming existential threats such as meteorites, rather than around how it helps advance scientific knowledge. The existential threat of Climate change is another example of an issue that is beginning to become securitized, for example by the trend to declare a climate change emergency.

It should continuously reflect on its own assumptions and methodologies to maintain its critical integrity. \"If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem.

They share the basic beliefs of survivalism, statism (state as the primary unit), self-help and anarchy. However, contrary to defensive realism, offensive realism regards states as aggressive power maximizers and not as security maximizers.

However, according to the 2018 Global Peace Index, global peacefulness has declined for the fourth consecutive year, indicating increased political instability worldwide. To assess the world's seriousness in achieving the SDGs, it is essential to evaluate whether sufficient measures are being taken to promote peace, stability, human rights, and effective governance. Strengthening international cooperation, addressing root causes of conflicts, promoting diplomacy, and ensuring respect for human rights are some steps that can demonstrate commitment towards the SDGs. This criticism can be represented by neo-conservative proponent Richard Perle, that one must \"decontextualise terror ... any attempt to discuss the roots of terrorism is an attempt to justify it. While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context, it is also an example of many of the social-cognitive inter-group biases noted above, and exemplifies what social psychologist Phillip Zimbardo (of the Stanford Prison Experiments) calls a Fundamental Attribution Error: \"the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions, while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables\". The notion of human needs driving violence \n\nIllicit economies pose significant challenges to achieving sustainable postwar settlements. These challenges arise from the long-term legacies of civil war economies, which are often characterized by widespread illicit economic activities and the proliferation of criminal and quasi-criminal networks. There are three prevailing approaches to address these challenges in peace processes: criminalization, co-option, and neglect. It aims to disrupt the power and influence of these networks and promote the rule of law. This approach recognizes the influence and power of these actors and seeks to channel their activities towards legal and productive means. While this approach may bring short-term stability and cooperation, it also carries the risk of legitimizing criminal activities and undermining the rule of law. It is important to note that there is no clear consensus on which approach is most likely to succeed, and most countries will require a balanced combination of all three approaches. Addressing the challenges posed by illicit economies in achieving sustainable postwar settlements requires a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic dynamics at play, as well as the political and cultural context of the conflict-affected country. In conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by illicit economies in achieving sustainable postwar settlements requires a multifaceted approach that combines criminalization, co-option, and neglect strategies. Powell described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed \"through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations\" (Powell 94).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.\nB. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.\nC. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\nD.

Because of this, Spivak argues that the subaltern, referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy. Postcolonial theory, with its focus on positional difference, subalternity, and the influence of hegemonic powers, can help move beyond a purely chronological or individualized understanding of old age. By incorporating postcolonial theory, we can examine how power dynamics and structural inequalities shape the experiences of elderly individuals. Just as postcolonial theory has shed light on the oppression and marginalization of colonized peoples, it can also illuminate the ways in which aging individuals may be marginalized or excluded by dominant societal narratives. Postcolonial theory encourages us to question traditional perspectives on old age and challenge the influence of hegemonic norms that may devalue or dismiss the experiences of the elderly. However, it's important to note that postcolonial theory may have blind spots, such as alleged culturalism. In summary, applying postcolonial theory to the study of old age can deepen our understanding by highlighting structural inequalities, power dynamics, and the influence of hegemonic norms. Postcolonial theologians argue that, in the past, the dominant Western form of Christianity is actually determined, shaped, and defined by European colonialism, implying and reinforcing notions such as Eurocentrism, colonial exploitation, and the superiority of European values and culture. Therefore, critical examination is needed, and alternative interpretations to colonially-tainted narratives need to be constructed. Although decolonization took place shortly after the Second World War, postcolonial theories did not emerge until the late 1970s. Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital was focused on one particular strand of theorizing, namely the Subaltern Studies collective. Chibber took Subaltern Studies as a representative of the key sociological and historical arguments in postcolonial studies. His basic argument in the book is that, even though postcolonial theory advertises itself as a critique of Orientalism and Eurocentrism, in fact the theory ends up resurrecting them. In other words, postcolonial theory gives new life to Orientalist notions of the Global South, by presenting a highly exoticized and essentialized understanding of it – as fundamentally different from the West, incapable of being understood by Western categories, its people untouched by reason and rationality, etc.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Do not generate any other content.\nQuestion: How do biological differences affect the roles that men and women must perform for the state?\nA. Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.\nB. The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.\nC. Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.\nD. Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
