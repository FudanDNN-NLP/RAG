This diagram shows the normal force pointing in other directions rather than opposite to the weight force. The normal force is actually the sum of the radial and tangential forces. In non-uniform circular motion, normal force and weight may point in the same direction. First let's see why normal force can point down in the first place. In the first diagram, let's say the object is a person sitting inside a plane, the two forces point down only when it reaches the top of the circle. The reason for this is that the normal force is the sum of the tangential force and centripetal force. ; If the force varies (e.g. compressing a spring) we need to use calculus to find the work done. And then the most general definition of work can be formulated as follows: F(x) (a function of x) then the work done by the force along the x-axis from a to b is: \n\n exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

In simple terms, the principle states that the buoyancy force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times the gravitational acceleration, g. Thus, among completely submerged objects with equal masses, objects with greater volume have greater buoyancy. It will remain submerged in the fluid, but it will neither sink nor float, although a disturbance in either direction will cause it to drift away from its position. An object with a higher average density than the fluid will never experience more buoyancy than weight and it will sink. Whereas a buoyant object (on a properly working scale for weighing buoyant objects) would weigh less, the object / fluid system  becomes heavier by the value of object's full mass once the object is added. For instance, buoyancy's diminishing effect upon one's body weight (a relatively low-density object) is 1⁄860 that of gravity (for pure water it is about 1⁄770 that of gravity). It can be expressed in terms of the equation  Submerged specific gravity is equal to the specific gravity given by the ratio of the weight of the object to the weight of the fluid) minus one. That is, the object and fluid have the same density when the specific gravity equals one and the submerged specific gravity equals zero. This fact highlights the utility of the usage of submerged specific gravity in problems involving buoyancy and force balances on submerged objects: the object will naturally rise when its submerged specific gravity is negative, and sink when its submerged specific gravity is positive.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

At an angle greater than the critical angle (when the incident beam is nearly parallel to the interface) the light will be completely reflected within the first medium, a condition known as total internal reflection. In the case of PSTM, the first medium is a prism, typically made of glass, and the second medium is the air above the prism. When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (like the cornea) to a medium with a lower refractive index (like air), it can undergo total internal reflection under certain conditions. When the angle of incidence of light hitting the cornea from the air exceeds 46 degrees, the light is completely reflected back into the cornea rather than being refracted out into the air. The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such \n\nThe critical angle of the cornea-air interface is a specific angle at which light undergoes total internal reflection instead of refraction when passing from the cornea to the air. When the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, the light is completely reflected back into the original medium instead of being transmitted through it. This angle represents the threshold at which light rays entering the cornea from the air at a steeper angle will be reflected back into the cornea, rather than bending and continuing through the cornea. The back focal plane (also called “aperture plane”) is the plane through which the excitatory beam is focused before passing through the objective. Adjusting the distance between the objective and BPF can yield different imaging magnification, as the incident angle will become less or more steep. The beam must also be focused at the BPF because this ensures that the light passing through the objective is collimated, interacting with the cover slip at the same angle and thus all totally internally reflecting.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

The voltage induced is determined by:  \n\nNo matter how the change is produced, a voltage will be generated.When a wire is used as an example of a conductor, Faraday's law basically states that any change in the magnetic environment of the coil of wire with time will cause a voltage to be induced in the wire.At the cell membrane level, free radicals of nitric oxide may play an essential role in this regulation of receptors specifically (Adey, 1988, 1992, 2004). Faraday's law (1831) defines the fundamental relationship between a changing magnetic field and a conductor (any medium that carries electrically charged particles). When a wire is used as an example of a conductor, Faraday's law basically states that any change in the magnetic environment of the coil of wire with time will cause a voltage to be induced in the wire. No matter how the change is produced, a voltage will be generated.Lenz's law states that the polarity of the voltage induced according to Faraday's law is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the applied magnetic field (back EMF, or electromagnetic field). In other words, the emf generated is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. The effects described by this law are those by which generators, motors, alternators, and transformers function. There are two main concepts to be taken from Faraday's Law that apply to the design of inductive discharge ignitions. One is that moving a wire through a magnetic field will induce an electric voltage and current in the wire, aka electromagnetic induction. The second is that current moving in a wire will induce a magnetic field around the wire. spinning a wire loop into a fixed magnetic field), ; 4) any combination of the above  Faraday's law of induction makes use of the magnetic flux ΦB through a region of space enclosed by a wire loop. The more turns of wire, the stronger the field produced. Conversely, a changing external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to Faraday's law of induction. The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

The higher the photon's frequency, the higher its energy. Equivalently, the longer the photon's wavelength, the lower its energy. E is photon energy (Joules), ; λ is the photon's wavelength (metres), ; c is the speed of light in vacuum - 299792458 metres per second ; h is the Planck constant - 6.62607015 × 10−34 (m2kgs−1) Photon energy is directly proportional to frequency. Therefore, when the frequency of light increases, the energy of the corresponding photon also increases. This relationship can be explained using the equation E = hν, where E represents the energy of a photon and h is Planck's constant. According to this equation, the energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. Consequently, higher frequency light (e.g., blue or violet light) carries photons with greater energy, while lower frequency light (e.g., red or infrared light) carries photons with lesser energy. For instance, violet light with a wavelength of around 400 nm has a higher frequency compared to red light with a wavelength of about 680 nm. As a result, the photons in violet light possess higher energy than those in red light. At 400 nm (violet light), the energy of a mole of photons can be computed using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J·s), c is the speed of light (3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength in meters. In summary, the frequency of light directly determines the energy of a photon. An increase in frequency leads to higher energy photons, while a decrease in frequency results in lower energy photons. This relationship is described by the equation E = hν, where E is the energy of a photon, h is Planck's constant, and ν is the frequency of light.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of geodesics. As a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit gravitational waves, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like many other aspects of relativity) has been experimentally confirmed by astronomers—most dramatically in the direct detection of gravitational waves originating from a black hole merger when they passed through LIGO in 2015. The term \"theory of relativity\" refers to two theories formulated by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. On the other hand, general relativity, presented by Einstein in 1915, extends the principles of special relativity to include gravitational forces. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other.

Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin-orbit coupling, which is an \n\n1) A solid, liquid, or dense gas excited to emit light will radiate at all wavelengths and thus produce a continuous spectrum. ; 2) A low-density gas excited to emit light will do so at specific wavelengths and this produces an emission spectrum. ; 3) If light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, the result will be an absorption spectrum. The existence of discrete spectral lines was known since Fraunhofer discovered them in 1814. But these discrete spectral lines were not explained as electron transitions until the Bohr model of the atom in 1913, which helped lead to quantum mechanics. Radiative excitation by absorption of continuum radiation: In this process, the X-ray emission is produced by the absorption of continuum radiation, which excites the ions and elements in the gas. Inner shell fluorescence: Inner shell fluorescence occurs when high-energy X-rays or electrons ionize the inner shells of atoms, causing the outer-shell electrons to transition to lower energy levels. These transitions result in the emission of characteristic X-ray lines. declaring that there was no state below this), and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines. After Bohr's use of Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the emission and absorption spectra of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. Every chemical element has absorption lines at particular wavelengths, which correspond to the differences between the energy levels of its atomic orbitals. When light passes through a gas or liquid containing these elements, certain wavelengths are absorbed, resulting in dark lines or bands in the spectrum.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

It is a visual depiction of the characteristic wave that shows how the wave changes over time. The waveform can have several characteristics, including amplitude, frequency, wavelength, and phase. Amplitude refers to the maximum displacement or height of the wave. In a waveform, the amplitude is represented along the vertical axis. Frequency refers to the number of complete cycles of the wave that occur in a given time period. It is measured in hertz (Hz) and represents the rate at which the wave oscillates. In a waveform, the wavelength can be seen as the distance between repeating patterns. Graphically, these characteristics are represented by plotting the waveform on a graph. By analyzing the shape of the waveform, we can derive valuable information about the characteristics of the wave, such as its frequency, amplitude, and phase. As a result, the momentum flux (the rate of momentum transfer per unit area and unit time) generates a current. These surface currents are able to transport energy (e.g. The different processes described here are depicted in the sketches shown in figures 1.1 till 1.4. Interactions between wind, wind waves and currents are an essential part of the world ocean dynamics. At this point, simple physical models that describe wave dynamics often become invalid, particularly those that assume linear behaviour.

This theory only considers the steric effect, which is a short-range interaction that occurs when the chains on different particles interpenetrate each other. However, in the case of colloidal particles with hairy surfaces, the extended chains constrain the orientation of water molecules near the surface, resulting in a difference in the dielectric constant compared to the bulk. from an external generator. The current through a recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge; in other words, the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging. The common convention is to name the electrode of a battery that releases electrons during discharge as the anode or the negative (-) electrode and the electrode that absorbs the electrons as the cathode or the positive (+). This change in the molecular dipoles is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in dielectric losses (see dissipation factor). When the capacitor is discharging, the strength of the electric field is decreasing and the common orientation of the molecular dipoles \n\n As another example from physics, consider a parallel-plate capacitor, in which the plates can move relative to one another.

Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and warms it. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the \n\nThe greenhouse effect refers to the process in which the atmosphere of a planet, including Earth, traps and re-emits infrared radiation, resulting in the warming of the planet's surface. However, due to the presence of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O), the average surface temperature is about 14 °C (57 °F). These greenhouse gases act like a blanket around Earth, allowing sunlight to pass through but trapping some of the heat radiated from the surface. This enhanced greenhouse effect has contributed to global warming, which is characterized by a recent increase in Earth's lower atmospheric temperatures. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit infrared radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space. While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks.

In the long run, Earth radiates the same amount of energy per second as it absorbs, because the amount of thermal radiation emitted depends upon temperature: If Earth absorbs more energy per second than it radiates, Earth heats up and the thermal radiation will increase, until balance is restored; if Earth absorbs less energy than it radiates, it cools down and the thermal radiation will decrease, again until balance is restored. Atmospheric CO2 absorbs some of the energy radiated by the ground, but it emits itself thermal radiation: For example, in some wavelengths\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current out of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor. For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to charge rather than discharge. The formula is a combination of Ohm's law and Joule's law: where: A linear resistor has a constant resistance value over all applied voltages or currents; many practical resistors are linear over a useful range of currents. Where alternating current is applied to the circuit (or where the resistance value is a function of time), the relation above is true at any instant but calculation of average power over an interval of time requires integration of \"instantaneous\" power over that interval. ; The current in typical electric circuits is confined to the circuit, with very little \"leakage\". It represents the amount of force or pressure that pushes the electric charge through the circuit. It is the rate at which electrons pass through a specific point in a circuit. It determines how much current will flow in a circuit for a given voltage. Higher resistance restricts the flow of electrons, while lower resistance allows more current to flow. Therefore, in summary, the relationship between voltage, current, resistance, and power in an electric circuit is described by Ohm's Law, which states that voltage is equal to the current multiplied by the resistance.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

The rumor stated that various gangs across the United States carry out an initiation wherein the initiate drives around at night with his headlights off. In North Dakota, when an oncoming vehicle is within 500 feet, high-beam flashing for any length of time (including momentary flashes) and for any purpose at night is illegal under N.D.C.C. In Ohio, courts have held that the act of flashing one's headlights so as to alert oncoming drivers of a radar trap does not constitute the offense of obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties, where there was no proof that the warned vehicles were speeding prior to the warning. In 1999, The Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division held that a statute limiting how far high beams may project is not violated when a motorist flashes his or her high beams to warn oncoming motorists of radar. New York Vehicle and Traffic \n\n Alaska, a State Trooper has been found to have probable cause to stop a driver who flashes both a vehicle's high beams and his \"moose lights\" based upon a violation of 13 AAC 04.020(e)(1). Some drivers attempt to communicate \"I will continue my current behavior!\" For example, if such a driver flashes his or her headlights while slowing down, they intend to communicate to another driver who is waiting to merge in traffic: \"Go on, I will let you merge!\" On the other hand, if such a driver keeps his or her current speed and flashes headlights, they intend to communicate \"Stay back, I am not slowing down!\" Motorcycle headlamp modulators automatically oscillate the intensity of the headlamp in an effort to make the motorcycle more conspicuous to other drivers.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

The weight of the bowling ball on the Moon would be one-sixth of that on the Earth, although its mass remains unchanged. Consequently, whenever the physics of recoil kinetics (mass, velocity, inertia, inelastic and elastic collisions) dominate and the influence of gravity is a negligible factor, the behavior of objects remains consistent even where gravity is relatively weak. For instance, billiard balls on a billiard table would scatter and recoil with the same speeds and energies after a break shot on the Moon as on Earth; they would, however, drop into the pockets much more slowly. The rink has rounded corners (1 m radius) and is surrounded by a 1 m wall. First let's see why normal force can point down in the first place. In the first diagram, let's say the object is a person sitting inside a plane, the two forces point down only when it reaches the top of the circle. The reason for this is that the normal force is the sum of the tangential force and centripetal force.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) together with a high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive. Characteristics can be sorted to infer subaqueous eruption or emplacement of silicic pyroclastic deposits. Larger pumice blocks rise for a more extended period of time (minutes to hours) in comparison to smaller pumice fragments because of gases trapped within vesicles and the very fine ash fragments may become entrained into the rising plume of gas and heated water because of the low density and weight. Therefore, subaqueous silicic pyroclastic eruptions may be diminished in the course size fraction as well as the very fine \n\n There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish plutonic from volcanic rock. For example, the alkali feldspar in plutonic rocks is typically orthoclase, while the higher-temperature polymorph, sanidine, is more common in volcanic rock. Leucite is common in lavas but very rare in plutonic rocks. In fact, many of them are petrologically indistinguishable from lavas of similar composition. Pyroclastic materials, such as pumice, scoria, and ashes are formed from cooling magma during explosive volcanic eruptions. For example, pumice and other volcanic glasses were added as a natural pozzolanic material for mortars and plasters during the construction of the Villa San Marco in the Roman period (89 B.C. ocean in pumice rafts.

It the symbolic color of the heart and the red rose, is closely associated with romantic love or courtly love and Saint Valentine's Day. Both the Greeks and the Hebrews considered red a symbol of love as well as sacrifice. The Roman de la Rose, the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific language of flowers – giving a single red rose meant \n\n A chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its color. The color that is seen by our eyes is the one not absorbed by the reflecting object within a certain wavelength spectrum of visible light. The visual pigments in the cone outer segments contain different opsins, which allow them to absorb light at different wavelengths. The three types of cones have maximum absorption efficiency closer to violet, green, and yellow wavelengths, although they are referred to as blue, green, and red pigments, respectively. For example, if the cones that respond to red and green light are stimulated at the same time, our brain interprets it as yellow. Similarly, a mixture of red and blue light is interpreted as magenta. It's important to note that the amount of light absorbed by each cone and the subsequent response of the cell depend on both the wavelength and the intensity of the light. The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power chemical reactions, while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the color the pigment will appear to the eye. ; The reddish color of the Sun when it is observed through a thick atmosphere, as during a sunrise or sunset.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

This overlay of all the waves produces a shock wave which for sound waves is known as a sonic boom. In acoustics, the sound speed gradient is the rate of change of the speed of sound with distance, for example with depth in the ocean, or height in the Earth's atmosphere. A sound speed gradient leads to refraction of sound wavefronts in the direction of lower sound speed, causing the sound rays to follow a curved path. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the gradient. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. ; When using a microwave oven to cook food, the micro wave travels through the food, causing the water molecules vibrate in the same frequency, which is similar to resonance, so that the food as a whole, gets hot fast. ; Some of the helicopter crashes are caused by resonance too. The eyeballs of the pilot resonate because of excessive pressure in the upper air, making the pilot unable to see overhead power lines. ; Resonance of two identical tune forks See video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCocQa2Bcuc\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity the wave travels at in the medium depends on the acoustic properties of the medium, which include its density, elasticity, and compressibility.The energy loss heats the medium.As the magnitude of the wave decreases, the energy is absorbed by the medium.16.1, the sound frequency is shown by the oscillating wave.As shown in Fig.High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) procedures are used to treat cancer patients. Sound is mechanical energy that travels as pressure waves through a medium. This is above audible sound that has frequencies of 2–20,000 Hz. A mechanical siren generates sound by spinning a slotted chopper wheel to interrupt a stream of air at a regular rate. Modern sirens can develop a sound level of up to 135 decibels at 100 ft. The Chrysler air raid siren, driven by a 331 cuin Chrysler Hemi gasoline engine, generates 138 dB at 100 ft. By use of varying tones or binary patterns of sound, different alert conditions can be signaled. Electronic sirens can transmit voice announcements in addition to alert tone signals.

However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread \n\n becomes partially deflated, it often becomes neutrally buoyant and can float about the house a meter or two off the floor. In such a state, there are moments when the balloon is neither rising nor falling and—in the sense that a scale placed under it has no force applied to it—is, in a sense perfectly weightless (actually as noted below, weight has merely been redistributed along the Earth's surface so it cannot be measured). Though the rubber comprising the balloon has a mass of only a few grams, which might be almost unnoticeable, the rubber still retains all its mass when \n\nBoyle's law states that the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional to each other, as long as the temperature and number of gas molecules remain constant. Conversely, when the volume of the system increases, there is more space for the gas molecules to spread out. is required to counter their weight when they are hovering over the ground (when they can often be within one hundred newtons of zero weight), the inertia associated with their appreciable mass of several hundred kilograms or more can knock fully grown men off their feet when the balloon's basket is moving horizontally over the ground. Buoyancy and the resultant reduction in the downward force of objects being weighed underlies Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. Whereas a buoyant object (on a properly working scale for weighing buoyant objects) would weigh less, the object / fluid system  becomes heavier by the value of object's full mass once the object is added. Since air is a fluid, this principle applies to object / air systems as well; large volumes of air—and ultimately the ground—supports the weight a body loses through mid-air buoyancy. The effects of buoyancy do not just affect balloons; both liquids and gases are fluids in the physical sciences, and when all macrosize objects larger than dust particles\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.

Light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization (e.g., by passage through a crystal lamina, or by total internal reflection) was described as partly or fully \"depolarized\" because of its behavior in an analyzer. After Fresnel, the defining feature of polarized light was that the perpendicular components of vibration had a fixed ratio of amplitudes and a fixed difference in phase. By that definition, elliptically or circularly polarized light is fully polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone. In a memoir dated 9 December 1822, Fresnel coined the terms linear polarization (French: polarisation rectiligne) for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or 180° out of phase, circular polarization for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter-cycle (±90°) out of phase, and elliptical polarization for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference. If these \n\n The second meaning of dichroic refers to the property of a material, in which light in different polarization states traveling through it experiences a different absorption coefficient; this is also known as diattenuation. When light propagates in the material, interaction with the magnetic field causes left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves to propagate with slightly different phase velocities. Since a linearly-polarized wave can be described as a superposition of left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves, the difference in phase velocity causes the polarization direction of a linearly-polarized wave to rotate as it propagates through the material. propagated at slightly different speeds, the phase difference between them – and therefore the direction of their linearly-polarized resultant – would vary continuously with distance. Hence it was thought that the degree of polarization was the degree to which the light could be suppressed\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about conceptual physics.
