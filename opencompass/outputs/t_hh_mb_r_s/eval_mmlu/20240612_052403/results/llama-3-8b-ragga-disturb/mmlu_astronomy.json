Within a few seconds of initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a runaway reaction, releasing enough energy (1–200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 J) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion. The type Ia category of supernova produces a fairly consistent peak luminosity because of this fixed critical mass at which a white dwarf will explode. Their consistent peak luminosity allows these explosions to be used as standard candles to measure the distance to their host galaxies: the visual magnitude of a type Ia supernova, as observed from Earth, indicates its distance from Earth.

The scale is reverse logarithmic: the brighter an object is, the lower its magnitude number. A difference of \n\n apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in photometry over various wavelength bands. With the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. This gives \n\n In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light-years, 308.57 petameters or 308.57 trillion kilometres).

This is caused by the scattering and absorption of blue light by the Earth's atmosphere. However, on rare occasions, dust or smoke aerosols in the atmosphere can cause the extinction of red light to exceed that of blue light. This is because the dust particles in the Martian atmosphere primarily scatter blue light in a near-forward direction, resulting in the blue coloration of the sunset. This phenomenon cannot be solely explained by Rayleigh scattering, as observed on Earth. In summary, the blue appearance of the sun and moon on rare occasions is a result of the selective extinction of light, with blue light being scattered and absorbed differently by atmospheric particles. Similarly, the blue sunsets on Mars are caused by the scattering of blue light in the Martian atmosphere by dust aerosols. Around sunset and sunrise, the sky is rose in color, but in the vicinity of the setting Sun it is blue. On Mars, Rayleigh scattering is usually a very weak effect; the red color of the sky is caused by the presence of iron(III) oxide in the airborne dust particles. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light is composed of the shorter wavelengths of blue and violet. This is the main reason why the ocean is blue. Light from the sky is a result of the Rayleigh scattering of sunlight, which results in a blue color perceived by the human eye. On a sunny day, Rayleigh scattering gives the sky a blue gradient, where it is darkest around the zenith and bright near the horizon. Hence, fewer particles scatter the zenithal sunbeam, and thus the light remains a darker blue. This results in \n\nThe blue color of the sky. ; The reddish color of the Sun when it is observed through a thick atmosphere, as during a sunrise or sunset.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

This work was furthered by ancient Indian and medieval Islamic physicists, before gaining great strides during the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution, culminating in the formulation of Newton's law of gravity. This was superseded by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in the early 20th century. Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner gravitas (heaviness). In the 6th century CE, Byzantine Alexandrian scholar John Philoponus modified the Aristotelian concept of gravity with the theory of impetus. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a Euclidean geometry.) From a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other \n\n is equal to the g-force plus the non-gravitational external forces on the slice, if any (counted positive in the direction opposite to the g-force).

These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects moving at constant speeds relative to each other. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. - The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to emphasize how special relativity (and later general relativity) uses the principle of rela\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

Titan's lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (94.2%), methane (5.65%), and hydrogen (0.099%). Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only known moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere. Titan, on the other hand, is only planetary body besides Earth with liquid hydrocarbons on its surface. Furthermore, Mars has an atmosphere containing abundant amounts of carbon and nitrogen, both essential elements needed for life. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt to the surface of the moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be \"as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea\". On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.

The mass of the comet is estimated to be about 300 Mt. Barring a catastrophic breakup or major splitting event, the comet should be able to survive up to another 100 apparitions (~700 years) at its current rate of mass loss. Radar observations by the Arecibo Observatory during the comet's 2010 apparition revealed that the nucleus is highly elongated and rotates over an 18-hour period.

Michael A'Hearn, the science team leader for the EPOXI mission, stated \"Early observations of the comet show that, for the first time, we may be able to connect activity to individual features on the nucleus\". \"When warmed by the Sun, dry ice [frozen carbon dioxide] deep in the comet's body turns to gas jetting off the comet and dragging water ice with it.\" It is now believed that some of the dust, icy chunks, and other material coming off the ends of the comet are moving slowly enough to be captured by even the weak gravity of the comet.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

A study of dust storms with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter suggested that 10 percent of the water loss from Mars may have been caused by dust storms. Instruments on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected observed water vapor at very high altitudes during global dust storms. The most recent loss of atomic hydrogen from water was found to be largely driven by seasonal processes and dust storms that transport water directly to the upper atmosphere. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. The volume of water ice in the region were based on measurements from the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, called SHARAD. ,\n\nRecent findings about Martian water, methane, and organics have had a significant impact on the case for the existence of life on Mars. The Viking Labeled Release (LR) experiment conducted in 1976 yielded positive responses for extant microbial life on the Martian surface. Evidence suggests that liquid water existed on the Martian surface in the past and may still exist in the form of briny water today. In terms of methane, which is another important factor in the search for life, recent observations have detected the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere. The detection of methane on Mars has sparked interest and debate as to its origin, with one possibility being the existence of microbial life beneath the Martian surface. Furthermore, the discovery of organic compounds on Mars has also contributed to the discussion. It is important to note that the existence of water, methane, and organics on Mars does not confirm the presence of life conclusively. Overall, recent findings regarding Martian water, methane, and organics provide strong indications that life on Mars is a possibility. While the Viking LR experiment remains controversial and its results are debated, the presence of these key elements necessary for life increases the likelihood of extant or past life on Mars. Much of the Martian surface is covered with a thick ice-rich, mantle layer that has fallen from the sky a number of times in the past. High levels of hydrogen (probably from water) have been found with Mars Odyssey. The Phoenix Lander found water ice directly since it landed in a field of polygons and its landing rockets exposed a pure ice surface. This cracking of ice-rich ground is predicted based on physical processes. ,\n\n Hundreds of gullies were discovered that were formed from liquid water, possibly in recent times. On 6 December 2006 NASA released photos of two craters in Terra Sirenum and Centauri Montes which appear to show the presence of flowing water on Mars at some point between 1999 and 2001.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

At the time the first meteorite from the Moon was discovered in 1982, there was speculation that some other unusual meteorites that had been found previously originated from Mars. This would be very interesting because in this case stones from Earth older than 3.9 billion years, which are destroyed on Earth by various geological processes, may have survived on the Moon. Thus some scientists propose new missions to the Moon to search for ancient rocks from Earth. The smaller moon may have remained in orbit for tens of millions of years. As the two moons migrated outward from Earth, solar tidal effects would have made the Lagrange orbit unstable, resulting in a slow-velocity collision that \"pancaked\" the smaller moon onto what is now the far side of the Moon, adding material to its crust. Lunar magma cannot pierce through the thick crust of the far side, causing fewer lunar maria, while the near side has a thin crust displaying the large maria visible from Earth. Granite and quartz, which are commonly found on Earth but very rarely found on the Moon, were confirmed to exist on Big Bertha. Meteoroid collisions with solid Solar System objects, including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede, and most small moons and asteroids, create impact craters, which are the dominant geographic features of many of those objects. On other planets and moons with active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io, and Titan, visible impact craters may become eroded, buried, or transformed by tectonics over time. The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites (Mercury and Venus), or only relatively tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids (Mars). The Moon is also the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, being 27% the size of Earth.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

If Earth's orbit sends it through that trail of debris, which is composed mostly of fine grains of rocky material, there is likely to be a meteor shower as Earth passes through. Denser trails of debris produce quick but intense meteor showers and less dense trails create longer but less intense showers. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Because meteors are not predictable with the same degree of accuracy as planets, stars, or man-made objects such as satellites, these occurrences are more difficult to prove in retrospect, though UFO sightings during meteor showers, or where there are astronomical reports of bolides, are likely to be explained as such. The meteors we currently see as members of the Eta Aquariid shower separated from Halley's Comet hundreds of years ago. Meteors may occur in showers, which arise when Earth passes through a stream of debris left by a comet, or as \"random\" or \"sporadic\" meteors, not associated with a specific stream of space debris.

Once the particles have been ionised, they form a plasma which in turn induces a magnetosphere around the comet. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called \"pick-up ions\") congregate and act to \"load\" the solar magnetic field with plasma. Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an \"induced magnetosphere\" around the comet. Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a bow shock is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called \"pick-up ions\") congregate and act to \"load\" the solar magnetic field with plasma, such that the field lines \"drape\" around the comet forming the ion \n\nThe high temperatures and strong magnetic fields of the solar corona play a crucial role in the formation of streams of solar wind that expand through the Solar System into interstellar space. These conditions create an environment where charged particles, mainly protons and electrons, gain high energies and are able to escape the gravitational pull of the Sun. The high temperatures in the solar corona, reaching millions of degrees Celsius, result from the intense heating caused by the conversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy. The strong magnetic fields in the corona also contribute to the formation of solar wind. As the magnetic field lines extend outward from the Sun's surface, they create a magnetic pressure that dominates both ion and electron pressure. In summary, the high temperatures and strong magnetic fields in the solar corona contribute to the formation of solar wind by providing the energy and pressure needed for particles to escape the Sun's gravitational pull. This solar wind then expands through the Solar System, carrying charged particles and magnetic field lines with it into interstellar space. Rather than air, the solar wind is a stream of charged particles—a plasma—ejected from the upper atmosphere of the sun at a rate of 400 km/s. These particles are able to escape the Sun's gravity, in part because of the high temperature of the corona, but also because of high kinetic energy that particles gain through a process that is not well understood. The tail of dust is left behind in the comet's orbit in such a manner that it often forms a curved tail called the antitail, only when it seems that it is directed towards the Sun. At the same time, the ion tail, made of gases, always points along the streamlines of the solar wind as it is strongly affected by the magnetic field of the plasma of the solar wind.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

The length that Eratosthenes intended for a 'stade' is not known, but his figure only has an error of around one to fifteen percent. Eratosthenes could only measure the circumference of Earth by assuming that the distance to the Sun is so great that the rays of sunlight are practically parallel. Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled On the measure of the Earth, which has not been preserved. Eratosthenes' method to calculate the Earth's circumference has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by Cleomedes to popularise the discovery. Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, Alexandria and Syene, modern Assuan: Under the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by \n\n a vertical rod (a gnomon) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground; it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays, which he claims to be about 7°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Eratosthenes' method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose \n\n Under the assumption that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer Eratosthenes performed an experiment using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of Earth.

The Small Magellanic Cloud would be about magnitude 0.6, substantially brighter than the LMC appears to us. As the stars traveled away, they went into normal stellar evolution, with one of them becoming a red giant and engulfing the other and forming one giant star &mdash; a blue straggler. In 2008, a team of astronomers found a match between the star's chemical composition and the characteristics of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Later observations using the Hubble Space Telescope showed that the star originated from the Milky Way's galactic center. the possibility that the star came from the Large Magellanic Cloud, but was consistent with the hypothesis that it was ejected from the center of the Milky Way. NGC 1755 (also known as ESO 56-SC28) is an open star cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud in the Dorado constellation, It is about 120 light years across and due to its size could be a globular cluster.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about astronomy.

In 2012, The Lyman Alpha Mapping Project aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has found that the permanently shadowed regions have a porous, powdery surface, that indicates the presence of water ice. \"When warmed by the Sun, dry ice [frozen carbon dioxide] deep in the comet's body turns to gas jetting off the comet and dragging water ice with it.\" It is now believed that some of the dust, icy chunks, and other material coming off the ends of the comet are moving slowly enough to be captured by even the weak gravity of the comet. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe &ndash; the Phoebe ring.

The crater was referred to as e5 in scientific literature prior to naming. S band radar data from the Arecibo Observatory collected between 1999 and 2005 indicates a radar-bright area along the southern interior of Vonnegut, which is probably indicative of a water ice deposit, and lies within the permanently shadowed part of the crater.

It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. Voids are affected by the way gravity causes matter in the universe to \"clump together\", herding galaxies into clusters and chains, which are separated by regions mostly devoid of galaxies, yet the exact mechanisms are subject to scientific debate.
