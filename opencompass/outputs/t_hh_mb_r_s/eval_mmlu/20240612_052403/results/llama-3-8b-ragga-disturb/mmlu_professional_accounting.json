When all the audit procedures that are considered necessary, either by circumstances, engagement, or client limitation, the audit is limited in scope. Auditing standards suggest that when restrictions imposed by the client significantly limit the scope of the engagement the auditor should consider disclaiming the opinion. Some scope limitations arise for reasons that are beyond the control of the client, such as fire and flood. Alternative procedures can overcome the risk of the auditor's qualified or disclaimer opinion. Simple procedures to provide sufficient evidence would be necessary for the auditor to adhere to US GAAP. If the organization elects to only inspect a fraction of units produced, the sample size should be chosen large enough so that the chance of finding at least one nonconforming unit in a sample is high—otherwise the false alarm rate is too high. Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff, and in the context of accounting it is the \"unbiased examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization\". Audit is a professional service that is systematic and conventional. Risk-based auditing is a style of auditing which focuses upon the analysis and management of risk. This then encouraged the audit activity of studying these risks rather than just checking compliance with existing controls. A traditional audit would focus upon the transactions which would make up financial statements such as the balance sheet. An experiment suggested that managers might respond to risk-based auditing by transferring activity to accounts which are ostensibly low risk. Auditors would need to anticipate such attempts to game the process. Inaccurate matching can be caused by various factors, such as differences in data collection methods or errors in data entry. These errors can be due to factors like nonresponse bias, coverage errors, or measurement errors. Nonresponse bias occurs when individuals or households selected for the survey do not respond, and this can introduce bias into the estimates. Coverage errors arise from the undercoverage or overcoverage of certain population groups.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about professional accounting.

The Company is the Lipid Management Company, a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing complementary, convenient, cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and the Company expects to report top-line results in August 2018. The global pivotal Phase 3 clinical development program for bempedoic acid, consisting of four clinical studies, is substantially complete with approximately 3,600 high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are high CVD risk primary prevention, on optimized background lipid-modifying therapy and with elevated levels of LDL-C. The Company expects to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. The Company intends to use positive results from the Phase 3 bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid programs with a total of 4,000 patients to support global regulatory submissions for tandem LDL-C lowering indications in the U.S. no later than the first quarter of 2019 and in Europe no later than the second quarter of 2019. The Company is also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT)known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. The Company initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expects the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intends to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. The Companys primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development activities, including nonclinical, preclinical and clinical testing, performing business and financial planning, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company has not commenced principal operations and is subject to risks and uncertainties which include the need to research, develop, and clinically test potential therapeutic products; obtain regulatory approvals for its products and commercialize them, if approved; expand its management and scientific staff; and finance its operations with an ultimate goal of achieving profitable operations. The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such losses to continue over the foreseeable future. Management plans to continue to fund operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. If adequate funds are not available, the Company may not be able to continue the development of its current or future product candidates, or to commercialize its current or future product candidates, if approved. In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01 which includes provisions to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by the Company without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact to the Companys balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact to the Companys balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. In June 2014, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Oxford Finance LLC which provided for initial borrowings of $5.0 million under the term loan (the Term A Loan). On June 30, 2014, the Company received proceeds of $5.0 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under the Term A Loan. The secured promissory notes issued under the Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate of 6.40% and are due on July 1, 2018. In connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19 (see Note 4). The warrant resulted in a debt discount of $0.1 million which is amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the Term A Loan. In addition, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.1 million in connection with the borrowing of the Term A Loan. The debt issuance costs were capitalized and included in long-term debt on the balance sheet at the inception of the Term A Loan, and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the same term. In connection with the Credit Facility entered into in June 2014, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 8,230 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $15.19. The warrant was recorded at fair value of $0.1 million to additional-paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-10 based upon the allocation of the debt proceeds. Upon the closing of the Companys Initial Public Offering, all warrants exercisable for 1,940,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (unadjusted for stock splits), were automatically converted into warrants exercisable for 277,690 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $6.99 per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the remaining 177,123 warrants were net exercised for 159,944 shares of the Companys common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 71,237 warrants were net exercised for 62,525 shares of the Companys common stock. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for a total of 8,230 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $15.19 per share. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against the Company, Tim Mayleben, and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that the Company, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that the Company announced on May 2, 2018. The amended lease is to increase the current 7,941 rentable square feet of office space by 11,471 rentable square feet, together with the right to use common areas and facilities in common with the landlord and other tenants. The term of the lease commences with respect to all of the space in the leased premises on the later to occur of (i) the date upon which landlord delivers the premises to the Company under the terms of the lease with the delivery conditions set forth in the lease satisfied and (ii) November 1, 2018 (the Lease Commencement Date). The term of the lease shall end 60 months after the Lease Commencement Date. Under the terms of the lease, following the first month (during which the base rent is $0) and the second month (during which the base rent is $15,990), the base rent, subject to certain adjustments, for the leased premises will start at approximately $19,412 per month, plus certain operating expenses and taxes, and shall increase on an annual basis and/or as otherwise provided in the lease agreement. At June 30, 2018, remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as current on the balance sheets were less than 12 months and remaining contractual maturities of investments classified as long-term were less than two years. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on investments of $0.7 million and $1.5 million, and income for the accretion of premiums and discounts on investments of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, other income, net in the statements of operations includes interest income on available-for-sale investments of $0.4 million and $1.0 million, and expense for the amortization of premiums and discounts on investments of approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and require the reporting entity to develop assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2017 Plan was set to 750,000, with any shares of common stock that are forfeited, cancelled, held back upon the exercise or settlement of an award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of common stock, or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) under the 2017 Plan added back to the shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. and available for issuance under the 2013 Plan will be cumulatively increased by 2.5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser number of shares of common stock determined by the compensation committee. The Company incurs stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs. The fair value of RSUs is determined by the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation. In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $5.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to stock options. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company recognized $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recognized $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense recognized related to RSUs. As of June 30, 2018, there was $2.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, warrants for common stock, stock options and unvested RSUs are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events, including our clinical development plans, or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, including in relation to the clinical development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, those referred to or discussed in or incorporated by reference into the section titled Risk Factors included in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. The clinical development program for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill consists of a single pivotal Phase 3 study (1002FDC-053) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HeFH, including high CVD risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled despite receiving maximally tolerated lipid-modifying background therapy. 1002FDC-053 initiated in November 2017 and fully enrolled 382 patients in March 2018, and we expect to report top-line results in August 2018.\nmaximally tolerated statin therapy, and 2) patients who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin, and can be considered statin intolerant. We expect to report top-line results from Study 2 (1002-047) in September 2018. We intend to use positive results from our Phase 3 bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid programs with a total of 4,000 patients to support global regulatory submissions for tandem LDL-C lowering indications in the U.S. no later than the first quarter of 2019 and in Europe no later than the second quarter of 2019. We are also conducting a global cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT,  known as Cholesterol Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes, for bempedoic acid in patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CVD risk and who can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated the CLEAR Outcomes CVOT in December 2016 and expect the study to be fully enrolled in 2019, and intend to use positive results from this CVOT to support submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness, and we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or through other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy or continue operations. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, we incurred $61.0 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT, our 1002FDC-053 study, our open-label extension study, our 1002FDC-058 study and our Phase 2 (1002-39) clinical study of bempedoic acid when added-on to an injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, or PCSK9i, therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we incurred $56.3 million in expenses related to the four studies in our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program, our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT and our Phase 2 (1002-038) clinical study of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination plus atorvastatin with bempedoic acid 180 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The 12-week, pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of four treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral, fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg alone and ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill versus placebo, bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg alone and effects on other risk markers, including hsCRP, non-HDL-C, apoB and total cholesterol. Study 2 is a 52-week global pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg versus placebo in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD and/or HeFH, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 24-week LDL-C lowering efficacy, and 52-week safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo. Initiated in June 2018, the 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-dose study consists of three treatment arms evaluating the efficacy and safety of a once-daily, oral fixed dose combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg versus placebo and versus ezetimibe 10 mg alone. Exploratory objectives include 12-week HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and additional glycemic measurements. Safety data will be obtained from an open-label extension study which completed enrollment of 1,462 of the 2,230 patients enrolled in Study 1 in March 2018. Initiated in February 2017, this open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety of bempedoic acid 180 mg in high CVD risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and with ASCVD and/or HeFH whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies, and who are taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety in patients treated with bempedoic acid for up to 1.5 years. Secondary objectives include evaluating the 52- and 78-week effects of bempedoic acid on lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including LDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, apoB and hsCRP. CLEAR Outcomes is an event driven, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of bempedoic acid in patients with ASCVD and/or HeFH, or who are at high risk for CVD, with hypercholesterolemia and who are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant. We initiated CLEAR Outcomes in December 2016, and the study is intended to support our submissions for a CV risk reduction indication in the U.S. and Europe by 2022. If we fail to complete the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid or any other product candidates and secure approval from regulatory authorities, our ability to generate future revenue and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical studies, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies. Our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. Costs associated with bempedoic acid will increase as we further its clinical development, including in connection with our global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering program and our CLEAR Outcomes CVOT. The duration, costs and timing associated with the development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid will depend on a variety of factors, including uncertainties associated with the results of our clinical studies and our ability to obtain regulatory approval. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical studies beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill or bempedoic acid, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical studies, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development or post-commercialization clinical studies of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, communication expenses and professional fees for legal, patent prosecution, protection and review, consulting and accounting services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in connection with the continued research and development and commercialization of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, increases in our headcount, expansion of our information technology infrastructure, and increased expenses associated with being a public company and complying with exchange listing and Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, requirements. Other income, net, primarily relates to interest income and the amortization of premiums and discounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, and also includes interest expense associated with our credit facility and non-cash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related debt discount, deferred issuance costs and final payment fee. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The updated guidance requires equity investments with determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income. Prospectively, unrealized gains or losses from equity investments with readily determinable fair values will be reflected in earnings through Other income, net on the statement of operations and any equity investments owned by us without readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment determined to be other than temporary. Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2018, were $39.5 million, compared to $38.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.3 million. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily related to clinical development costs for the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the three months ended June 30, 2018, was $0.8 million, compared to $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. bempedoic acid, including costs to support the completion of three global pivotal Phase 3 studies during the period, the ongoing CLEAR CVOT, and increases in our headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Other income, net for the six months ended June 30, 2018, was $1.5 million, compared to $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. We have funded our operations to date primarily through proceeds from sales of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and warrants, public offerings of common stock and the incurrence of indebtedness. In June 2014, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the credit facility) with Oxford Finance LLC whereby we received net proceeds of $4.9 million from the issuance of secured promissory notes under a term loan as part of the facility. In August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 3,100,000 shares of common stock. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 465,000 additional shares of our common stock, which was exercised in full in September 2017. We invest our cash equivalents and investments in highly liquid, interest-bearing investment-grade and government securities to preserve principal. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in the areas of research and development, regulatory and other clinical study costs, associated with the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid and our operations. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $82.4 million and $60.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The primary use of our cash was to fund the development of the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid, adjusted for non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital. Net cash provided by investing activities of $61.9 million and $43.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale and maturities of highly liquid, interest bearing investment-grade and government securities. Net cash provided by financing activities of $10.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, related primarily to proceeds from exercise of our common stock options. Net cash used in financing activities of $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, related primarily to payments on our credit facility. · the implementation of operational and financial information technology. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical partners or royalty-based financing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or royalty-based financing arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market the bempedoic acid / ezetimibe combination pill and bempedoic acid that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We had cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of approximately $24.4 million and $177.4 million at June 30, 2018, and $34.5 million and $239.2 million at December 31, 2017, respectively. Our primary exposure to market risk relates to fluctuations in interest rates which are affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. On May 7, 2018, a purported stockholder of our company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us, Tim Mayleben and Richard Bartram, captioned Kevin Bailey v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. The lawsuit alleges that we, Mr. Mayleben and Mr. Bartram violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly making false and misleading statements about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Phase 3 trial results for bempedoic acid that we announced on May 2, 2018. Except for the historical information contained herein or incorporated by reference, this report and the information incorporated by reference contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the following section, as well as those discussed in Part I, Item 2 entitled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere throughout this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference. You should consider carefully the following risk factors, together with those set forth in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and in all of the other information included or incorporated in this report. The following risk factors represent new risk factors or those containing changes, including material changes, to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. If any of the previously identified or following risks, either alone or taken together, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. The exhibits filed or furnished as part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are set forth on the Exhibit Index, which Exhibit Index is incorporated herein by reference. First Amendment to Valley Ranch Business Park Lease, dated July 6, 2018, between the Registrant and Blackbird Ann Arbor, LLC. + The certification furnished in Exhibit 32.1 hereto is deemed to be furnished with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and will not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Registrant specifically incorporates it by reference. This FIRST AMENDMENT TO LEASE (Amendment) entered into this 6th day of July, 2018, (the Execution Date) by and between ESPERION THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (Tenant), and BLACKBIRD ANN ARBOR, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Landlord), for the purpose of amending the Valley Ranch Business Park Lease, entered into between Landlords predecessor in interest and Tenant dated February 4, 2014 (as amended to date, Lease).

Landlord shall pay Landlords Broker and Tenants Broker a brokers commission as agreed upon pursuant to separate written agreements. With the exception of Tenants Broker, Tenant shall indemnify and forever save and hold Landlord harmless from and against claims for brokerage commissions in connection with this Amendment by any person or party claiming by, through or under Tenant. The Current Premises is the approximately 7,941 RSF grey hatched area. The Expansion Premises is the approximately 11,471 RSF area depicted in white. Scope of Work: Landlord shall perform the work (Landlords Work) in the Expansion Premises as described in the Preliminary Plan attached as Exhibit B-1. Within ten (10) days following the execution of this Amendment, to the extent not already selected, Tenant shall select the finish materials and color selections from Landlords Building standard list to be used in the performance of Landlords Work. Upon finalization of the Working Drawings, Landlords contractor shall diligently prosecute Landlords Work to completion without interruption or delay, subject to force majeure events and Tenant Delay (as defined below), in a first-class and good and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the Working Drawings, using new materials (unless otherwise noted in the Working Drawings), and in compliance with all applicable laws. If, as a result of such inspection, Tenant discovers deviations or deficiencies from the Working Drawings, then Tenant may deliver a preliminary punch list of such deviations or deficiencies (Punch List Items) to Landlord. The existence of a preliminary punch list shall not postpone the delivery of Expansion Premises as long as (i) the Punch List Items are customarily considered to be punch list items as the term is used in the construction industry, and (ii) neither the failure to complete nor the process of completing any such Punch List Items will delay or unreasonably interfere with Tenants Work or the operation of Tenants business in the Expansion Premises, and (iii) the Punch List Items will not delay Landlord obtaining Tenants certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy, as may be applicable. Subject to force majeure, Landlord shall correct or cure the Punch List Items within thirty (30) days following Landlords receipt of the preliminary punch list, or such longer period as may be reasonably necessary, provided Landlord is proceeding with due diligence to complete the Punch List Items. Landlord may enter the Expansion Premises at any reasonable time with prior notice to Tenant to correct or cure the Punch List Items, provided Landlord takes reasonable precautions to avoid interfering with Tenants Work or Tenants business at the Premises. As used herein, Substantial Completion shall mean the stage in the progress of Landlords Work when Landlords Work is sufficiently complete in accordance with the requirements of the Working Drawings, so that Tenant can (a) occupy or utilize the Expansion Premises for its intended use, or (b) complete any work which could not be completed by Tenant simultaneously with Landlords Work. As used herein, Tenant Delay shall mean any delay in the performance of Landlords Work that occurs as the result of (i) any request or change order by Tenant either that Landlord perform any work in addition to Landlords Work, or that delays, for any reason, Landlord commencing or completing Landlords Work to be performed prior to the delivery of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; (ii) any change by Tenant to the Working Drawings, other than a change required to cause the Working Drawings to conform to applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances; (iii) any failure of Tenant to respond to any request for approval required hereunder within the period specified herein for such response; (iv) any delay in Landlords Work caused by the installation of Tenants fixtures in the Expansion Premises or the performance of any work or activities by Tenant prior to the delivery of possession of the Expansion Premises to Tenant; or (v) failure by Tenant to pay any excess Total Construction Costs over the Tenant Improvement Allowance as invoiced by Landlord. cost of construction, including: labor and materials, architectural, engineering, design, and construction management fees, fees for permits and inspection, tap fees, connection fees and all other hard costs directly related to completion of Landlords Work (Total Construction Costs). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that Oxford Design Build, an affiliate of Landlord (the General Contractor), shall be the general contractor for all of Landlords Work, and their construction management fee shall be limited to nine (9%) of the hard costs of the Landlords Work (expressly excluding architectural, engineering, and design fees). In the event the Construction Costs Estimate exceeds the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Tenant shall pay one-half of the difference to Landlord upon execution by Tenant of this Amendment (Construction Deposit). If the Total Construction Costs of Landlords Work is more than the Tenant Improvement Allowance but less than the sum of the Construction Deposit plus the Tenant Improvement Allowance, then Landlord shall refund Tenant the amount by which the Construction Deposit plus Tenant Improvement Allowance exceeded the Total Construction Cost as a credit toward Base Rent. If the Total Construction Costs are less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance, Landlord shall refund the Construction Deposit received as a credit toward Base Rent, and the remaining difference shall be forfeited with no further obligation of Landlord therefore.
