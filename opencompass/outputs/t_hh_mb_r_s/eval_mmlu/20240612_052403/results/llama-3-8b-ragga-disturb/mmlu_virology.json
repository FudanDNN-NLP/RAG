Most of these viruses are very common and typically asymptomatic in most human populations studied. BK virus is associated with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus with Merkel cell cancer. Structure and genome\n\nPolyomaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with circular genomes of around 5000 base pairs. The capsid is composed of 72 pentameric capsomeres of a protein called VP1, which is capable of self-assembly into a closed icosahedron; each pentamer of VP1 is associated with one molecule of one of the other two capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3. The genome of a typical polyomavirus codes for between 5 and 9 proteins, divided into two transcriptional regions called the early and late regions due to the time during infection in which they are transcribed. Each region is transcribed by the host cell's RNA polymerase II as a single pre-messenger RNA containing multiple genes. Additional genes and other variations on this theme are present in some viruses: for example, rodent polyomaviruses have a third protein called middle tumor antigen in the early region, which is extremely efficient at inducing cellular transformation; SV40 has an additional capsid protein VP4; some examples have an additional regulatory protein called agnoprotein expressed from the late region. Cellular receptors for polyomaviruses are sialic acid residues of glycans, commonly gangliosides. The attachment of polyomaviruses to host cells is mediated by the binding of VP1 to sialylated glycans on the cell surface. In some particular viruses, additional cell-surface interactions occur; for example, the JC virus is believed to require interaction with the 5HT2A receptor and the Merkel cell virus with heparan sulfate. However, in general virus-cell interactions are mediated by commonly occurring molecules on the cell surface, and therefore are likely not a major contributor to individual viruses' observed cell-type tropism. The details of transit to the nucleus are not clear and may vary among individual polyomaviruses. It has been frequently reported that an intact, albeit distorted, virion particle is released from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell cytoplasm, where the genome is released from the capsid, possibly due to the low calcium concentration in the cytoplasm. Both expression of viral genes and replication of the viral genome occur in the nucleus using host cell machinery. The precise mechanism of this dysregulation depends on the virus; for example, SV40 LT can directly bind host cell p53, but murine polyomavirus LT does not. As these interactions begin, the LTs belonging to several polyomaviruses, including Merkel cell polyomavirus, present oncogenic potential. Taxonomy\nThe polyomaviruses are members of group I (dsDNA viruses). The classification of polyomaviruses has been the subject of several proposed revisions as new members of the group are discovered. Formerly, polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, which share many structural features but have very different genomic organizations, were classified together in the now-obsolete family Papovaviridae. (The name Papovaviridae derived from three abbreviations: Pa for Papillomavirus, Po for Polyomavirus, and Va for \"vacuolating.\") The polyomaviruses were divided into three major clades (that is, genetically-related groups): the SV40 clade, the avian clade, and the murine polyomavirus clade. A subsequent proposed reclassification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recommended dividing the family of Polyomaviridae into three genera:\n Genus Orthopolyomavirus (type species SV40)\n Genus Wukipolyomavirus (type species KI polyomavirus)\n Genus Avipolyomavirus (type species Avian polyomavirus)\n\nThe current ICTV classification system recognises six genera and 117 species, of which five could not be assigned a genus. This system retains the distinction between avian and mammalian viruses, grouping the avian subset into the genus Gammapolyomavirus. The six genera are:\n Alphapolyomavirus\n Betapolyomavirus\n Deltapolyomavirus\n Epsilonpolyomavirus\n Gammapolyomavirus\n Zetapolyomavirus\n\nThe following species are unassigned to a genus:\n Centropristis striata polyomavirus 1\n Rhynchobatus djiddensis polyomavirus 1\n Sparus aurata polyomavirus 1\n Trematomus bernacchii polyomavirus 1\n Trematomus pennellii polyomavirus 1\n\nDescription of additional viruses is ongoing. Human polyomaviruses \nMost polyomaviruses do not infect humans. Of the polyomaviruses cataloged as of 2017, a total of 14 were known with human hosts. However, some polyomaviruses are associated with human disease, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Lyon IARC polyomavirus is related to raccoon polyomavirus. List of human polyomaviruses\nThe following 14 polyomaviruses with human hosts had been identified and had their genomes sequenced as of 2017:\n\nDeltapolyomavirus contains only the four human viruses shown in the above table. The Alpha and Beta groups contain viruses that infect a variety of mammals. Antibodies to the monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus have been detected in humans suggesting that this virus - or a closely related virus - can infect humans. Clinical relevance\nAll the polyomaviruses are highly common childhood and young adult infections. Diseases caused by human polyomavirus infections are most common among immunocompromised people; disease associations include BK virus with nephropathy in renal transplant and non-renal solid organ transplant patients, JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Merkel cell virus (MCV) with Merkel cell cancer. Competition assays are frequently needed to distinguish among highly similar polyomaviruses. There are three main diagnostic techniques used for the diagnosis of the reactivation of polyomavirus in polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN): urine cytology, quantification of the viral load in both urine and blood, and a renal biopsy. History \nMurine polyomavirus was the first polyomavirus discovered, having been reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 as an extract of mouse leukemias capable of inducing parotid gland tumors. The causative agent was identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy, after whom it was once called \"SE polyoma\". The term \"polyoma\" refers to the viruses' ability to produce multiple (poly-) tumors (-oma) under certain conditions. The name has been criticized as a \"meatless linguistic sandwich\" (\"meatless\" because both morphemes in \"polyoma\" are affixes) giving little insight into the viruses' biology; in fact, subsequent research has found that most polyomaviruses rarely cause clinically significant disease in their host organisms under natural conditions. Dozens of polyomaviruses have been identified and sequenced as of 2017, infecting mainly birds and mammals. A total of fourteen polyomaviruses are known to infect humans.

The first and largest of these was the People With AIDS Health Group (PWA Health Group), founded in 1986 by Thomas Hannan, Joseph Sonnabend, and Michael Callen. AIDS buyers clubs distributed such unapproved drugs as ribavirin, dextran sulfate, and DCNB (dinitrochlorobenzene), as well as cheaper pirated versions of zidovudine (AZT), which was the first drug that was FDA-approved for the treatment of AIDS. AIDS buyers clubs also distributed information about the disease and drug developments, and became an important source of AIDS treatment education and advocacy. An example of an AIDS buyers club was drawn to wider prominence with the 2013 film release Dallas Buyers Club. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was a law passed by the United States Congress in 1992 which allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect fees from drug manufacturers to fund the new drug approval process. The Act provided that the FDA was entitled to collect a substantial application fee from drug manufacturers at the time a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted, with those funds designated for use only in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) drug approval activities. All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. Pharmaceutical companies had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. The FDA estimated that a delay of one month in a review’s completion cost its sponsor $10 million. The FDA argued that it needed additional staff to end its back-log of drugs awaiting approval for market. AIDS epidemic\n\nThe length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. PDUFA gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a revenue source, fees paid by pharmaceutical companies seeking the approval of new drugs, to supplement but not replace direct appropriations from Congress.

AIDS epidemic\n\nThe length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life-threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \"treatment IND\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992.

In 2010, it resulted in 1.3 million deaths, or 18% of all deaths in those under five years, of which 95% occurred in the developing world. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43 million), China (21 million) and Pakistan (10 million). It is the leading cause of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. Among those, 4.7 million died from infection and disorder. Child mortality is not only caused by infection and disorder: it is also caused by premature birth; birth defect; new born infection; birth complication; and diseases like malaria, sepsis, and diarrhea. In less developed countries, malnutrition is the main cause of child mortality. Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 deaths before the age of 5 while nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under-nutrition. Some of the deadliest diseases in the world that can be minimized or prevented through education, public health practices, prevention, and adequate treatment include:\n\n1. Malaria: Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite transmitted through mosquito bites. It leads to major health problems and claims at least a million lives every year. TB claimed approximately 1.4 million lives in 2011. Prevention involves vaccinating infants at high risk and ensuring appropriate treatment to control and prevent the spread of the disease. Lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of death worldwide, particularly in children and the elderly. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Prevention involves controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking, as well as promoting a healthy lifestyle. It is primarily caused by smoking and exposure to pollutants. It contributes to millions of deaths annually. Public awareness campaigns, strict enforcement of traffic laws, improving road infrastructure, and advocating safe driving practices are essential to minimize the impact of road traffic injuries. While each of these diseases requires a multifaceted approach, education, public health practices, prevention, and appropriate treatment play crucial roles in minimizing their impact and preventing unnecessary deaths.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse \n\n Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most \n\nThe typical symptoms of the mumps virus include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The incubation period of mumps is usually around 19 days, but it can range from 7 to 23 days. Infected individuals can shed the virus from 1 week before to 1 week after symptom onset, with the highest contagiousness occurring 1 to 2 days before the symptoms appear. The virus can spread to multiple organs, including the salivary glands, testes, pancreas, ovaries, mammary glands, and central nervous system (CNS). The exact mechanism of mumps encephalitis is still unclear, but it is believed to be a secondary process resulting from respiratory spread and parainfectious inflammation. It's important to practice good hygiene and ensure vaccination to prevent the spread of mumps. The common cold is easily transferable because it is an upper respiratory infection caused by rhinovirus, or other viruses. It is more commonly caused by rhinovirus, because there are more than 100 different types of rhinoviruses which all have a human reservoir; meaning they only house their infections within a human host. The pathogenesis (the ability to cause disease) of a rhinovirus occurs after the incubation period which is usually 1-2 days after encountering the virus. The epithelial cells eventually lyse (burst) releasing large numbers of virus particles into your upper respiratory tract (URT). This cycle repeats continuously and the rhinovirus has the ability to infect the overwhelming amounts of epithelial cells present in your pharynx. As cells die, the release of protein signalling molecules called cytokines recruit leukocytes (white-blood cells) to the site of infection. As the battle between the exponential growth of the virus and the human leukocytes occurs, the symptoms of the common cold are experienced. Often you experience these symptoms because your immune system is trying to battle the virus and clear the infection. When a virus infects a cell, it often inactivates the movement of these tiny hair-like projections on cells which prevent pathogens from entering your lower respiratory tract (LRT). When the ciliary motion (mucociliary escalator) is inactivated due to the increasing amount cell death, the strength of your coughs and sneezes are used to push these pathogens up and out of your URT. Only 1 case of rhinovirus was observed because it is not as harmful to a healthy individual and is often cleared within two weeks. The lower respiratory tract is sterile and infections in the LRT are often more severe than infections in the URT. Influenza and RSV are both viruses affecting the lower respiratory tract and are far more damaging to the host than rhinovirus. Influenza has an incubation period of roughly 2 days before the onset of symptoms. The pathogenesis of influenza is similar to the rhinovirus as they both multiply within epithelial cells and suppress the mucociliary escalator. There are three types of influenza virus; influenza A, influenza B, and influenza C. The letters indicate severity based on the protein coat that the influenza virus possesses. Type A is more severe for humans, as compared to type B and C. Influenza is a unique virus, as it has the ability to change. On the protein coat, influenza has glycoprotein spikes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA glycoproteins are antigens which are often recognised by your immune system as pathogenic. The protein antigens found on the virus in the previous year are completely different from the protein antigens found on the seasonal influenza virus currently, thus making you sick every year. This is known as antigenic drift. The treatment of influenza includes some antiviral mediation, only if it is given at an appropriate time and there are also multivalent vaccines. There have been more reported cases for RSV than influenza and rhinoviruses because it is not necessarily more pathogenic but has a different approach as to how it infects its host and the type of symptoms experienced. The pathogenesis of RSV is slightly different from influenza and rhinovirus because although it may also infect epithelium of the respiratory tract, it causes the bronchioles of the lungs to be partially plugged from the dead sloughed cells of the epithelium. Due to the nature of some RSV virus proteins, it can sometimes be fatal for the elderly population that have underlying conditions. Currently, there few effective antiviral medications available for this infection. Doctors will give the premature babies injections of antibodies to RSV so that this vulnerable population develops a passive immunity.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

The nutrition program under the 2004 National Nutrition Policy and Strategy promotes exclusive breastfeeding through the age of 6 months and, thereafter, the introduction of semisolid or solid foods along with continued breast milk until the child is at least age 2. Introducing breast milk substitutes to infants before age 6 months can contribute to breastfeeding failure. Nepal's Breast Milk Substitute Act (2049) of 1992 promotes and protects breastfeeding and regulates the unauthorized or unsolicited sale and distribution of breast milk substitutes. After six months, a child requires adequate complementary foods for normal growth. Lack of appropriate complementary feeding may lead to malnutrition and frequent illnesses, which in turn may lead to death. However, even with complementary feeding, the child should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. Breast milk may be  from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and/or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding physiology \n\nBreast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts, fat cells, and connective tissue. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. The third stage of milk production occurs gradually over several weeks, and is characterized by full milk supply that is regulated locally (at the breast), predominately by the infant's demand for food. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy \nChanges in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II \n\nThe third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Colostrum continues to be produced for these next few days, as Lactogenesis II occurs. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. The only way to maintain milk supply is to drain the breasts frequently. Breast milk \n\nThe content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The first type of milk produced is called colostrum. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. The breast milk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs, with the exception of Vitamin D.  The CDC, National Health Service (UK), Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all agree that breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of Vitamin D, thus they advise parents to supplement their infants with 400 IU Vitamin D daily. However, there was insufficient evidence in the most recent Cochrane Review, to determine if this quantity reduced rates of Vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) or Rickets. Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation. Delaying clamping of the cord at birth for at least one minute improves the infants' iron status for the first year. When complementary (solid) foods are introduced at about 6 months of age, parents should make sure to choose iron rich foods to help maintain their children's iron stores. The bioactive makeup of breastmilk also changes based on the needs of the infant; for example, when an infant is recovering from an upper respiratory infection, local signaling allows for increased passage of immune cells and proteins to aid the infant's immune system. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools. Although the baby has received some antibodies (IgG) through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, colostrum and mature breast milk contain many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes and proteins that decrease the risk of gastrointestinal allergies to food, respiratory allergies to air particles like pollen, and other atopic diseases, such as asthma and eczema. Process\n\nCommencement \n\nIt is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth. Uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth, and should continue for at least one hour after birth. This period of infant-mother interaction, known generally as Kangaroo Care, or the \"Golden Hour\" during the immediate postpartum period, assists in the mother-child bonding for both mother and baby, and is thought to encourage instinctual breastfeeding behavior in the infant. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth.Success with breastfeeding in this \"Golden Hour\" increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge. If the mother is unable to immediately hold the baby a family member can provide skin-to-skin care until the mother is able. Breast crawl \nAccording to studies cited by UNICEF, babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed. If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast, called the breast crawl and begins to feed. After feeding, it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting. Rushing, by picking up and moving the infant to the breast, or interrupting the process, such as removing the baby to weigh him/her, may complicate subsequent feeding. Activities such as weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding. Preterm or Low-tone Infants \nChildren who are born preterm (before 37 weeks), children born in the early term period (37 weeks-38 weeks and 6 days), and children born with low muscular tone, such as those with chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or neurological conditions like Cerebral Palsy, may have difficulty in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. Regardless of feeding method chosen, human milk feedings, whether from the mother or a donor, are important in the brain development of premature infants, and the NICU having a standardized protocol for feeding is protective against dangerous gastrointestinal infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) in these infants. Starting to breastfeed may be challenging for mothers of preterm infants, especially those born before 34 weeks, because their breasts may still be developing (in Lactogenesis I, see Breastfeeding Physiology. Additionally, mother-infant separation and the stressful environment of the NICU are also barriers to breastfeeding. Timing \n\nNewborn babies should feed 8-12 times every 24 hours, typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks. A newborn has a very small stomach capacity. The amount of breast milk that is produced is timed to meet the infant's needs in that the first milk; colostrum is concentrated but produced in only very small amounts, gradually increasing in volume to meet the expanding size of the infant's stomach capacity. Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast, however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency. Duration and exclusivity\nNumerous health organizations, including, but not limited to, the CDC, WHO, National Health Service, Canadian Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth, unless medically contraindicated. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as \"an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals and medications.\" Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases, as discussed below. After solids are introduced at around six months of age, continued breastfeeding is recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months, or longer if both the mother and child wish. The World Health Organization's guidelines recommend \"continue[d] frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. In the United States, 22.4% of babies are breastfed for 12 months, the minimum amount of time advised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In India, mothers commonly breastfeed for 2 to 3 years. Supplementation \nSupplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant, in addition to breastmilk, during the first 6 months of life. Supplementation should only be used when medically indicated and when overseen by a medical professional, such as a pediatrician or family physician, and after consultation with a lactation counselor (CLC or IBCLC). Indications for use of donor breastmilk are very closely outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Due to low availability and high cost of donor breastmilk, the AAP recommends prioritizing the use of the milk for infants born with a weight of less than 1500g (approximately 3lb 5oz), as it is helpful in decreasing rates of the severe intestinal infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, in this population. The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows. Sometimes the let-down is so strong that the baby splutters and coughs and the mother may need to remove the baby from her breast for a short time until the flow becomes less forceful. Problems with Breastfeeding\n\nInverted nipples \n\nInfants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort. Ankyloglossia \n\nAnkyloglossia, also called \"tongue-tie\" may cause shallow latch, poor milk transfer, and other problems with breastfeeding. Additionally, the birth of an infant is followed by massive fluid shifts to both offload excess fluid, which had been used to supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetus through the placenta, which is no longer needed, and supply additional fluid to the breasts in order to start the process of making milk. Delay in milk \"coming in\" \n\nWhile milk normally \"comes in\" by 5 days after birth, there are several reasons this may be delayed. Mothers experiencing a delay in their milk coming in should consult with a lactation specialist and their pediatrician, as they may need to supplement with donor milk or formula to help the infant gain weight. Low milk supply \n\nBreast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. These reasons may include fussiness, colic, preference for the bottle as opposed to the breast, long nursing duration, decreased sensation of breast fulness, and even decreased frequency of infant stools. However, in these cases, it important to reassure the parent that infant gain is absolute proof of adequate milk intake. Thus, if the infant breastfeeding exclusively, and is gaining weight appropriately, then the parent can be reassured that they are producing enough milk. On the contrary, there are many causes of true low milk supply, and these causes can manifest prior to pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Poor milk intake is signaled by poor infant weight gain, signs of dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Poor milk intake can be caused by poor milk transfer by the infant or by true low milk supply by the mother. When the milk \"comes in\" appropriately, but is followed by decreased milk supply, this is most often caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. If the baby is latching and swallowing well (signs of good milk transfer), but is not gaining weight as expected or is showing signs of dehydration, low milk supply in the mother can be suspected, and a lactation specialist should be consulted. Newborn jaundice\n\nMore than 80% of newborns develop jaundice within several days of birth. By continuing to breastfeed frequently (start at 8-12 times per day), the infant's body can usually rid itself of the bilirubin excess by encouraging more urine and stool production. However, in some cases, the infant may need additional treatments, such as UV light therapy or additional feedings (see Supplementation) to keep the condition from progressing into more severe problems. There are two types of newborn jaundice related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and may occur in the first week of life in conjunction with ongoing weight loss. While there is some argument that decreased volume of intake in breastfed infants leads to decreased excretion of bilirubin through the stool (due to decreased number of stools), recent data actually seems to reject this notion, as it was found that there is no significant difference in stool production between formula-fed and breast fed infants. On the contrary, formula-fed infants tend to lose less weight after birth compared to breastfed infants, supporting the hypothesis that breastfeeding jaundice is related to caloric intake rather than volume intake. Breast milk jaundice is jaundice that persists despite appropriate weight gain. This type of jaundice may start as breastfeeding jaundice and persist, or may not appear until after the baby has begun to gain weight, typically around 4–5 days old. There is no single cause of breast milk jaundice; rather, the causes are multifactorial and frequently debated in the literature. Breast milk jaundice is usually not a reason to stop nursing. Weaning \n\nWeaning is the process of replacing breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually increase the period between feedings and/or eliminate feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. La Leche League advises parents to shift their children's focus at bedtime away from breastfeeding, as it is often the most difficult feeding for them to let go. If the mother was experiencing lactational amenorrhea her periods will begin to return as she begins to wean, along with the return of her fertility. Contraindications to Breastfeeding\n\nMaternal Contraindications \nMedical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are fairly rare. Infants that are otherwise healthy uniformly benefit from breastfeeding, however, extra precautions should be taken or breastfeeding  avoided in circumstances including certain infectious diseases and medical conditions. Factors such as the mother's viral load complicate breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers. The World Health Organization highlights the possibility of breastfeeding in mothers on anti-viral therapy and with undetectable viral loads, especially in areas where access to clean water is poor and where death from infectious diseases is common, citing low transmission rates when the mother is on anti-viral therapy. They also recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted by their maternal and child health services to best avoid HIV transmission from mother to child. However, the CDC continues to recommend against HIV-positive mothers breastfeeding in the United States. Infant formula should only be given if this can be safely done. The worldwide rate of transmission through breastmilk is estimated to be 3.9-27%, and this risk is increased by high maternal viral load and prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Current data demonstrates that while breastfeeding for less than six months does not, independently, increase risk of HTLV-1 transmission, not breastfeeding during that time does decrease risk of transmission. As such, CDC recommends against breastfeeding when mothers have HTLV Types I or II. Recognizing the importance of breastfeeding in more resource-poor areas of the world, the World Health Organization recommends shortening the duration of breastfeeding, or avoiding breastfeeding where possible. Hemorrhagic viral disease (Marburg virus, Ebola) \nMothers with Marburg virus or Ebola should not breastfeed their infants or feed them with expressed breastmilk. As such, these infants should not be breastfed during this time and until the mother has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. However, these infants may be fed expressed breastmilk from their mother. Transmission of TB through breastmilk, without an isolated breast infection caused by the Tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has never been documented in the scientific literature. Mothers who do have an isolated breast infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed tuberculous mastitis, should not feed their infants with their own breastmilk, even if it is fed by bottle. The CDC advises that breastfeeding is safe to continue as long as the breasts are clear of lesions, also emphasizing that if pumping or hand expressing milk, proper hand-hygiene should be used to minimize transfer. Substance Use \nTobacco: Mothers who smoke or use other tobacco products can breastfeed their infants, according to La Leche League, the CDC, and the Royal Women's Hospital (Australia) However, it is important to note that maternal tobacco use may decrease milk supply. Additionally, tobacco smoking, regardless of feeding method, increases risk of SIDS and respiratory illnesses. Many medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts, however, very few medications actually reach the infant and are absorbed in a way that would actually impact the infant. In addition to the effects on the infant, many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. Patients should be encouraged to consult a lactation specialist or a medical provider trained in breastfeeding medicine if any concerns arise. Pumping-and-dumping, or stopping breastfeeding altogether, is only required in very rare circumstances, such as with radioactive medications or chemotherapy. If a parent is concerned with a possible milk contaminant, they can express and save the breastmilk until they are able to consult with a lactation specialist or another medical professional trained in breastfeeding medicine. Mothers who have suspected or confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 should thoroughly wash their hands and wear a well-fitting mask prior to breastfeeding their infant, or express breastmilk and feed the infant by bottle. Infantile Contraindications\n\nGalactosemia \nGalactosemia is a metabolic disorder that prevents the infant from breaking down galactose, which is one of the two components of lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. Mothers express milk for multiple reasons. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Maternal breastmilk is the food of choice for premature babies; these infants may be fed maternal milk through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. While informally-shared breastmilk does carry the nutritional benefits of breastmilk, this breastmilk is most often not pasteurized or screened, and thus carries with it the risk of transmitting diseases or medications that are unsafe for infants. Parents considering directed or informal milk sharing should discuss this option with their doctor, and they should be familiar with the donors medical history and milk handling practices. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. While some infants do experience this preference for the bottle, many infants do not and will be able to alternate between bottle and breast without issue. However, from available evidence, it appears to be fairly uncommon, with only approximately 7% of study participants reporting exclusive pumping. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. While some children continue to breastfeed even with this change, others may wean. Most mothers can produce enough milk for tandem nursing, but the new baby should be nursed first for at least the first few days after delivery to ensure that it receives enough colostrum. Breastfeeding triplets or larger broods is a challenge given babies' varying appetites. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding. Re-lactation is most easily accomplished with a newborn or with a baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she is more likely to be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Techniques to promote lactation use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. A dropper or syringe without the needle may be used to place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. However, even when lactation is established, the supply may not be large enough to breastfeed exclusively. Parents and other family members should watch the baby's weight gain and urine output to assess nutritional adequacy. A WHO manual for physicians and senior health workers citing a 1992 source states:  \"If a baby has been breastfeeding sometimes, the breastmilk supply increases in a few days. If a baby has stopped breastfeeding, it may take 1-2 weeks or more before much breastmilk comes.\" Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that builds community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds. WHO states, \"Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.\" Baby \n\nEarly breastfeeding is associated with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, childhood lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, or childhood leukemia later in life. The CDC reports that infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of ear infections, obesity, type 1 diabetes, asthma, SIDS, and lower respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections. Comparing breastfed and non-breastfed siblings in a given family drastically decreases the association between breasfeeding and long-term child well-being. Growth \n\nThe average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby weighs about  times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula-fed babies, which improves long-run health. The Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition and Growth (DARLING) study reported that breastfed and formula-fed groups had similar weight gain during the first 3 months, but the breastfed babies began to drop below the median beginning at 6 to 8 months and were significantly lower weight than the formula-fed group between 6 and 18 months. Infections \n\nBreast milk contains several anti-infective factors such as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and lactoferrin (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria). Exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age helps to protect an infant from gastrointestinal infections in both developing and industrialized countries. The risk of death due to diarrhea and other infections increases when babies are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to die of gastrointestinal infections than infants who switched from exclusive to partial breastfeeding at three to four months. During breastfeeding, approximately 0.25–0.5 grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to the baby via milk. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. Mortality \n\nBabies who receive no breast milk are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than those who are partially or fully breastfed. A 2013 longitudinal study reported less obesity at ages two and four years among infants who were breastfed for at least four months. Allergic diseases \n\nIn children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist. Other health effects \n\nBreastfeeding may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). About 14 to 19 percent of leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for six months or longer. However, breastfeeding is also the primary cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as the HTLV-1 virus is transmitted through breastmilk. Breastfeeding is associated with a lower chance of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 in the offspring. Breastfed babies also appear to have a lower likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Breastfeeding may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life, as indicated by lower cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels in breastfed adult women. Breastfed infants have somewhat lower blood pressure later in life, but it is unclear how much practical benefit this provides. A 1998 study suggested that breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. Breastfeeding duration has been correlated with child maltreatment outcomes, including neglect and sexual abuse. However, other studies concluded that breastfeeding was associated with increased cognitive development in childhood, although the cause may be increased mother–child interaction rather than nutrition. Fertility \n\nExclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through lactational amenorrhea, although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. This has been used as natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed. When the newborn nurses  the mother secretes oxytocin which causes  the uterus to cramp and reduce blood loss. Nursing also causes the uterus to cramp for a number of days postpartum, helping it to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Weight retention\n\nIt is unclear whether breastfeeding causes mothers to lose weight after giving birth. Chronic conditions \nBreastfeeding is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among mothers who practice it. According to the American Heart Association, breastfeeding also reduces the risk of maternal heart disease and stroke. A 2011 review found it unclear whether breastfeeding affects the risk of postpartum depression. Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\n\nDysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is a condition in which breastfeeding women develop negative emotions that begin just before the milk letdown reflex and last less than a few minutes. Many hospitals have instituted practices that encourage breastfeeding, however a 2012 survey in the US found that 24% of maternity services were still providing supplements of commercial infant formula as a general practice in the first 48 hours after birth. This review contrasts with another large review that looked at education programs alone, which found no conclusive evidence of initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. An increase in these capacities of support has shown to greatly positively effect breastfeeding rates, especially among women with education below a high school level. Mother – Adolescence is a risk factor for low breastfeeding rates, although classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can help compensate. Breast surgery\nBreastfeeding can generally be attempted after breast augmentation or reduction surgery, however prior breast surgery is a risk factor for low milk supply. A 2014 review found that women who have breast implant surgery were less likely to exclusively breast feed, however it was based on only three small studies and the reasons for the correlation were not clear. Medications \n\nBreastfeeding mothers should inform their healthcare provider about all of the medications they are taking, including herbal products. Nursing mothers may be immunized and may take most over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs without risk to the baby but certain drugs, including some painkillers and some psychiatric drugs, may pose a risk. Some substances in the mother's food and drink are passed to the baby through breast milk, including mercury (found in some carnivorous fish), caffeine, and bisphenol A. Medical conditions \n\nUndiagnosed maternal celiac disease may cause a short duration of the breastfeeding period. Mothers with all types of diabetes mellitus normally use insulin to control their blood sugar, as the safety of other antidiabetic drugs while breastfeeding is unknown. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with some hormonal differences and obesity, may have greater difficulty with producing a sufficient supply to support exclusive breastfeeding, especially during the first weeks. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status \n\nThe rates of breastfeeding in the African-American community remain much lower than any other race, for a variety of proposed reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, higher rates of poor perinatal health, higher stress levels, less access to support, and less flexibility in the workplace. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class. Comparing facilities in primarily African American neighborhoods to ones in primarily White neighborhoods, the rates of practices that support or discourage breastfeeding were: limited use of supplements (13.1% compared with 25.8%) and rooming-in (27.7–39.4%)\n\nLow-income mothers are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The use of infant formula was thought to be a way for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding mothers may feel that they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. The authors advocate that women be provided with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills, however there is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding education alone improves initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. Prevalence \n\nGlobally about 38% of babies are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States the rate of women beginning to breastfeed was 76% in 2009 increasing to 83% in 2015 with 58% still breastfeeding at 6 months, although only 25% were still breastfeeding exclusively. African-American women have persistently low rates of breastfeeding compared to White and Hispanic American women. In 2014, 58.1% of African-American women breastfeed in the early postpartum period, compared to 77.7% of White women and 80.6% of Hispanic women. Breastfeeding rates in different parts of China vary considerably. Rates in the United Kingdom were the lowest in the world in 2015 with only 0.5% of mothers still breastfeeding at a year, while in Germany 23% are doing so, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. In Australia for children born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada for children born in 2005–06, more than 50% were only breastfed and more than 15% received both breastmilk and other liquids, by the age of 3 months. The appearance of improved infant formulas in the mid 19th century and its increased use caused a decrease in breastfeeding rates, which accelerated after World War II, and for some in the US, Canada, and UK, breastfeeding was seen as uncultured. Parents of breastfed babies are less likely to miss work and lose income because their babies are sick. Looking at three of the most common infant illnesses, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and gastrointestinal illness, one study compared infants that had been exclusively breastfed for at least three months to those who had not. It found that in the first year of life there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. In addition to this, there is also the moral question as to what degree the state or medical community can interfere with the self-determination of a woman: for example in the United Arab Emirates the law requires a woman to breastfeed her baby for at least 2 years and allows her husband to sue her if she does not do so. Preventing a situation where women are denied agency and/or stigmatized for formula use is also seen as important. In 2018, in the UK, a policy statement from the Royal College of Midwives said that women should be supported and not stigmatized, if  after being given advice and information, they choose to formula feed. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has reported that women who receive formula samples at discharge are associated with lower breastfeeding rates than those who did not receive gift bags. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative \n\nThe Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a program launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with UNICEF in order to promote infant feeding and maternal bonding through certified hospitals and birthing centers. BFHI was developed as a response to the influence held by formula companies in private and public maternal health care.The initiative has two core tenets: the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In the United States the CDC reports on a study that \"examined the effect of corporate lactation programs on breastfeeding behavior among employed women in California [which] included prenatal classes, perinatal counseling, and lactation management after the return to work\". They found that \"about 75% of mothers in the lactation programs continued breastfeeding at least 6 months, although nationally only 10% of mothers employed full-time who initiated breastfeeding were still breastfeeding at 6 months.\" Research \n\nBreastfeeding research continues to assess prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes.

It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. According to WHO, exclusive breastfeeding is defined as no other food or drink, not even water, except breastmilk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse) for 6 months of life, but allows the infant to receive ORS, \n\nBreastfeeding, or nursing, is the process by which human breast milk is fed to a child. Breast milk may be  from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and/or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding physiology \n\nBreast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts, fat cells, and connective tissue. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. The third stage of milk production occurs gradually over several weeks, and is characterized by full milk supply that is regulated locally (at the breast), predominately by the infant's demand for food. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy \nChanges in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II \n\nThe third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Colostrum continues to be produced for these next few days, as Lactogenesis II occurs. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. The only way to maintain milk supply is to drain the breasts frequently. Breast milk \n\nThe content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The first type of milk produced is called colostrum. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. The breast milk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs, with the exception of Vitamin D.  The CDC, National Health Service (UK), Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all agree that breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of Vitamin D, thus they advise parents to supplement their infants with 400 IU Vitamin D daily. However, there was insufficient evidence in the most recent Cochrane Review, to determine if this quantity reduced rates of Vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) or Rickets. Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation. Delaying clamping of the cord at birth for at least one minute improves the infants' iron status for the first year. When complementary (solid) foods are introduced at about 6 months of age, parents should make sure to choose iron rich foods to help maintain their children's iron stores. The bioactive makeup of breastmilk also changes based on the needs of the infant; for example, when an infant is recovering from an upper respiratory infection, local signaling allows for increased passage of immune cells and proteins to aid the infant's immune system. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools. Although the baby has received some antibodies (IgG) through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, colostrum and mature breast milk contain many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes and proteins that decrease the risk of gastrointestinal allergies to food, respiratory allergies to air particles like pollen, and other atopic diseases, such as asthma and eczema. Process\n\nCommencement \n\nIt is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth. Uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth, and should continue for at least one hour after birth. This period of infant-mother interaction, known generally as Kangaroo Care, or the \"Golden Hour\" during the immediate postpartum period, assists in the mother-child bonding for both mother and baby, and is thought to encourage instinctual breastfeeding behavior in the infant. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth.Success with breastfeeding in this \"Golden Hour\" increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge. If the mother is unable to immediately hold the baby a family member can provide skin-to-skin care until the mother is able. Breast crawl \nAccording to studies cited by UNICEF, babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed. If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast, called the breast crawl and begins to feed. After feeding, it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting. Rushing, by picking up and moving the infant to the breast, or interrupting the process, such as removing the baby to weigh him/her, may complicate subsequent feeding. Activities such as weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding. Preterm or Low-tone Infants \nChildren who are born preterm (before 37 weeks), children born in the early term period (37 weeks-38 weeks and 6 days), and children born with low muscular tone, such as those with chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or neurological conditions like Cerebral Palsy, may have difficulty in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. Regardless of feeding method chosen, human milk feedings, whether from the mother or a donor, are important in the brain development of premature infants, and the NICU having a standardized protocol for feeding is protective against dangerous gastrointestinal infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) in these infants. Starting to breastfeed may be challenging for mothers of preterm infants, especially those born before 34 weeks, because their breasts may still be developing (in Lactogenesis I, see Breastfeeding Physiology. Additionally, mother-infant separation and the stressful environment of the NICU are also barriers to breastfeeding. Timing \n\nNewborn babies should feed 8-12 times every 24 hours, typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks. A newborn has a very small stomach capacity. The amount of breast milk that is produced is timed to meet the infant's needs in that the first milk; colostrum is concentrated but produced in only very small amounts, gradually increasing in volume to meet the expanding size of the infant's stomach capacity. Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast, however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency. Duration and exclusivity\nNumerous health organizations, including, but not limited to, the CDC, WHO, National Health Service, Canadian Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth, unless medically contraindicated. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as \"an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals and medications.\" Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases, as discussed below. After solids are introduced at around six months of age, continued breastfeeding is recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months, or longer if both the mother and child wish. The World Health Organization's guidelines recommend \"continue[d] frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. In the United States, 22.4% of babies are breastfed for 12 months, the minimum amount of time advised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In India, mothers commonly breastfeed for 2 to 3 years. Supplementation \nSupplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant, in addition to breastmilk, during the first 6 months of life. Supplementation should only be used when medically indicated and when overseen by a medical professional, such as a pediatrician or family physician, and after consultation with a lactation counselor (CLC or IBCLC). Indications for use of donor breastmilk are very closely outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Due to low availability and high cost of donor breastmilk, the AAP recommends prioritizing the use of the milk for infants born with a weight of less than 1500g (approximately 3lb 5oz), as it is helpful in decreasing rates of the severe intestinal infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, in this population. The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows. Sometimes the let-down is so strong that the baby splutters and coughs and the mother may need to remove the baby from her breast for a short time until the flow becomes less forceful. Problems with Breastfeeding\n\nInverted nipples \n\nInfants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort. Ankyloglossia \n\nAnkyloglossia, also called \"tongue-tie\" may cause shallow latch, poor milk transfer, and other problems with breastfeeding. Additionally, the birth of an infant is followed by massive fluid shifts to both offload excess fluid, which had been used to supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetus through the placenta, which is no longer needed, and supply additional fluid to the breasts in order to start the process of making milk. Delay in milk \"coming in\" \n\nWhile milk normally \"comes in\" by 5 days after birth, there are several reasons this may be delayed. Mothers experiencing a delay in their milk coming in should consult with a lactation specialist and their pediatrician, as they may need to supplement with donor milk or formula to help the infant gain weight. Low milk supply \n\nBreast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. These reasons may include fussiness, colic, preference for the bottle as opposed to the breast, long nursing duration, decreased sensation of breast fulness, and even decreased frequency of infant stools. However, in these cases, it important to reassure the parent that infant gain is absolute proof of adequate milk intake. Thus, if the infant breastfeeding exclusively, and is gaining weight appropriately, then the parent can be reassured that they are producing enough milk. On the contrary, there are many causes of true low milk supply, and these causes can manifest prior to pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Poor milk intake is signaled by poor infant weight gain, signs of dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Poor milk intake can be caused by poor milk transfer by the infant or by true low milk supply by the mother. When the milk \"comes in\" appropriately, but is followed by decreased milk supply, this is most often caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. If the baby is latching and swallowing well (signs of good milk transfer), but is not gaining weight as expected or is showing signs of dehydration, low milk supply in the mother can be suspected, and a lactation specialist should be consulted. Newborn jaundice\n\nMore than 80% of newborns develop jaundice within several days of birth. By continuing to breastfeed frequently (start at 8-12 times per day), the infant's body can usually rid itself of the bilirubin excess by encouraging more urine and stool production. However, in some cases, the infant may need additional treatments, such as UV light therapy or additional feedings (see Supplementation) to keep the condition from progressing into more severe problems. There are two types of newborn jaundice related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and may occur in the first week of life in conjunction with ongoing weight loss. While there is some argument that decreased volume of intake in breastfed infants leads to decreased excretion of bilirubin through the stool (due to decreased number of stools), recent data actually seems to reject this notion, as it was found that there is no significant difference in stool production between formula-fed and breast fed infants. On the contrary, formula-fed infants tend to lose less weight after birth compared to breastfed infants, supporting the hypothesis that breastfeeding jaundice is related to caloric intake rather than volume intake. Breast milk jaundice is jaundice that persists despite appropriate weight gain. This type of jaundice may start as breastfeeding jaundice and persist, or may not appear until after the baby has begun to gain weight, typically around 4–5 days old. There is no single cause of breast milk jaundice; rather, the causes are multifactorial and frequently debated in the literature. Breast milk jaundice is usually not a reason to stop nursing. Weaning \n\nWeaning is the process of replacing breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually increase the period between feedings and/or eliminate feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. La Leche League advises parents to shift their children's focus at bedtime away from breastfeeding, as it is often the most difficult feeding for them to let go. If the mother was experiencing lactational amenorrhea her periods will begin to return as she begins to wean, along with the return of her fertility. Contraindications to Breastfeeding\n\nMaternal Contraindications \nMedical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are fairly rare. Infants that are otherwise healthy uniformly benefit from breastfeeding, however, extra precautions should be taken or breastfeeding  avoided in circumstances including certain infectious diseases and medical conditions. Factors such as the mother's viral load complicate breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers. The World Health Organization highlights the possibility of breastfeeding in mothers on anti-viral therapy and with undetectable viral loads, especially in areas where access to clean water is poor and where death from infectious diseases is common, citing low transmission rates when the mother is on anti-viral therapy. They also recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted by their maternal and child health services to best avoid HIV transmission from mother to child. However, the CDC continues to recommend against HIV-positive mothers breastfeeding in the United States. Infant formula should only be given if this can be safely done. The worldwide rate of transmission through breastmilk is estimated to be 3.9-27%, and this risk is increased by high maternal viral load and prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Current data demonstrates that while breastfeeding for less than six months does not, independently, increase risk of HTLV-1 transmission, not breastfeeding during that time does decrease risk of transmission. As such, CDC recommends against breastfeeding when mothers have HTLV Types I or II. Recognizing the importance of breastfeeding in more resource-poor areas of the world, the World Health Organization recommends shortening the duration of breastfeeding, or avoiding breastfeeding where possible. Hemorrhagic viral disease (Marburg virus, Ebola) \nMothers with Marburg virus or Ebola should not breastfeed their infants or feed them with expressed breastmilk. As such, these infants should not be breastfed during this time and until the mother has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. However, these infants may be fed expressed breastmilk from their mother. Transmission of TB through breastmilk, without an isolated breast infection caused by the Tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has never been documented in the scientific literature. Mothers who do have an isolated breast infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed tuberculous mastitis, should not feed their infants with their own breastmilk, even if it is fed by bottle. The CDC advises that breastfeeding is safe to continue as long as the breasts are clear of lesions, also emphasizing that if pumping or hand expressing milk, proper hand-hygiene should be used to minimize transfer. Substance Use \nTobacco: Mothers who smoke or use other tobacco products can breastfeed their infants, according to La Leche League, the CDC, and the Royal Women's Hospital (Australia) However, it is important to note that maternal tobacco use may decrease milk supply. Additionally, tobacco smoking, regardless of feeding method, increases risk of SIDS and respiratory illnesses. Many medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts, however, very few medications actually reach the infant and are absorbed in a way that would actually impact the infant. In addition to the effects on the infant, many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. Patients should be encouraged to consult a lactation specialist or a medical provider trained in breastfeeding medicine if any concerns arise. Pumping-and-dumping, or stopping breastfeeding altogether, is only required in very rare circumstances, such as with radioactive medications or chemotherapy. If a parent is concerned with a possible milk contaminant, they can express and save the breastmilk until they are able to consult with a lactation specialist or another medical professional trained in breastfeeding medicine. Mothers who have suspected or confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 should thoroughly wash their hands and wear a well-fitting mask prior to breastfeeding their infant, or express breastmilk and feed the infant by bottle. Infantile Contraindications\n\nGalactosemia \nGalactosemia is a metabolic disorder that prevents the infant from breaking down galactose, which is one of the two components of lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. Mothers express milk for multiple reasons. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Maternal breastmilk is the food of choice for premature babies; these infants may be fed maternal milk through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. While informally-shared breastmilk does carry the nutritional benefits of breastmilk, this breastmilk is most often not pasteurized or screened, and thus carries with it the risk of transmitting diseases or medications that are unsafe for infants. Parents considering directed or informal milk sharing should discuss this option with their doctor, and they should be familiar with the donors medical history and milk handling practices. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. While some infants do experience this preference for the bottle, many infants do not and will be able to alternate between bottle and breast without issue. However, from available evidence, it appears to be fairly uncommon, with only approximately 7% of study participants reporting exclusive pumping. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. While some children continue to breastfeed even with this change, others may wean. Most mothers can produce enough milk for tandem nursing, but the new baby should be nursed first for at least the first few days after delivery to ensure that it receives enough colostrum. Breastfeeding triplets or larger broods is a challenge given babies' varying appetites. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding. Re-lactation is most easily accomplished with a newborn or with a baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she is more likely to be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Techniques to promote lactation use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. A dropper or syringe without the needle may be used to place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. However, even when lactation is established, the supply may not be large enough to breastfeed exclusively. Parents and other family members should watch the baby's weight gain and urine output to assess nutritional adequacy. A WHO manual for physicians and senior health workers citing a 1992 source states:  \"If a baby has been breastfeeding sometimes, the breastmilk supply increases in a few days. If a baby has stopped breastfeeding, it may take 1-2 weeks or more before much breastmilk comes.\" Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that builds community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds. WHO states, \"Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.\" Baby \n\nEarly breastfeeding is associated with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, childhood lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, or childhood leukemia later in life. The CDC reports that infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of ear infections, obesity, type 1 diabetes, asthma, SIDS, and lower respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections. Comparing breastfed and non-breastfed siblings in a given family drastically decreases the association between breasfeeding and long-term child well-being. Growth \n\nThe average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby weighs about  times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula-fed babies, which improves long-run health. The Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition and Growth (DARLING) study reported that breastfed and formula-fed groups had similar weight gain during the first 3 months, but the breastfed babies began to drop below the median beginning at 6 to 8 months and were significantly lower weight than the formula-fed group between 6 and 18 months. Infections \n\nBreast milk contains several anti-infective factors such as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and lactoferrin (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria). Exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age helps to protect an infant from gastrointestinal infections in both developing and industrialized countries. The risk of death due to diarrhea and other infections increases when babies are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to die of gastrointestinal infections than infants who switched from exclusive to partial breastfeeding at three to four months. During breastfeeding, approximately 0.25–0.5 grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to the baby via milk. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. Mortality \n\nBabies who receive no breast milk are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than those who are partially or fully breastfed. A 2013 longitudinal study reported less obesity at ages two and four years among infants who were breastfed for at least four months. Allergic diseases \n\nIn children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist. Other health effects \n\nBreastfeeding may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). About 14 to 19 percent of leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for six months or longer. However, breastfeeding is also the primary cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as the HTLV-1 virus is transmitted through breastmilk. Breastfeeding is associated with a lower chance of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 in the offspring. Breastfed babies also appear to have a lower likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Breastfeeding may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life, as indicated by lower cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels in breastfed adult women. Breastfed infants have somewhat lower blood pressure later in life, but it is unclear how much practical benefit this provides. A 1998 study suggested that breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. Breastfeeding duration has been correlated with child maltreatment outcomes, including neglect and sexual abuse. However, other studies concluded that breastfeeding was associated with increased cognitive development in childhood, although the cause may be increased mother–child interaction rather than nutrition. Fertility \n\nExclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through lactational amenorrhea, although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. This has been used as natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed. When the newborn nurses  the mother secretes oxytocin which causes  the uterus to cramp and reduce blood loss. Nursing also causes the uterus to cramp for a number of days postpartum, helping it to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Weight retention\n\nIt is unclear whether breastfeeding causes mothers to lose weight after giving birth. Chronic conditions \nBreastfeeding is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among mothers who practice it. According to the American Heart Association, breastfeeding also reduces the risk of maternal heart disease and stroke. A 2011 review found it unclear whether breastfeeding affects the risk of postpartum depression. Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\n\nDysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is a condition in which breastfeeding women develop negative emotions that begin just before the milk letdown reflex and last less than a few minutes. Many hospitals have instituted practices that encourage breastfeeding, however a 2012 survey in the US found that 24% of maternity services were still providing supplements of commercial infant formula as a general practice in the first 48 hours after birth. This review contrasts with another large review that looked at education programs alone, which found no conclusive evidence of initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. An increase in these capacities of support has shown to greatly positively effect breastfeeding rates, especially among women with education below a high school level. Mother – Adolescence is a risk factor for low breastfeeding rates, although classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can help compensate. Breast surgery\nBreastfeeding can generally be attempted after breast augmentation or reduction surgery, however prior breast surgery is a risk factor for low milk supply. A 2014 review found that women who have breast implant surgery were less likely to exclusively breast feed, however it was based on only three small studies and the reasons for the correlation were not clear. Medications \n\nBreastfeeding mothers should inform their healthcare provider about all of the medications they are taking, including herbal products. Nursing mothers may be immunized and may take most over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs without risk to the baby but certain drugs, including some painkillers and some psychiatric drugs, may pose a risk. Some substances in the mother's food and drink are passed to the baby through breast milk, including mercury (found in some carnivorous fish), caffeine, and bisphenol A. Medical conditions \n\nUndiagnosed maternal celiac disease may cause a short duration of the breastfeeding period. Mothers with all types of diabetes mellitus normally use insulin to control their blood sugar, as the safety of other antidiabetic drugs while breastfeeding is unknown. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with some hormonal differences and obesity, may have greater difficulty with producing a sufficient supply to support exclusive breastfeeding, especially during the first weeks. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status \n\nThe rates of breastfeeding in the African-American community remain much lower than any other race, for a variety of proposed reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, higher rates of poor perinatal health, higher stress levels, less access to support, and less flexibility in the workplace. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class. Comparing facilities in primarily African American neighborhoods to ones in primarily White neighborhoods, the rates of practices that support or discourage breastfeeding were: limited use of supplements (13.1% compared with 25.8%) and rooming-in (27.7–39.4%)\n\nLow-income mothers are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The use of infant formula was thought to be a way for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding mothers may feel that they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. The authors advocate that women be provided with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills, however there is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding education alone improves initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. Prevalence \n\nGlobally about 38% of babies are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States the rate of women beginning to breastfeed was 76% in 2009 increasing to 83% in 2015 with 58% still breastfeeding at 6 months, although only 25% were still breastfeeding exclusively. African-American women have persistently low rates of breastfeeding compared to White and Hispanic American women. In 2014, 58.1% of African-American women breastfeed in the early postpartum period, compared to 77.7% of White women and 80.6% of Hispanic women. Breastfeeding rates in different parts of China vary considerably. Rates in the United Kingdom were the lowest in the world in 2015 with only 0.5% of mothers still breastfeeding at a year, while in Germany 23% are doing so, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. In Australia for children born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada for children born in 2005–06, more than 50% were only breastfed and more than 15% received both breastmilk and other liquids, by the age of 3 months. The appearance of improved infant formulas in the mid 19th century and its increased use caused a decrease in breastfeeding rates, which accelerated after World War II, and for some in the US, Canada, and UK, breastfeeding was seen as uncultured. Parents of breastfed babies are less likely to miss work and lose income because their babies are sick. Looking at three of the most common infant illnesses, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and gastrointestinal illness, one study compared infants that had been exclusively breastfed for at least three months to those who had not. It found that in the first year of life there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. In addition to this, there is also the moral question as to what degree the state or medical community can interfere with the self-determination of a woman: for example in the United Arab Emirates the law requires a woman to breastfeed her baby for at least 2 years and allows her husband to sue her if she does not do so. Preventing a situation where women are denied agency and/or stigmatized for formula use is also seen as important. In 2018, in the UK, a policy statement from the Royal College of Midwives said that women should be supported and not stigmatized, if  after being given advice and information, they choose to formula feed. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has reported that women who receive formula samples at discharge are associated with lower breastfeeding rates than those who did not receive gift bags. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative \n\nThe Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a program launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with UNICEF in order to promote infant feeding and maternal bonding through certified hospitals and birthing centers. BFHI was developed as a response to the influence held by formula companies in private and public maternal health care.The initiative has two core tenets: the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In the United States the CDC reports on a study that \"examined the effect of corporate lactation programs on breastfeeding behavior among employed women in California [which] included prenatal classes, perinatal counseling, and lactation management after the return to work\". They found that \"about 75% of mothers in the lactation programs continued breastfeeding at least 6 months, although nationally only 10% of mothers employed full-time who initiated breastfeeding were still breastfeeding at 6 months.\" Research \n\nBreastfeeding research continues to assess prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes.

Breast milk may be  from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that breastfeeding begin within the first hour of a baby's life and continue as often and as much as the baby wants. Health organizations, including the WHO, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Globally, about 38% of infants are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. Breastfeeding has a number of benefits to both mother and baby, which infant formula lacks. Breastfeeding decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and diarrhea for the baby, both in developing and developed countries. Mothers may feel pressure to breastfeed, but in the developed world children generally grow up normally when bottle fed with formula. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation, and in very specific circumstances, fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational amenorrhea. Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern. However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, the duration of feeds may shorten. Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time. Smoking tobacco and consuming limited amounts of alcohol and/or coffee are not reasons to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding physiology \n\nBreast development starts in puberty with the growth of ducts, fat cells, and connective tissue. The first stage takes place during pregnancy, allowing for the development of the breast and production of colostrum, the thick, early form of milk that is low in volume, but rich in nutrition. The birth of the baby and the placenta triggers the onset of the second stage of milk production, triggering the milk to come in over the next several days. The third stage of milk production occurs gradually over several weeks, and is characterized by full milk supply that is regulated locally (at the breast), predominately by the infant's demand for food. This differs from the second stage of lactogenesis, which is regulated centrally (in the brain) by hormone feedback loops that naturally occur after the placenta is delivered. Although traditionally, lactation occurs following pregnancy, lactation may also be induced with hormone therapy and nipple stimulation in the absence of pregnancy. Lactogenesis I and Other Changes in Pregnancy \nChanges in pregnancy, starting around 16 weeks gestational age, prepare the breast for lactation. These changes, collectively known as Lactogenesis I, are directed by hormones produced by the placenta and the brain, namely estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which gradually increase throughout the pregnancy, and result in the structural development of the alveolar (milk-producing) tissue and the production of colostrum. Lactogenesis II \n\nThe third stage of labor describes the period between the birth of the baby and the delivery of the placenta, which normally lasts less than 30 minutes. Colostrum continues to be produced for these next few days, as Lactogenesis II occurs. Milk may \"come in\" as late as five days after delivery. At this stage, production of milk is triggered by milk drainage from the breasts. The only way to maintain milk supply is to drain the breasts frequently. Breast milk \n\nThe content of breast milk should be discussed in two separate categories – the nutritional content and the bioactive content, that is the enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and signaling molecules that assist the infant in ways outside of nutrition. That being said, a variety of factors can influence the nutritional makeup of breastmilk, including gestational age, age of infant, maternal age, maternal smoking, and nutritional needs of the infant. The first type of milk produced is called colostrum. The volume of colostrum produced during each feeding is appropriate for the size of the newborn stomach and is sufficient, calorically, for feeding a newborn during the first few days of life. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is rich in protein and Vitamins A, B12 and K, which supports infants' growth, brain development, vision, immune systems, red blood cells, and clotting cascade. The breast milk also has long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which help with normal retinal and neural development. As the breast milk matures over the course to several weeks, the protein content of the milk decreases on average. The caloric content of breastmilk is reflective of the caloric requirements of the infant, increasing steadily after 12 months. When a mother has her full milk supply and is feeding her infant, the first milk to be expressed is called the foremilk. If the mother is not herself deficient in vitamins, breast milk normally supplies her baby's needs, with the exception of Vitamin D.  The CDC, National Health Service (UK), Canadian Paediatric Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians all agree that breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of Vitamin D, thus they advise parents to supplement their infants with 400 IU Vitamin D daily. However, there was insufficient evidence in the most recent Cochrane Review, to determine if this quantity reduced rates of Vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25‐OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) or Rickets. Term infants typically do not need iron supplementation. Delaying clamping of the cord at birth for at least one minute improves the infants' iron status for the first year. When complementary (solid) foods are introduced at about 6 months of age, parents should make sure to choose iron rich foods to help maintain their children's iron stores. The bioactive makeup of breastmilk also changes based on the needs of the infant; for example, when an infant is recovering from an upper respiratory infection, local signaling allows for increased passage of immune cells and proteins to aid the infant's immune system. Produced during pregnancy and the first days after childbirth, colostrum is easy to digest and has laxative properties that help the infant to pass early stools. Although the baby has received some antibodies (IgG) through the placenta, colostrum contains a substance which is new to the newborn, secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Additionally, colostrum and mature breast milk contain many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory enzymes and proteins that decrease the risk of gastrointestinal allergies to food, respiratory allergies to air particles like pollen, and other atopic diseases, such as asthma and eczema. Process\n\nCommencement \n\nIt is recommended for mothers to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour after birth. Uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding can begin immediately after birth, and should continue for at least one hour after birth. This period of infant-mother interaction, known generally as Kangaroo Care, or the \"Golden Hour\" during the immediate postpartum period, assists in the mother-child bonding for both mother and baby, and is thought to encourage instinctual breastfeeding behavior in the infant. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother's skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth.Success with breastfeeding in this \"Golden Hour\" increases the likelihood of successful breastfeeding at discharge. If the mother is unable to immediately hold the baby a family member can provide skin-to-skin care until the mother is able. Breast crawl \nAccording to studies cited by UNICEF, babies naturally follow a process which leads to a first breastfeed. If placed on the mother's abdomen the baby gradually inches towards the breast, called the breast crawl and begins to feed. After feeding, it is normal for a baby to remain latched to the breast while resting. Rushing, by picking up and moving the infant to the breast, or interrupting the process, such as removing the baby to weigh him/her, may complicate subsequent feeding. Activities such as weighing, measuring, bathing, needle-sticks, and eye prophylaxis wait until after the first feeding. Preterm or Low-tone Infants \nChildren who are born preterm (before 37 weeks), children born in the early term period (37 weeks-38 weeks and 6 days), and children born with low muscular tone, such as those with chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or neurological conditions like Cerebral Palsy, may have difficulty in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth. By convention, such children are often fed on expressed breast milk or other supplementary feeds through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. Regardless of feeding method chosen, human milk feedings, whether from the mother or a donor, are important in the brain development of premature infants, and the NICU having a standardized protocol for feeding is protective against dangerous gastrointestinal infections (necrotizing enterocolitis) in these infants. Starting to breastfeed may be challenging for mothers of preterm infants, especially those born before 34 weeks, because their breasts may still be developing (in Lactogenesis I, see Breastfeeding Physiology. Additionally, mother-infant separation and the stressful environment of the NICU are also barriers to breastfeeding. Timing \n\nNewborn babies should feed 8-12 times every 24 hours, typically expressing hunger cues every one to three hours or the first two to four weeks. A newborn has a very small stomach capacity. The amount of breast milk that is produced is timed to meet the infant's needs in that the first milk; colostrum is concentrated but produced in only very small amounts, gradually increasing in volume to meet the expanding size of the infant's stomach capacity. Many newborns will typically feed for 10 to 15 minutes on each breast, however feeds may last up to 45 minutes depending on infant wakefulness and efficiency. Duration and exclusivity\nNumerous health organizations, including, but not limited to, the CDC, WHO, National Health Service, Canadian Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recommend breastfeeding exclusively for six months following birth, unless medically contraindicated. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as \"an infant's consumption of human milk with no supplementation of any type (no water, no juice, no nonhuman milk and no foods) except for vitamins, minerals and medications.\" Supplementation with human donor breastmilk may be indicated in some specific cases, as discussed below. After solids are introduced at around six months of age, continued breastfeeding is recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies be breastfed at least until 12 months, or longer if both the mother and child wish. The World Health Organization's guidelines recommend \"continue[d] frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until two years of age or beyond. In the United States, 22.4% of babies are breastfed for 12 months, the minimum amount of time advised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In India, mothers commonly breastfeed for 2 to 3 years. Supplementation \nSupplementation is defined as the medically indicated use of additional milk or fluid products to feed in infant, in addition to breastmilk, during the first 6 months of life. Supplementation should only be used when medically indicated and when overseen by a medical professional, such as a pediatrician or family physician, and after consultation with a lactation counselor (CLC or IBCLC). Indications for use of donor breastmilk are very closely outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Due to low availability and high cost of donor breastmilk, the AAP recommends prioritizing the use of the milk for infants born with a weight of less than 1500g (approximately 3lb 5oz), as it is helpful in decreasing rates of the severe intestinal infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, in this population. The baby may be seen to respond to the beginning of the flow of milk by changing from quick sucks to deep rhythmic swallows. Sometimes the let-down is so strong that the baby splutters and coughs and the mother may need to remove the baby from her breast for a short time until the flow becomes less forceful. Problems with Breastfeeding\n\nInverted nipples \n\nInfants of mothers with inverted nipples can still achieve a good latch with perhaps a little extra effort. Ankyloglossia \n\nAnkyloglossia, also called \"tongue-tie\" may cause shallow latch, poor milk transfer, and other problems with breastfeeding. Additionally, the birth of an infant is followed by massive fluid shifts to both offload excess fluid, which had been used to supply oxygen and nutrients to the fetus through the placenta, which is no longer needed, and supply additional fluid to the breasts in order to start the process of making milk. Delay in milk \"coming in\" \n\nWhile milk normally \"comes in\" by 5 days after birth, there are several reasons this may be delayed. Mothers experiencing a delay in their milk coming in should consult with a lactation specialist and their pediatrician, as they may need to supplement with donor milk or formula to help the infant gain weight. Low milk supply \n\nBreast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. These reasons may include fussiness, colic, preference for the bottle as opposed to the breast, long nursing duration, decreased sensation of breast fulness, and even decreased frequency of infant stools. However, in these cases, it important to reassure the parent that infant gain is absolute proof of adequate milk intake. Thus, if the infant breastfeeding exclusively, and is gaining weight appropriately, then the parent can be reassured that they are producing enough milk. On the contrary, there are many causes of true low milk supply, and these causes can manifest prior to pregnancy, during labor, or after the birth. Poor milk intake is signaled by poor infant weight gain, signs of dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Poor milk intake can be caused by poor milk transfer by the infant or by true low milk supply by the mother. When the milk \"comes in\" appropriately, but is followed by decreased milk supply, this is most often caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. If the baby is latching and swallowing well (signs of good milk transfer), but is not gaining weight as expected or is showing signs of dehydration, low milk supply in the mother can be suspected, and a lactation specialist should be consulted. Newborn jaundice\n\nMore than 80% of newborns develop jaundice within several days of birth. By continuing to breastfeed frequently (start at 8-12 times per day), the infant's body can usually rid itself of the bilirubin excess by encouraging more urine and stool production. However, in some cases, the infant may need additional treatments, such as UV light therapy or additional feedings (see Supplementation) to keep the condition from progressing into more severe problems. There are two types of newborn jaundice related to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding jaundice is quite common and may occur in the first week of life in conjunction with ongoing weight loss. While there is some argument that decreased volume of intake in breastfed infants leads to decreased excretion of bilirubin through the stool (due to decreased number of stools), recent data actually seems to reject this notion, as it was found that there is no significant difference in stool production between formula-fed and breast fed infants. On the contrary, formula-fed infants tend to lose less weight after birth compared to breastfed infants, supporting the hypothesis that breastfeeding jaundice is related to caloric intake rather than volume intake. Breast milk jaundice is jaundice that persists despite appropriate weight gain. This type of jaundice may start as breastfeeding jaundice and persist, or may not appear until after the baby has begun to gain weight, typically around 4–5 days old. There is no single cause of breast milk jaundice; rather, the causes are multifactorial and frequently debated in the literature. Breast milk jaundice is usually not a reason to stop nursing. Weaning \n\nWeaning is the process of replacing breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually increase the period between feedings and/or eliminate feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. La Leche League advises parents to shift their children's focus at bedtime away from breastfeeding, as it is often the most difficult feeding for them to let go. If the mother was experiencing lactational amenorrhea her periods will begin to return as she begins to wean, along with the return of her fertility. Contraindications to Breastfeeding\n\nMaternal Contraindications \nMedical conditions that do not allow breastfeeding are fairly rare. Infants that are otherwise healthy uniformly benefit from breastfeeding, however, extra precautions should be taken or breastfeeding  avoided in circumstances including certain infectious diseases and medical conditions. Factors such as the mother's viral load complicate breastfeeding recommendations for HIV-positive mothers. The World Health Organization highlights the possibility of breastfeeding in mothers on anti-viral therapy and with undetectable viral loads, especially in areas where access to clean water is poor and where death from infectious diseases is common, citing low transmission rates when the mother is on anti-viral therapy. They also recommend that national authorities in each country decide which infant feeding practice should be promoted by their maternal and child health services to best avoid HIV transmission from mother to child. However, the CDC continues to recommend against HIV-positive mothers breastfeeding in the United States. Infant formula should only be given if this can be safely done. The worldwide rate of transmission through breastmilk is estimated to be 3.9-27%, and this risk is increased by high maternal viral load and prolonged periods of breastfeeding. Current data demonstrates that while breastfeeding for less than six months does not, independently, increase risk of HTLV-1 transmission, not breastfeeding during that time does decrease risk of transmission. As such, CDC recommends against breastfeeding when mothers have HTLV Types I or II. Recognizing the importance of breastfeeding in more resource-poor areas of the world, the World Health Organization recommends shortening the duration of breastfeeding, or avoiding breastfeeding where possible. Hemorrhagic viral disease (Marburg virus, Ebola) \nMothers with Marburg virus or Ebola should not breastfeed their infants or feed them with expressed breastmilk. As such, these infants should not be breastfed during this time and until the mother has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks and is no longer contagious. However, these infants may be fed expressed breastmilk from their mother. Transmission of TB through breastmilk, without an isolated breast infection caused by the Tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), has never been documented in the scientific literature. Mothers who do have an isolated breast infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, termed tuberculous mastitis, should not feed their infants with their own breastmilk, even if it is fed by bottle. The CDC advises that breastfeeding is safe to continue as long as the breasts are clear of lesions, also emphasizing that if pumping or hand expressing milk, proper hand-hygiene should be used to minimize transfer. Substance Use \nTobacco: Mothers who smoke or use other tobacco products can breastfeed their infants, according to La Leche League, the CDC, and the Royal Women's Hospital (Australia) However, it is important to note that maternal tobacco use may decrease milk supply. Additionally, tobacco smoking, regardless of feeding method, increases risk of SIDS and respiratory illnesses. Many medicines pass into breastmilk in small amounts, however, very few medications actually reach the infant and are absorbed in a way that would actually impact the infant. In addition to the effects on the infant, many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. Patients should be encouraged to consult a lactation specialist or a medical provider trained in breastfeeding medicine if any concerns arise. Pumping-and-dumping, or stopping breastfeeding altogether, is only required in very rare circumstances, such as with radioactive medications or chemotherapy. If a parent is concerned with a possible milk contaminant, they can express and save the breastmilk until they are able to consult with a lactation specialist or another medical professional trained in breastfeeding medicine. Mothers who have suspected or confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 should thoroughly wash their hands and wear a well-fitting mask prior to breastfeeding their infant, or express breastmilk and feed the infant by bottle. Infantile Contraindications\n\nGalactosemia \nGalactosemia is a metabolic disorder that prevents the infant from breaking down galactose, which is one of the two components of lactose, a type of sugar found in milk. Mothers express milk for multiple reasons. A sick baby who is unable to nurse can take expressed milk through a nasogastric tube. Maternal breastmilk is the food of choice for premature babies; these infants may be fed maternal milk through tubes, supplemental nursing systems, bottles, spoons or cups until they develop satisfactory ability to suck and swallow breast milk. While informally-shared breastmilk does carry the nutritional benefits of breastmilk, this breastmilk is most often not pasteurized or screened, and thus carries with it the risk of transmitting diseases or medications that are unsafe for infants. Parents considering directed or informal milk sharing should discuss this option with their doctor, and they should be familiar with the donors medical history and milk handling practices. Babies feed differently with artificial nipples than from a breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. While some infants do experience this preference for the bottle, many infants do not and will be able to alternate between bottle and breast without issue. However, from available evidence, it appears to be fairly uncommon, with only approximately 7% of study participants reporting exclusive pumping. It remains popular in some developing nations, including those in Africa, for more than one woman to breastfeed a child. While some children continue to breastfeed even with this change, others may wean. Most mothers can produce enough milk for tandem nursing, but the new baby should be nursed first for at least the first few days after delivery to ensure that it receives enough colostrum. Breastfeeding triplets or larger broods is a challenge given babies' varying appetites. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding. Re-lactation is most easily accomplished with a newborn or with a baby that was previously breastfeeding; if the baby was initially bottle-fed, the baby may refuse to suckle. If the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding, she is more likely to be able to re-establish her milk supply, and more likely to have an adequate supply. Techniques to promote lactation use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin contact with the baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. A dropper or syringe without the needle may be used to place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. However, even when lactation is established, the supply may not be large enough to breastfeed exclusively. Parents and other family members should watch the baby's weight gain and urine output to assess nutritional adequacy. A WHO manual for physicians and senior health workers citing a 1992 source states:  \"If a baby has been breastfeeding sometimes, the breastmilk supply increases in a few days. If a baby has stopped breastfeeding, it may take 1-2 weeks or more before much breastmilk comes.\" Induced lactation, also called adoptive lactation, is the process of starting breastfeeding in a woman who did not give birth. This usually requires the adoptive mother to take hormones and other drugs to stimulate breast development and promote milk production. In some cultures, breastfeeding an adoptive child creates milk kinship that builds community bonds across class and other hierarchal bonds. WHO states, \"Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.\" Baby \n\nEarly breastfeeding is associated with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, childhood lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, or childhood leukemia later in life. The CDC reports that infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of ear infections, obesity, type 1 diabetes, asthma, SIDS, and lower respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections. Comparing breastfed and non-breastfed siblings in a given family drastically decreases the association between breasfeeding and long-term child well-being. Growth \n\nThe average breastfed baby doubles its birth weight in 5–6 months. By one year, a typical breastfed baby weighs about  times its birth weight. At one year, breastfed babies tend to be leaner than formula-fed babies, which improves long-run health. The Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition and Growth (DARLING) study reported that breastfed and formula-fed groups had similar weight gain during the first 3 months, but the breastfed babies began to drop below the median beginning at 6 to 8 months and were significantly lower weight than the formula-fed group between 6 and 18 months. Infections \n\nBreast milk contains several anti-infective factors such as bile salt stimulated lipase (protecting against amoebic infections) and lactoferrin (which binds to iron and inhibits the growth of intestinal bacteria). Exclusive breastfeeding till six months of age helps to protect an infant from gastrointestinal infections in both developing and industrialized countries. The risk of death due to diarrhea and other infections increases when babies are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all. Infants who are exclusively breastfed for the first six months are less likely to die of gastrointestinal infections than infants who switched from exclusive to partial breastfeeding at three to four months. During breastfeeding, approximately 0.25–0.5 grams per day of secretory IgA antibodies pass to the baby via milk. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. Mortality \n\nBabies who receive no breast milk are almost six times more likely to die by the age of one month than those who are partially or fully breastfed. A 2013 longitudinal study reported less obesity at ages two and four years among infants who were breastfed for at least four months. Allergic diseases \n\nIn children who are at risk for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having atopy), atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist. Other health effects \n\nBreastfeeding may reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Breast milk of healthy human mothers who eat gluten-containing foods presents high levels of non-degraded gliadin (the main gluten protein). About 14 to 19 percent of leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for six months or longer. However, breastfeeding is also the primary cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, as the HTLV-1 virus is transmitted through breastmilk. Breastfeeding is associated with a lower chance of developing diabetes mellitus type 1 in the offspring. Breastfed babies also appear to have a lower likelihood of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 later in life. Breastfeeding may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease in later life, as indicated by lower cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels in breastfed adult women. Breastfed infants have somewhat lower blood pressure later in life, but it is unclear how much practical benefit this provides. A 1998 study suggested that breastfed babies have a better chance of good dental health than formula-fed infants because of the developmental effects of breastfeeding on the oral cavity and airway. Breastfeeding duration has been correlated with child maltreatment outcomes, including neglect and sexual abuse. However, other studies concluded that breastfeeding was associated with increased cognitive development in childhood, although the cause may be increased mother–child interaction rather than nutrition. Fertility \n\nExclusive breastfeeding usually delays the return of fertility through lactational amenorrhea, although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. This has been used as natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed. When the newborn nurses  the mother secretes oxytocin which causes  the uterus to cramp and reduce blood loss. Nursing also causes the uterus to cramp for a number of days postpartum, helping it to return to its pre-pregnancy size. Weight retention\n\nIt is unclear whether breastfeeding causes mothers to lose weight after giving birth. Chronic conditions \nBreastfeeding is also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes among mothers who practice it. According to the American Heart Association, breastfeeding also reduces the risk of maternal heart disease and stroke. A 2011 review found it unclear whether breastfeeding affects the risk of postpartum depression. Dysphoric milk ejection reflex\n\nDysphoric milk ejection reflex (D-MER) is a condition in which breastfeeding women develop negative emotions that begin just before the milk letdown reflex and last less than a few minutes. Many hospitals have instituted practices that encourage breastfeeding, however a 2012 survey in the US found that 24% of maternity services were still providing supplements of commercial infant formula as a general practice in the first 48 hours after birth. This review contrasts with another large review that looked at education programs alone, which found no conclusive evidence of initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. An increase in these capacities of support has shown to greatly positively effect breastfeeding rates, especially among women with education below a high school level. Mother – Adolescence is a risk factor for low breastfeeding rates, although classes, books and personal counseling (professional or lay) can help compensate. Breast surgery\nBreastfeeding can generally be attempted after breast augmentation or reduction surgery, however prior breast surgery is a risk factor for low milk supply. A 2014 review found that women who have breast implant surgery were less likely to exclusively breast feed, however it was based on only three small studies and the reasons for the correlation were not clear. Medications \n\nBreastfeeding mothers should inform their healthcare provider about all of the medications they are taking, including herbal products. Nursing mothers may be immunized and may take most over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs without risk to the baby but certain drugs, including some painkillers and some psychiatric drugs, may pose a risk. Some substances in the mother's food and drink are passed to the baby through breast milk, including mercury (found in some carnivorous fish), caffeine, and bisphenol A. Medical conditions \n\nUndiagnosed maternal celiac disease may cause a short duration of the breastfeeding period. Mothers with all types of diabetes mellitus normally use insulin to control their blood sugar, as the safety of other antidiabetic drugs while breastfeeding is unknown. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with some hormonal differences and obesity, may have greater difficulty with producing a sufficient supply to support exclusive breastfeeding, especially during the first weeks. Ethnicity and socioeconomic status \n\nThe rates of breastfeeding in the African-American community remain much lower than any other race, for a variety of proposed reasons. These include the legacy of Wet nursing during slavery, higher rates of poor perinatal health, higher stress levels, less access to support, and less flexibility in the workplace. While for other races as socio-economic class raises rates of breastfeeding also go up, for the African-American community breastfeeding rates remain consistently low regardless of socio-economic class. Comparing facilities in primarily African American neighborhoods to ones in primarily White neighborhoods, the rates of practices that support or discourage breastfeeding were: limited use of supplements (13.1% compared with 25.8%) and rooming-in (27.7–39.4%)\n\nLow-income mothers are more likely to have unintended pregnancies. The use of infant formula was thought to be a way for western culture to adapt to negative perceptions of breastfeeding. Bottle feeding mothers may feel that they should be breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. The authors advocate that women be provided with education on breastfeeding's benefits as well as problem-solving skills, however there is no conclusive evidence that breastfeeding education alone improves initiation of breastfeeding or the proportion of women breastfeeding either exclusively or partially at 3 months and 6 months. Prevalence \n\nGlobally about 38% of babies are exclusively breastfed during their first six months of life. In the United States the rate of women beginning to breastfeed was 76% in 2009 increasing to 83% in 2015 with 58% still breastfeeding at 6 months, although only 25% were still breastfeeding exclusively. African-American women have persistently low rates of breastfeeding compared to White and Hispanic American women. In 2014, 58.1% of African-American women breastfeed in the early postpartum period, compared to 77.7% of White women and 80.6% of Hispanic women. Breastfeeding rates in different parts of China vary considerably. Rates in the United Kingdom were the lowest in the world in 2015 with only 0.5% of mothers still breastfeeding at a year, while in Germany 23% are doing so, 56% in Brazil and 99% in Senegal. In Australia for children born in 2004, more than 90% were initially breastfed. In Canada for children born in 2005–06, more than 50% were only breastfed and more than 15% received both breastmilk and other liquids, by the age of 3 months. The appearance of improved infant formulas in the mid 19th century and its increased use caused a decrease in breastfeeding rates, which accelerated after World War II, and for some in the US, Canada, and UK, breastfeeding was seen as uncultured. Parents of breastfed babies are less likely to miss work and lose income because their babies are sick. Looking at three of the most common infant illnesses, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, and gastrointestinal illness, one study compared infants that had been exclusively breastfed for at least three months to those who had not. It found that in the first year of life there were 2033 excess office visits, 212 excess days of hospitalization, and 609 excess prescriptions for these three illnesses per 1000 never-breastfed infants compared with 1000 infants exclusively breastfed for at least 3 months. In addition to this, there is also the moral question as to what degree the state or medical community can interfere with the self-determination of a woman: for example in the United Arab Emirates the law requires a woman to breastfeed her baby for at least 2 years and allows her husband to sue her if she does not do so. Preventing a situation where women are denied agency and/or stigmatized for formula use is also seen as important. In 2018, in the UK, a policy statement from the Royal College of Midwives said that women should be supported and not stigmatized, if  after being given advice and information, they choose to formula feed. Through efforts including the Nestlé boycott, they have advocated for bans on free samples of infant formula and for the adoption of pro-breastfeeding codes such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by the World Health Assembly in 1981 and the Innocenti Declaration by WHO and UNICEF policy-makers in August 1990. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has reported that women who receive formula samples at discharge are associated with lower breastfeeding rates than those who did not receive gift bags. Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative \n\nThe Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a program launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with UNICEF in order to promote infant feeding and maternal bonding through certified hospitals and birthing centers. BFHI was developed as a response to the influence held by formula companies in private and public maternal health care.The initiative has two core tenets: the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. In the United States the CDC reports on a study that \"examined the effect of corporate lactation programs on breastfeeding behavior among employed women in California [which] included prenatal classes, perinatal counseling, and lactation management after the return to work\". They found that \"about 75% of mothers in the lactation programs continued breastfeeding at least 6 months, although nationally only 10% of mothers employed full-time who initiated breastfeeding were still breastfeeding at 6 months.\" Research \n\nBreastfeeding research continues to assess prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes.

Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed. Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction. ; 2) Community – When people find an individual or a group that shares the same values, likes, beliefs, etc., they find community. When this commitment happens, they tend to follow the same trends as a group and when one member introduces a new idea or product, it is accepted more readily based on the previous trust that has been established. It would be beneficial for \n\n Lim and Ong (2019) observed that in contrast to communities of practice, communities of innovation may emerge by themselves or be cultivated; they usually exist for a narrower purpose of producing a new service or product over a shorter life span; they are made up of participants from either one or more functions; they require a higher level of trust between participants to be effective; there is a higher cost to their participants; and the potential benefit to the organization may be greater when they are successfully implemented. They also noted that a community of innovation (COI) may be specialized in one function like a community of practice (COP).

It involves providing incentives or rewards to individuals who demonstrate specific behaviors, such as abstinence from drugs, reduction in drug misuse, or adherence to interventions that improve physical health outcomes. The main goal of contingency management is to promote positive behavior change and ultimately reduce illicit drug use. There are several concerns regarding contingency management that need to be addressed. One concern is the perception that this intervention may \"reward\" illicit drug use. However, it is important to note that contingency management focuses on reinforcing behaviors that are consistent with recovery and sobriety, rather than rewarding drug use itself. By incentivizing abstinence or reduced drug misuse, this approach aims to motivate individuals towards healthier choices. Another concern is whether the effects of contingency management can be maintained in the long term. While some studies have shown short-term effectiveness, there is evidence suggesting that longer-term maintenance of behavior change can be challenging. However, implementing strategies for ongoing support and monitoring can help address this issue and increase the likelihood of sustained positive outcomes. Additionally, there are concerns about potential abuse of the system, as individuals may attempt to cheat their drug tests in order to receive incentives. To mitigate this risk, careful implementation and monitoring protocols should be put in place to ensure accurate testing and prevent manipulation. It's important to consider that while most research on contingency management has been conducted in the United States, there have also been studies conducted in Europe and Australia which provide additional evidence for its effectiveness. In conclusion, contingency management offers a promising approach for addressing concerns related to illicit drug use by utilizing reinforcement techniques. While challenges exist regarding perceptions of rewarding drug use, long-term effects, abuse potential, and generalizability to different healthcare systems, strategies can be implemented to mitigate these concerns. By incorporating evidence-based practices from various studies conducted globally, contingency management can be effectively utilized as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing drug misuse and promoting positive behavior change. Positive approaches are more effective than punitive approaches for people with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) who misuse drugs because of the underlying neuropsychology of many individuals with ASPD. Research has shown that individuals with ASPD, who account for a significant proportion of long-term drug users, are much more likely to respond positively to incentives rather than punishment. in 2003 found that people with ASPD who received contingency management (a positive approach involving rewards or incentives for desired behaviors) were more likely to abstain from cocaine use compared to participants without ASPD receiving contingency management or cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as participants with ASPD receiving cognitive behavioral therapy alone. This suggests that individuals with ASPD and drug misuse issues are more motivated by positive reinforcement and rewards rather than punitive measures. Positive approaches provide incentives and rewards for desired behaviors, which can help motivate individuals with ASPD to change their behavior and engage in healthier habits. By focusing on positive approaches such as contingency management, treatment providers can create an environment that encourages individuals with ASPD and drug misuse problems to make positive changes in their lives.

This process can be facilitated by ongoing counseling and support, offered once the individual has quit using and is trying to maintain sobriety. At times, these programs are mandatory, for example for drug-using offenders diverted to an aftercare program for their drug use. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), contingency management (CM), and the Matrix Model are some of the aftercare interventions found effective in improving retention in treatment, reducing methamphetamine abuse, delaying relapse and encouraging abstinence, improvement in employment status and reduction in use of other drugs among methamphetamine users. Additionally, aftercare interventions have been found effective in reducing HIV risk behavior, psychiatric symptoms of paranoia and depression, and engagement in criminal activities. The relevance of relapse prevention management in methamphetamine recovery is supported by high relapse rate among those trying to quit. On the other hand, longer duration of the initial treatment episode and participation in self-help or other treatment during the post-treatment abstinence period have been found protective against relapse - an observation that supports the role of aftercare and relapse prevention in management of meth addiction. While abstinence remains the ultimate goal of any treatment program aimed at addressing methamphetamine addiction, there is more to the process of recovery. Genetic vulnerability has been associated with both methamphetamine addiction (like other chemical addictions) and diabetes mellitus. Avoiding a drug-using peer group or other high-risk situations play an important role while one is trying to quit methamphetamine. Ensuring therapeutic adherence is also a challenge for both the conditions. Similar low rates of treatment compliance are seen among methamphetamine users as well. Similarly, recovery from methamphetamine addiction requires vigilance and sustained efforts at relapse prevention. Relapses--while certainly a setback to recovery--are inherent to the concept of all chronic medical conditions. Continuing care for methamphetamine users refers to interventions offered beyond the initial phase of treatment with an aim to prevent relapse and encourage drug-free lifestyle. Relapse prevention strategies using a combination of motivational interviewing (MI) and CBT have elicited an overall decrease in methamphetamine use and a significant increase in abstinence in the treatment groups (when compared to a self-help booklet control group). It is based on a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for tackling methamphetamine addiction whereby recovery is sought across multiple domains - spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical. However, the approach has been found to be effective with users of other stimulant drugs such as cocaine and has been reported to hold promise for methamphetamine users as well. Retention and regular attendance in meetings is expected to be a challenge based on experience with similar programs for other stimulant drugs. In spite of lack of a well established pharmacological option, aftercare for methamphetamine users still may require follow-up medical care. Effective management of these health conditions shall warrant follow-up medical care. Research seems to indicate that TCs are an effective treatment intervention for methamphetamine users as compared to treatment as usual. Furthermore, reduced substance use, criminal activity as well as improvement of mental and physical health among those completing these types of programs has been observed. Contingency management (CM) aims at preventing or reducing drug use by using positive reinforcement in the form of vouchers or other benefits, exchangeable for goods or privileges and cash rewards for drug free behavior.

This was especially the case in substance abuse treatment settings (although some systems for smoking cessation continue to use the term token economy). For some time, systems derived from token economies were used under the name contingency management; initially this was more broadly defined and referred to any direct coupling of consequences (reinforcements or punishments) with behavior (for example staying clean ); later it referred specifically to one kind of token economy. The community reinforcement approach can be combined with contingency management; ‘tokens’ are used, whereas contingency management employs the term \"vouchers\" (or related terms). Research shows this kind of token economy is easily applied outside of hospitals and is effective, allowing for less hospital-based treatment - although contingency management is used in the treatment of drug abuse in both inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mamastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. In animals, Astroviruses also cause infection of the gastrointestinal tract but may also result in encephalitis (humans and cattle), hepatitis (avian) and nephritis (avian). There have been over 50 astroviruses reported, although the ICTV officially recognizes 22 species. The genus Avastrovirus comprises three species; Chicken astrovirus (Avian nephritis virus types 1–3), Duck astrovirus (Duck astrovirus C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (Turkey astrovirus 1). The genus Mamastrovirus includes Bovine astroviruses 1 and 2, Human astrovirus (types 1-8), Feline astrovirus 1, Porcine astrovirus 1, Mink astrovirus 1 and Ovine astrovirus 1. They are non-enveloped RNA viruses with cubic capsids, approximately 28–35 nm in diameter with T=3 symmetry. Human astroviruses are part of the Mammastrovirus genus and contains 8 serotypes. The human astrovirus capsid spikes have a distinct structure. The projection domain of the human astrovirus contains a receptor binding site for polysaccharides. The amino acid sequence of the astrovirus capsid protein does not have similar homology to other known viral proteins, but the closest would be hepatitis E virus. Life cycle\nAstroviruses infect birds and mammals through the fecal-oral route. Astrovirus RNA is infectious and functions as a messenger RNA for ORF1a and ORF1b. Genome\n\nAstroviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The capability for genetic recombination appears to be present in type-3 and type-4 human astroviruses, and in porcine astrovirus strains. Evolution\nThe Astroviridae capsid is related to those of the Tymoviridae. These symptoms are usually mild but in cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), which has dehydration, immune dysfunction and anorexia as symptoms, mortality is high. Mamastrovirus \nMamastroviruses often cause gastroenteritis in infected mammals. In animals, gastroenteritis is usually undiagnosed because most astrovirus infections are asymptomatic. However, in mink and humans, astroviruses can cause diarrhea and can be fatal. Human astroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised adults. 2–8% of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children is associated with human astrovirus. In sheep, ovine astroviruses were found in the villi of the small intestine. Mamastroviruses also cause diseases of the nervous system. Symptoms of this infection include seizure, lateral recumbency and impaired coordination. Signs and symptoms in humans\nMembers of a relatively new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised. Astrovirus infection is not usually a severe situation and only in some rare cases leads to dehydration. This could be due to climatic factors influencing the life cycle or transmission method for that particular strain of Astrovirus. Pathogenesis\nAstroviruses cause gastroenteritis by causing destruction of the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of secretory functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines. Inflammatory responses were seen to not affect astrovirus pathogenesis. Epidemiology\nAstroviruses are associated with 5–9% of the cases of gastroenteritis in young children. Humans of all ages are susceptible to astrovirus infection, but children, the elderly, and those that are immunocompromised are most prone. Studies in the USA have detected astroviruses in the stools of 2–9% of children presenting symptoms; illness is most frequent in children younger than two years, although outbreaks among adults and the elderly have been reported. The occurrence of astrovirus infections vary depending on the season. Human astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal–oral route. The main mode of astrovirus transmission is by contaminated food and water. Astroviruses can also be transmitted to humans from other animal species. Furthermore, some human, duck, chicken and turkey astroviruses are phylogenetically related and share genetic features.

Astroviruses are a type of virus that was first discovered in 1975 using electron microscopes following an outbreak of diarrhea in humans. In addition to humans, astroviruses have now been isolated from numerous mammalian animal species (and are classified as genus Mamastrovirus) and from avian species such as ducks, chickens, and turkey poults (classified as genus Avastrovirus). Along with the Picornaviridae and the Caliciviridae, the Astroviridae comprise a third family of nonenveloped viruses whose genome is composed of plus-sense, single-stranded RNA. Astrovirus has a non-segmented, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome within a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid. Human astroviruses have been shown in numerous studies to be an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. In animals, Astroviruses also cause infection of the gastrointestinal tract but may also result in encephalitis (humans and cattle), hepatitis (avian) and nephritis (avian). There have been over 50 astroviruses reported, although the ICTV officially recognizes 22 species. The genus Avastrovirus comprises three species; Chicken astrovirus (Avian nephritis virus types 1–3), Duck astrovirus (Duck astrovirus C-NGB), and Turkey astrovirus (Turkey astrovirus 1). The genus Mamastrovirus includes Bovine astroviruses 1 and 2, Human astrovirus (types 1-8), Feline astrovirus 1, Porcine astrovirus 1, Mink astrovirus 1 and Ovine astrovirus 1. They are non-enveloped RNA viruses with cubic capsids, approximately 28–35 nm in diameter with T=3 symmetry. Human astroviruses are part of the Mammastrovirus genus and contains 8 serotypes. The human astrovirus capsid spikes have a distinct structure. The projection domain of the human astrovirus contains a receptor binding site for polysaccharides. The amino acid sequence of the astrovirus capsid protein does not have similar homology to other known viral proteins, but the closest would be hepatitis E virus. Life cycle\nAstroviruses infect birds and mammals through the fecal-oral route. Astrovirus RNA is infectious and functions as a messenger RNA for ORF1a and ORF1b. Genome\n\nAstroviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The capability for genetic recombination appears to be present in type-3 and type-4 human astroviruses, and in porcine astrovirus strains. Evolution\nThe Astroviridae capsid is related to those of the Tymoviridae. These symptoms are usually mild but in cases of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS), which has dehydration, immune dysfunction and anorexia as symptoms, mortality is high. Mamastrovirus \nMamastroviruses often cause gastroenteritis in infected mammals. In animals, gastroenteritis is usually undiagnosed because most astrovirus infections are asymptomatic. However, in mink and humans, astroviruses can cause diarrhea and can be fatal. Human astroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised adults. 2–8% of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in children is associated with human astrovirus. In sheep, ovine astroviruses were found in the villi of the small intestine. Mamastroviruses also cause diseases of the nervous system. Symptoms of this infection include seizure, lateral recumbency and impaired coordination. Signs and symptoms in humans\nMembers of a relatively new virus family, the astroviridae, astroviruses are now recognised as a cause of gastroenteritis in children, whose immune systems are underdeveloped, and elderly adults, whose immune systems are generally somewhat compromised. Astrovirus infection is not usually a severe situation and only in some rare cases leads to dehydration. This could be due to climatic factors influencing the life cycle or transmission method for that particular strain of Astrovirus. Pathogenesis\nAstroviruses cause gastroenteritis by causing destruction of the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of secretory functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines. Inflammatory responses were seen to not affect astrovirus pathogenesis. Epidemiology\nAstroviruses are associated with 5–9% of the cases of gastroenteritis in young children. Humans of all ages are susceptible to astrovirus infection, but children, the elderly, and those that are immunocompromised are most prone. Studies in the USA have detected astroviruses in the stools of 2–9% of children presenting symptoms; illness is most frequent in children younger than two years, although outbreaks among adults and the elderly have been reported. The occurrence of astrovirus infections vary depending on the season. Human astroviruses are transmitted by the fecal–oral route.

When a foreign substance, also known as an antigen, enters the body, specialized cells of the immune system called antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognize and capture the antigen. These APCs then present the antigen to other immune cells, specifically T cells and B cells, which are responsible for the adaptive immune response. Once the antigens are recognized, these immune cells activate and initiate an immune response tailored to that particular foreign substance. These immune complexes help in neutralizing the foreign substances and targeting them for elimination by other immune cells, such as macrophages. The immune system also has a remarkable ability to remember previous encounters with antigens. This is known as immunological memory. When the body is exposed to the same antigen again, memory T cells and B cells rapidly respond, leading to a quicker and more effective immune response. This memory response is the basis for the effectiveness of vaccines, which stimulate the immune system to create an immunological memory without causing the disease. In summary, the immune system recognizes foreign substances through specialized cells, mounts an immune response tailored to that particular substance, and neutralizes them through the production of antibodies, immune complexes, and the activation of other immune cells. Its ability to remember previous encounters allows for a faster and more efficient response upon re-exposure to the same antigen. ; The adaptive immune system is composed of two types of cells (B-cells which release antibodies and T-cells which destroy abnormal and cancerous cells). Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens). They play a vital role in adaptive immunity, which involves the recognition and targeting of specific pathogens. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins (Ig), are proteins produced by B lymphocytes in response to foreign substances, such as pathogens or antigens. Antibodies recognize specific antigens and bind to them, marking them for destruction or neutralization by other components of the immune system. Different types of antibodies have distinct characteristics and functions. The immune response involves the generation of memory cells, which are long-lived lymphocytes that persist after an infection is resolved. Memory cells are more numerous than the naïve cells present before encountering the antigen and can rapidly respond when reexposed to the same antigen. This memory response is why vaccination aims to stimulate the production of memory cells. They coordinate immune responses and eliminate infected or abnormal cells. Antibodies, produced by B lymphocytes, recognize and target antigens for destruction or neutralization. different classes also differ in where they are released in the body and at what stage of an immune response.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

There are currently seven drugs approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, including injectable interferon (IFN) α, pegylated interferon (PEG IFN), and various oral agents such as lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir. Although standard IFN is no longer used to treat hepatitis B, it played a significant role historically and provided important insights into antiviral therapy in general. Reference:\n- Chronic Hepatitis B. (Source: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 20e)\n\n Doxorubicin is commonly used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide). Doxil (see below) is used primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, or for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapy agent, has been shown to significantly reduce the levels of BDNF in the hippocampus of the rat. This evidence suggests that chemotherapy agent toxicity to cells in the hippocampus may be partially responsible for the memory declines experienced by some patients. In humans, early clinical trials (phase I) have been conducted in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, blast crisis, and a wide range of advanced or refractory solid tumors, including colon cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. Compassionate use in patients with acute myeloid leukemia has also been reported. •Sirolimus: Also known as rapamycin, this oral medication suppresses the immune system and slows the growth of abnormal lymphatic vessels that form the tumor. This can help shrink EHE tumors and improve symptoms, including pain •Tyrosine kinase inhibitors: These drugs, designed as targeted therapies for cancers, have shown short-term success with EHE. Examples include sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib. •Others like surgery can be done as treatment for the virus during its most severe.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak. They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014–2016 outbreak. The 1976 Ebola outbreak lasted about 11 weeks. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. The virus \n\n Confirmed cases of Ebola were being reported in Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 and Sierra Leone by May 2014. On Friday, 8 August 2014, following the occurrence of Ebola in the United States and Europe and with the already intense transmission ongoing in three other countries for months, the WHO declared its third PHEIC in response to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa.

In 1958, Harry Rubin and Howard Temin developed an assay where chicken embryo fibroblasts could be altered morphologically by RSV infection. Two years later Temin concluded that the transformed morphology of the cells was controlled by a genetic property \n\n Retroviruses were shown to have a single-stranded RNA genome and to replicate via a DNA intermediate, the reverse of the usual DNA-to-RNA transcription pathway. Some retroviruses can cause diseases, including several that are associated with cancer, and HIV-1 which causes AIDS. Gallo and his colleagues then opened and pioneered the field of human retrovirology with the discovery of the first human retrovirus (HTLV-1) and along with Japanese investigators showed it was a cause of a particular form of human leukemia. A year later he and his group discovered the second known human retrovirus (HTLV-2). In 1986 he and his co-workers discovered human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), the first new herpes virus found in more than 25 years and the cause of Roseola. During the 1960s, two findings emerged: replication-competent isolated viruses were related to RSV, but were non-transforming, and an isolated replication-defective strain of RSV was transformation-competent. Rous was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the significance of his discovery in 1966. Subsequently, other oncogenic human viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, were discovered. Furthermore, oncogenes were found initially in retroviruses and then in cells. A relative of HTLV-I, HTLV-II has been associated with a few rare cases of T-cell malignancies, including hairy cell leukemia, but its precise role in these diseases remains unclear.The discovery of reverse transcriptase in 1970 by two American virologists, David Baltimore and Howard Temin, earned them a Nobel Prize in Medicine. There are two major groups of retroviruses that infect humans: the **oncoretroviruses** ( _onco-_ , \"related to a tumor\") and the **lentiviruses** ( _lenti-_ , \"slow\"). There are several other groups of retroviruses that infect animals. Endogenous retrovirus sequences are found throughout the human genome. Like most enveloped viruses, all retroviruses are highly susceptible to factors that affect surface tension and are thus not transmissible through air, dust, or fomites under normal conditions, but instead require intimate contact with the infecting sources, such as bodily fluids, blood, and blood-derived products. Enveloped (+) RNA viruses that encode reverse transcriptase enzyme, which converts retroviral RNA genome into double-stranded DNA\n\nMembers of the oncoretrovirus, a subgroup of retroviruses, have long been associated with a variety of cancers in animals, including leukemias, lymphomas, and sarcomas. However, an oncoretrovirus was discovered in the late 1970s that infects humans known as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Surveillance systems are generally called upon to provide information regarding when and where health problems are occurring and who is affected. Public health surveillance systems can be passive or active. Passive surveillance systems are less time-consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination. Techniques of public health surveillance have been used in particular to study infectious diseases. Many large institutions, such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have created databases and modern computer systems (public health informatics) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as influenza, SARS, HIV, and even bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States. Syndromic surveillance\n\nSyndromic surveillance is the analysis of medical data to detect or anticipate disease outbreaks. According to a CDC definition, \"the term 'syndromic surveillance' applies to surveillance using health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response. Though historically syndromic surveillance has been utilized to target investigation of potential cases, its utility for detecting outbreaks associated with bioterrorism is increasingly being explored by public health officials.\" The first indications of disease outbreak or bioterrorist attack may not be the definitive diagnosis of a physician or a lab. Syndromic surveillance systems monitor data from school absenteeism logs, emergency call systems, hospitals' over-the-counter drug sale records, Internet searches, and other data sources to detect unusual patterns. When a spike in activity is seen in any of the monitored systems disease epidemiologists and public health professionals are alerted that there may be an issue. An early awareness and response to a bioterrorist attack could save many lives and potentially stop or slow the spread of the outbreak. The most effective syndromic surveillance systems automatically monitor these systems in real-time, do not require individuals to enter separate information (secondary data entry), include advanced analytical tools, aggregate data from multiple systems, across geo-political boundaries and include an automated alerting process. A syndromic surveillance system based on search queries was first proposed by Gunther Eysenbach, who began work on such a system in 2004. More recently, a series of more advanced linear and nonlinear approaches to influenza modeling from Google search queries have been proposed. Search trends provide indirect data on public health, while the latter two methods provide direct data. Wikipedia has also been used, though it is potentially prone to \"noise\", as it is a popular source of health information whether a user is ill or not. This methodology has also been used by Public Health England in the United Kingdom as one of their syndromic surveillance endpoints. It is the most used social media platform for public health surveillance. Laboratory-based surveillance\nSome conditions, especially chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, are supposed to be routinely managed with frequent laboratory measurements. Unlike most syndromic surveillance systems, in which each record is assumed to be independent of the others, laboratory data in chronic conditions can be theoretically linked together at the individual patient level. If patient identifiers can be matched, a chronological record of each patient's laboratory results can be analyzed as well as aggregated to the population level. Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. Laboratory surveillance differs from population-wide surveillance because it can only monitor patients who are already receiving medical treatment and therefore having lab tests done. Therefore, it is more suitable for quality management and care improvement than for epidemiological monitoring of an entire population or catchment area.

This helps to detect and control the spread of infectious diseases, such as influenza, hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections. Syndromic Surveillance: Syndromic surveillance systems monitor the signs and symptoms of diseases instead of waiting for laboratory confirmation. This can include monitoring emergency department visits, over-the-counter medication sales, or school absenteeism rates to detect outbreaks or public health emergencies. Survey-Based Surveillance: Public health departments may conduct surveys to gather information on various health issues. Environmental Monitoring: Public health departments also monitor environmental factors that impact health, such as air and water quality, food safety, and workplace hazards. This surveillance helps identify and address potential health risks in the community. These surveillance systems, among others, assist public health departments in collecting timely and accurate data to inform decision-making and interventions aimed at protecting and promoting the health of the population. This surveillance system involves a voluntary network of doctors, laboratories, and public health departments. By collecting data on disease rates from this network, sentinel surveillance helps assess the stability or change in the health levels of a population. By focusing on specific diseases or conditions, this type of surveillance allows for targeted monitoring and early detection of potential outbreaks or epidemics. Its focus on targeted monitoring, early detection, and representative sampling contributes to our understanding of disease trends and aids in public health decision-making. The field of epidemiology has evolved significantly over time, building upon the foundational work of pioneers such as Hippocrates, Semmelweis, and John Snow. The specific techniques employed depend on the type of disease being studied, but there are some common approaches that are frequently used. One commonly employed approach is surveillance. This involves systematically collecting data on cases of a particular disease within a defined population or geographical area. Surveillance can be passive, relying on reports from healthcare providers or laboratories, or active, where researchers actively seek out cases through surveys or other means. In these studies, individuals who are initially free from the disease of interest are followed over time to assess their risk of developing the condition. These studies involve comparing individuals with a certain disease (cases) to individuals without the disease (controls), and examining differences in exposures or characteristics between the two groups. These involve collecting data at a single point in time from individuals within a population or community. They examine associations between exposure levels and health outcomes across different populations or geographical areas. By employing these methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into disease patterns, risk factors, and potential interventions to improve public health. Real-time outbreak and disease surveillance system (RODS) is a syndromic surveillance system developed by the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biomedical Informatics. It is \"prototype developed at the University of Pittsburgh where real-time clinical data from emergency departments within a geographic region can be integrated to provide an instantaneous picture of symptom patterns and early detection of epidemic events.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

It's important to note that not all individuals infected with the polio virus will experience symptoms. To prevent polio, immunization is crucial. Polio vaccines are available in two forms: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV). It helps protect against infection caused by wild (naturally occurring) polio viruses. On the other hand, IPV is an injectable vaccine that contains inactivated (killed) polio viruses and provides immunity against all three types of polio virus. Vaccination is the most effective and reliable method to prevent polio. It not only protects individuals from acquiring the infection but also helps in preventing the transmission of the polio virus within communities. In many parts of the world, widespread vaccination campaigns have successfully eliminated polio transmission. However, it is important to continue immunization efforts to maintain this progress and prevent polio resurgence. It is worth noting that there have been concerns about the contamination of a specific batch of oral polio vaccine in some regions. However, overall, polio vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing polio. Vaccination remains the best preventive measure against polio and continues to be recommended by health authorities worldwide. A baby is given a dose of oral polio vaccine in a clinic in the Jah Tondo camp for internally displaced persons, near Monrovia, Liberia. Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the nervous system. Polio is incurable but it can be easily prevented through immunization. The first utilizes a live attenuated (weakened) poliovirus and is administered through oral drops. In countries where the wild poliovirus is still in circulation, this oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used because administering OPV requires minimal training and equipment. The second type of vaccine is an inactivated (killed) polio vaccine that is injected (IPV). The inactivated polio vaccine is used primarily in countries where the wild poliovirus has already been eliminated. However, poor health and malnutrition can slow the rate at which a childâ€™s immune system â€œconvertsâ€� the polio vaccine. It is not harmful to receive multiple doses of polio vaccine during immunization rounds. It is critical to immunize every child, every round; in fact, the more doses a child receives, the more protected he or she is against polio. Monovalent oral polio vaccines (mOPV) for the three types of polioviruses were used extensively in the early days of polio vaccination in the late 1950s and early 1960s, providing extensive experience of these vaccines. With tOPV, protection against all three types of wild poliovirus could be given at the same time, a very important consideration when more than one type of wild poliovirus was circulating. Ongoing human disease eradication efforts sanctioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) target dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) and all remaining circulating polioviruses that cause poliomyelitis, including type 1 wild poliovirus. Prior abandoned WHO-sanctioned human disease eradication efforts targeted yaws and malaria. However, the OPV is still used in Asia and Africa, leading to a small number of vaccine-induced polio infections each year. In 2016, the formulation of the OPV was changed to remove the already extinct and most problematic type 2 polio strain from the OPV. The attenuated virus from vaccines is much weaker and less likely to infect than the wild virus. Polio eradication efforts continue to work toward the global eradication of type 1 wild poliovirus by interrupting poliovirus transmission using the strategies of routine immunization, supplementary immunization activities (mass campaigns), and global surveillance to rapidly identify possible outbreaks. The eradication of all poliomyelitis will require successful cessation of all oral polio vaccine use and containment of all sources of poliovirus, including circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

As this field continues to develop and change throughout history, the focus remains on fair, balanced, and moral thinking across all cultural and religious backgrounds around the world. The field of medical ethics encompasses both practical application in clinical settings and scholarly work in philosophy, history, and sociology. Medical ethics encompasses beneficence, autonomy, and justice as they relate to conflicts such as euthanasia, patient confidentiality, informed consent, and conflicts of interest in healthcare. In addition, medical ethics and culture are interconnected as different cultures implement ethical values differently, sometimes placing more emphasis on family values and downplaying the importance of autonomy. This leads to an increasing need for culturally sensitive physicians and ethical committees in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Whereas bioethics tends to deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature of the human body and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics has its roots in the writings of Hippocrates, and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by Plato and Aristotle. As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds \"the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these outcome measures are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies.\" Terms like beneficence and non-maleficence are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics. Like medical ethics, nursing ethics is very narrow in its focus, especially when compared to the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, \"nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning,\" whereby it is \"the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice.\" This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, it is important to be able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision. Building partnerships: Collaborations between healthcare providers, public health officials, and social media platforms can facilitate the ethical use of social media data. Medical ethics is an applied branch of ethics which analyzes the practice of clinical medicine and related scientific research. Medical ethics is based on a set of values that professionals can refer to in the case of any confusion or conflict. Such tenets may allow doctors, care providers, and families to create a treatment plan and work towards the same common goal. It is important to note that these four values are not ranked in order of importance or relevance and that they all encompass values pertaining to medical ethics. However, a conflict may arise leading to the need for hierarchy in an ethical system, such that some moral elements overrule others with the purpose of applying\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.

Hepatitis B infections, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, are unacceptably high in Indigenous Australians. Interestingly, hepatitis B used to be known as the “Australia Antigen” as it was first discovered in Australian Aboriginal people in the 1960s. Hepatitis B is around ten times more prevalent in Indigenous communities than in the rest of Australia. Of the nearly 240,000 Australians estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis B, over 20,000 are thought to be Indigenous people. New infections with hepatitis B remain three times as common in Indigenous people as in non-Indigenous Australians. The chance of developing chronic hepatitis B depends on an individual’s age at the time of infection. Around 90% of those who were exposed as infants develop chronic hepatitis B, but only 5% of those who were exposed as adults will develop chronic infection. Most people living with chronic hepatitis B were infected as young children – often, through mother-to-child transmission at the time of birth. The prevalence of chronic (long-term) hepatitis B in Indigenous Australians varies significantly between regions. The prevalence of hepatitis B and other communicable diseases such as skin infections and influenza in Indigenous communities is intensified by the social, economic, environmental and political situation in which Indigenous Australians find themselves. In some people, chronic hepatitis B can cause severe liver scarring (cirrhosis) or liver cancer. Chronic liver disease contributes significantly to the Indigenous life expectancy gap. In the NT, a range of factors contribute to the unequal burden of liver cancer in Indigenous Australians, but hepatitis B is the most important cause. A safe, effective vaccine for hepatitis B has been provided for all infants in Australia since 2000 – and in the Northern Territory since 1990. As a result, new hepatitis B infections in children born since 2000, as well as those who received adolescent catch-up vaccination from 1998 onwards, have fallen markedly. However, funded hepatitis B vaccine for Indigenous adults is available only in some states and territories. A recent study suggested a funded catch-up vaccination program for Indigenous adults could rapidly eliminate disparity in hepatitis B incidence. Vaccination has no effect for those who already have chronic hepatitis B. It is believed over 90,000 Australians living with hepatitis B have never been diagnosed and are unaware of their infection. Only 15% of those infected are receiving treatment or monitoring for their condition. Unlike hepatitis C, hepatitis B is not yet curable, but current treatments are very well tolerated and effective at preventing liver disease and liver cancer. The profound lack of access to treatment and care among Indigenous people contributes to the disproportionate impact of hepatitis B on this population. Under the management of Miwatj Health, an Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation, a hepatitis specialist visits regularly three to four times per year. Just as importantly, a local healthcare practitioner champions the cause of hepatitis B treatment and elimination. Several other regions in the world with large Indigenous populations and high hepatitis B prevalence, such as Alaska and New Zealand, have developed programs to test most of the population and identify those with hepatitis B infections. Also important is partnering with communities and their health workers to develop new ways of building awareness of hepatitis B as an important health issue. With comprehensive public health initiatives, long-term commitment to funding and policy – including significant workforce development to ensure as many people as possible are tested and appropriately followed up – the impact of hepatitis B on Indigenous communities can be eliminated. In the case of acute hepatitis B infection, treatment is supportive, meaning that it is given with the aim of maintaining comfort, nutrition and fluids but not to cure the disease. People who have chronic hepatitis B infection are recommended to see their doctor or specialist regularly for a check-up. If you have chronic hepatitis B, you may have to take medicines for the rest of your life. Routine immunisation protects your child from hepatitis B, but see a GP if your child has symptoms like jaundice. Hepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus and occurs worldwide. Hepatitis B vaccines are available and require a series of three doses over six months. Infected hepatitis B virus infants are more likely to develop complications such as chronic infection, cirrhosis or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). It is unknown whether hepatitis B vaccine protects health-care workers from infection of mutated hepatitis B virus. Chronic hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver caused by hepatitis B virus. Around 350 million people worldwide are chronic infected carriers of the virus. Chronic hepatitis B is a very common infectious disease leading to chronic liver disease, affecting around 350 million people all over the world. In her PhD dissertation at Harvard, Emily Oster argued that Sen's hypothesis did not take account of the different rates of prevalence of the Hepatitis B virus between Asia and other parts of the world. Regions with higher rates of Hepatitis B infection tend to have higher ratios of male to female births for biological reasons which are not yet well understood, but which have been extensively documented. The Hepatitis B Foundation is a nonprofit organization that provides resources and information about hepatitis B, engages in public health outreach campaigns, and leads public policy initiatives. For the medical community, the Hepatitis B Foundation organizes the International HBV Scientific Meeting annually for scientists discuss to new discoveries in hepatitis B research.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about virology.
