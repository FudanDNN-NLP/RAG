This means that they are able to detect a higher percentage of photons, resulting in a better signal-to-noise ratio and more accurate measurement of lifetimes. Larger active area: GaAsP hybrid detectors have an active area that is on the order of 5 mm², compared to the significantly smaller active area of about 2.5 × 10⁻³ mm² for a SPAD. The larger active area allows for the detection of more photons, thereby increasing the overall sensitivity of the detector. Clean temporal response: GaAsP hybrid detectors have a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) response that is clean, without the presence of \"bumps\" and diffusion tails that are typical in conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and SPADs. If the distribution of attenuation can be estimated by a Gaussian distribution, the signal intensities (k, photon counts) follow a log-normal distribution. ; It is also assumed that the photon count values (k) are subject to Poisson distributed shot noise. However, if instrument noise contributes significantly to the measured fluctuations, the distribution of this noise must be determined and taken into account at this step. Photo detection efficiency (PDE) ranges from 20 to 50%, depending on device and wavelength, being similar to a traditional PMT ; Gain (G) is also similar to a PMT, being about 106 ; G vs. Vb dependence is linear and does not follow a power law like in the case of PMTs ; Timing jitter is optimized to have a photon arrival time resolution of about 100-300 ps ; Signal decay time is inversely proportional to square root of photoelectrons number within an excitation event ; The signal parameters are practically independent of external magnetic fields, in contrast to vacuum PMTs ; Afterpulsing probability (3-30%), defined as probability of spurious second pulses after single photon arrival ; Dark count density is frequency of \n\n The variance of the photon number distribution is \n\n In practice, multiple single-photon detectors are used in quantum key distribution devices, one for Alice and one for Bob. Due to manufacturing differences between the two detectors, their respective detection windows will be shifted by some finite amount. The only way to eliminate this vulnerability is to eliminate differences in photodetector efficiency, which is difficult to do given finite manufacturing tolerances that cause optical path length differences, wire length differences, and other defects.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

The refractive index of air is 1.00, while the refractive index of water is approximately 1.33. When light passes from air into water, it undergoes refraction, causing the light rays to bend. Oil has a refractive index of approximately 1.51, closer to that of glass (1.51) used in lenses. By using an oil immersion lens underwater, the refractive index of the lens material aligns more closely with that of water, reducing the refractive mismatch and minimizing the distortion of light rays. This medium, typically an immersion oil with a refractive index close to that of glass, eliminates the refractive barrier between the lens and the water. As a result, there is less bending and scattering of light as it passes from water to the oil to the lens, leading to enhanced resolution. Layers at this scale can have remarkable reflective properties due to light wave interference and the difference in refractive index between the layers, the air, and the substrate. This effect, known as thin-film interference, is observable in soap bubbles and oil slicks. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. When light strikes an oil film at an angle, some of the light is reflected from the top surface of the oil, and some is reflected from the bottom surface where it is in contact with the water. Because the light reflecting from the bottom travels a slightly longer path, some light wavelengths are reinforced by this delay, while others tend to be canceled, producing the colors seen.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the process is also lost. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state; thus the total entropy change may still be zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. An irreversible process increases the total entropy of system and surroundings. and its total entropy, S , increases. For example, an infinitesimal compression of a gas in a cylinder where there exists friction between the piston and the cylinder is a quasistatic, but not reversible process. If an isolated system is held initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium by internal partitioning impermeable walls, and then some operation makes the walls more permeable, then the system spontaneously evolves to reach a final new internal thermodynamic \n\n The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. If all processes in the system are reversible, the entropy is constant. An increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to in the concept of the arrow of time.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

The wide bandwidth makes them particularly suitable for tunable lasers and pulsed lasers. The dye rhodamine 6G, for example, can be tuned from 635 nm (orangish-red) to 560 nm (greenish-yellow), and produce pulses as short as 16 femtoseconds. Some of the laser dyes are rhodamine (orange, 540–680 nm), fluorescein (green, 530–560 nm), coumarin (blue 490–620 nm), stilbene (violet 410–480 nm), umbelliferone (blue, 450–470 nm), tetracene, malachite green, and others.

Most dyes have a very short time between the absorption and emission of light, referred to as the fluorescence lifetime, which is often on the order of a few nanoseconds.

Liquid dyes have an extremely high lasing threshold. In addition, the large molecules are subject to complex excited state transitions during \n\n Laser spectroscopy can be used to measure isotope enrichments of gases in the environment. Laser spectroscopy takes advantage of the different vibrational frequencies of isotopologues which cause them to absorb different wavelengths of light.

The observed frequency perturbations in the ortho-rotational and para states of thioformaldehyde are caused by vibronic spin-orbit coupling. As a result, approximately 100 Doppler-limited rovibronic transitions were detected, leading into fine structure states. The electron's energy increases along with n because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases.

The lone pair \n\n best represented by time-depending \"mixtures\" (linear combinations) of multiple orbitals. The quantum number n first appeared in the Bohr model where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, n determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of n lie at the same average distance. For this reason, orbitals with the same value of n are said to comprise a \"shell\". atoms with filled electron shells have a total dipole moment of zero: because the electrons all exist in pairs with opposite spin, every electron's magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair. Only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e., unpaired spins) can have a net magnetic moment, so ferromagnetism occurs only in materials with partially filled shells. Because of Hund's rules, the first few electrons in a shell tend to have the same spin, thereby increasing the total dipole moment. At pressures higher than 110 GPa and temperatures around 2,000 K, nitrogen forms a network solid, bound by covalent bonds in a cubic-gauche structure, abbreviated as cg-N. Each unit cell has edge length 3.805 Å, and contains eight nitrogen atoms. As a network, cg-N consists of fused rings of nitrogen atoms; at each atom, the bond angles are very close to tetrahedral.

As this happens, the rate of voltage change across the capacitor (and resistor) slows, and the voltage approaches a steady-state value. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called dielectric relaxation, \"soakage\", or \"battery action\". For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage, but it can be as much as 15% for electrolytic capacitors. In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used and/or permanently connected bleeder resistors. When disconnected at one or both ends, DC high-voltage cables can also \"recharge themselves\" to dangerous voltages. 1) The cycle begins when current from the transformer charges up the capacitor, storing positive electric charge on one of its plates and negative charge on the other. While the capacitor is charging the spark gap is in its nonconductive state, preventing the charge from escaping through the coil. ; 2) When the voltage on the capacitor reaches the breakdown voltage of the spark gap, the air in the gap ionizes, starting an electric spark, reducing its resistance to a very low level (usually less than one ohm). The total voltage V across the open terminals is simply the sum of the voltage across the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor. The current I into the positive terminal of the circuit is equal to the current through both the capacitor and the inductor. When a battery is first connected across the circuit, the current initially flows through the branch with the capacitor, causing the voltage across it to start changing. However, as time progresses, the current through the capacitor decreases while the current through the resistor increases. This changing current pattern causes the rate of voltage change across both the capacitor and resistor to slow down.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college physics.

One important application is in radiation therapy for cancer treatment. Linacs are used to generate high-energy X-rays and electrons that can be precisely targeted at tumor cells to destroy them while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. This technology allows for more effective and targeted treatment of cancer. This process helps researchers study the properties and behavior of these particles in greater detail.

Louis de Broglie argued that if particles had a wave nature, the relation E = hν would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to λ = h⁄p . Combining de Broglie's postulate with the Planck–Einstein relation leads to where p is the momentum vector, and k is the angular wave vector. In particular, massive particles can interfere with themselves and therefore diffract. The wavelength associated with a particle is the de Broglie wavelength  where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle (mass × velocity for slow-moving particles). This theory, developed by de Broglie in 1927 and revived in the 1950s, is the natural continuation of his ideas developed between 1923 and 1926, which extended the wave-particle duality introduced by Albert Einstein for the light quanta, to all the particles of matter. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. De Broglie proposed that the frequency f of a matter wave equals E/h, where E is the total energy of the particle and h is Planck's constant. For a particle at rest, the relativistic equation E=mc2 allows the derivation of the Compton frequency f for a stationary massive particle, equal to mc2/h.

Animation: phase and group velocity of electrons This animation portrays the de Broglie phase and group velocities (in slow motion) of three free electrons traveling over a field 0.4 ångströms in width. The momentum per unit mass (proper velocity) of the middle electron is lightspeed, so that its group velocity is 0.707 c. The top electron has twice the momentum, while the bottom electron has half. Note that as the momentum increases, the phase velocity decreases down to c, whereas the group velocity increases up to c, until the wave packet and its phase maxima move together near the speed of light, whereas the wavelength continues to decrease without bound.

Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity, facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c.
