If the temperature T does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used: , and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference. Also note: thermal space resolution (images) found in Thermography. ; Bi-metallic strip ; Thermistors principle: relation between temperature and electrical resistance of ceramics or polymers, range: from about 0.01 to 2,000 kelvins (−273.14 to 1,700 °C) ; Thermocouples principle: relation between temperature and voltage of metal junctions (Seebeck effect), range: from about −200 °C to +1350 °C ; Thermometer ; Thermopile is a set of connected thermocouples ; Triple Point cell used for calibrating thermometers. Compared to other dominant materials like polysilicon, tantalum (Ta) offers several advantages as a structural material for MEMS thermal actuators. This means that Ta is more resistant to deformation and can withstand higher mechanical stress. This stability is crucial for the long-term reliability and performance of MEMS devices. Furthermore, Ta has a low resistivity of 20 micro-ohm centimeters, which is lower than the resistivity of polysilicon (2000 micro-ohm centimeters). In summary, using tantalum as a structural material for MEMS thermal actuators provides a combination of high mechanical strength, thermal stability, high melting temperature, low resistivity, and low operating voltage. These advantages make tantalum a promising material for achieving improved performance and efficiency in thermal actuation applications.

To know whether the thermal contact resistance is significant or not, magnitudes of the thermal resistances of the layers are compared with typical values of thermal contact resistance. Thermal contact resistance is significant and may dominate for good heat conductors such as metals but can be neglected for poor heat conductors such as insulators. This characteristic allows them to conform to curved and uneven surfaces, making them suitable for applications such as artificial skin and epidermal electronics. This change in resistance serves as a highly sensitive temperature sensing mechanism. High Linearity and Repeatability: The bi-sheath-core fiber temperature sensors exhibit high linearity in their temperature response, meaning that the change in resistance is proportional to the change in temperature. They also possess good repeatability, meaning that the sensing performance remains consistent over multiple heating and cooling cycles. Insensitivity to Compressive Deformations: The sensors can withstand compressive deformations of up to -20% strain without being affected. This makes them robust and reliable in situations where mechanical stresses or deformations are applied.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about miscellaneous.

Examples of equipment that might use hydraulic fluids are excavators and backhoes, hydraulic brakes, power steering systems, automatic transmissions, garbage trucks, aircraft flight control systems, lifts, and industrial machinery. Water usage by hydraulic fracturing can be a problem in areas that experience water shortage. Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits, in jurisdictions where these are permitted. Further, ground water can be contaminated if fracturing fluids and formation fluids are able to escape during hydraulic fracturing. Produced water, the water that returns to the \n\nA high pressure injection injury is an injury caused by high-pressure injection of oil, grease, diesel fuel, gasoline, solvents, water, or even air, into the body. The most common causes are accidents with grease guns, paint sprayers, and pressure washers, but working on diesel and gasoline engine fuel injection systems as well as pinhole leaks in pressurized hydraulic lines can also cause this injury. Additionally, there is at least one known case of deliberate self-injection with a grease gun. With hydraulic fluids, paint, and detergents, these injuries are extremely serious as most hydraulic fluids and organic solvents are highly toxic. But even with pure water or air, these injuries cause compartment syndrome which leads to cell death if surgical intervention is delayed. Agriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about miscellaneous.
