On the other hand, if F is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial p(x) in F[x] without roots in F. Let q(x) be some irreducible factor of p(x). Since p(x) has no roots in F, q(x) also has no roots in F.

By using this assumption, it is proven that for all prime exponents p greater than or equal to 5, Fermat's equation (ap + bp + cp = 0) does not have non-trivial solutions over Q(sqrt(-2)) and Q(sqrt(-7)). In summary, Fermat's Last Theorem can be proven over Q(i) and Q(sqrt(-7)) when a specific conjecture in the Langlands programme is assumed.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra.

The number of possible choices is and this is the index (starting from 0) of C in the ordered list of k-combinations. Obviously there is for every N ∈ N exactly one k-combination at index N in the list (supposing k ≥ 1, since the list is then infinite), so the above argument proves that every N can be written in exactly one way as a sum of k binomial coefficients of the given form. The number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree k to a k-combination C is the number of k-combinations strictly less than C in the given ordering. From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each k-combination S strictly less than C, there is a unique index i such that ci is absent from S, while ck, ..., ci+1 are present in S, and no other value larger than ci is.

For example, if G is any non-trivial group, then the product G × G has a diagonal subgroup which is not the direct product of two subgroups of G . For a subgroup H of a finite group G , the index of H in G is equal to the quotient of the orders of G and H .isomorphism: Given two groups (G, ∗) and (H, ·) , an isomorphism between G and H is a bijective from G to H , that is, a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the groups in a way that respects the given group operations. G commutes with every element of H .Together, these three properties completely determine the algebraic structure of the direct product P . That is, if P is any group having subgroups G and H that satisfy the properties above, then P is necessarily isomorphic to the direct product of G and H . In some contexts, the third property above is replaced by the following: G and H are normal in P .This property is equivalent to property 3, since the elements of two normal subgroups with trivial intersection necessarily commute, a fact which can be deduced by considering the commutator [g,h] of any g in G , h in H . Given a group G and a subgroup H, and an element a ∈ G, one can consider the corresponding left coset: aH := { ah : h ∈ H }. Cosets are a natural class of subsets of a group; for example consider the abelian group G of integers, with operation defined by the usual addition, and the subgroup H of even integers. Then there are exactly two cosets: 0 + H, which are the even integers, and 1 + H, which are the odd integers (here we are using additive notation for the binary operation instead of multiplicative notation). For a general subgroup H, it is desirable to define a compatible group operation on the set of all possible cosets, { aH : a ∈ G }. A subgroup N of a group G is normal if and only if the coset equality aN = Na holds for all a ∈ G. A normal subgroup of G is denoted N ◁ G.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Therefore, it is possible to compute the coefficients of a polynomial  of p(x) corresponding to the zeros of p(x) inside G. By polynomial division one also obtains the second factor g(x) in p(x) = f(x)g(x). Each circle gives raise to a split of the polynomial p(x) in factors f(x) and g(x). This recursion stops after a finite number of proper \n\n constant d is a common divisor in S of a and b; we shall show it is in fact a greatest common divisor by showing that it lies in aS + bS. Multiplying a and b respectively by the Bézout coefficients for d with respect to a0 and b0 gives a polynomial p in aS + bS with constant term d. Then p − d has a zero constant term, and so is a multiple in S of the constant polynomial r, and therefore lies in aS + bS.

It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is \"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them\". The properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. For any element g in any group G, one can form a subgroup of all integer powers ⟨g⟩ = {gk | k ∈ Z}, called a cyclic subgroup of g. The order of g is the number of elements in ⟨g⟩; that is, the order of an element is equal to the order of its cyclic subgroup. A cyclic group is a group which is equal to one of its cyclic subgroups: G = ⟨g⟩ for some element g, called a generator. The fundamental theorem of abelian groups states that every finitely generated abelian group is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups. Because a cyclic group is abelian, each of its conjugacy classes consists of a single element. If d is a \n\n of n, then the number of elements in Z/nZ which have order d is φ(d), and the number of elements whose order divides d is exactly d. If G is a finite group in which, for each n > 0, G contains at most n elements of order dividing n, then G must be cyclic. This means G has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

If K is a subset of ker(f) then there exists a unique homomorphism h: G/K → H such that. In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on G that map K to the identity element. Therefore, by setting we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem. We can write the statement of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms of groups as \"every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a quotient group\". The first isomorphism theorem states that the image of any group G under a homomorphism is always isomorphic to a quotient of G. Specifically, the image of G under a homomorphism φ: G → H is isomorphic to G / ker(φ) where ker(φ) denotes the kernel of φ. In category theory, quotient groups are examples of quotient objects, which are dual to subobjects. (right-right) (right-left) (left-right) Equivariance can be formalized using the concept of a G-set for a group G. This is a mathematical object consisting of a mathematical set S and a group action (on the left) of G on S.If X and Y are both G-sets for the same group G, then a function f : X → Y is said to be equivariant if f(g&middot;x) = g&middot;f(x) for all g ∈ G and all x in X . If one or both of the actions are right actions the equivariance condition may be suitably modified: f(x&middot;g) = f(x)&middot;g  f(x&middot;g) = g&minus;1&middot;f(x)  f(g&middot;x) = f(x)&middot;g&minus;1  Equivariant maps are homomorphisms in the category of G-sets (for a fixed G). 1) Any group G is the homomorphic image of some free group F(S). Let S be a set of generators of G. The natural map f: F(S) → G is an epimorphism, which proves the claim. Equivalently, G is isomorphic to a quotient group of some free group F(S).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about abstract algebra. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

As [L:R] = [G:H] is odd, and there are no nonlinear irreducible real polynomials of odd degree, we must have L = R, thus [K:R] and [K:C] are powers of 2. However, C has no extension of degree 2, because every quadratic complex polynomial has a complex root, as mentioned above. an extension field of K, and a ∈ E. If a is algebraic over K, then K(a), the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K, is not only a ring but a field: K(a) is an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K. The converse is not true. Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice. An extension L/K is algebraic if and only if every sub K-algebra of L is a field. if every element of L is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in K.
