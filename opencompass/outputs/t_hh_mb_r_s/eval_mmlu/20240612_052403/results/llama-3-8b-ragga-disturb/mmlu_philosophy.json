It examines aesthetic values, often expressed through judgments of taste. Aesthetics covers both natural and artificial sources of aesthetic experience and judgment. It considers what happens in our minds when we engage with aesthetic objects or environments such as viewing visual art, listening to music, reading poetry, experiencing a play, or exploring nature. Aesthetics considers why people like some works of art and not others, as well as how art can affect moods or even our beliefs. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Beauty is one of the main subjects of aesthetics, together with art and taste. Many of its definitions include the idea that an object is beautiful if perceiving it is accompanied by aesthetic pleasure. But aesthetics typically considers questions of beauty as well as of art. It examines topics such as art works, aesthetic experience, and aesthetic judgments. Some consider aesthetics to be a synonym for the philosophy of art since Hegel, while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Although the dialogue begins with a defense of the prohibition of suicide, it serves to set the agenda for the rest of the dialogue and explores the major concerns of the argument as a whole. Socrates argues against suicide by offering two arguments in favor of the prohibition of self-killing. However, it is important to note that Socrates does not necessarily endorse these arguments himself. The discussion of suicide is closely linked to Socrates' conception of true philosophy as a \"preparation for death.\" For Socrates, philosophy involves contemplating and preparing for the afterlife. This interpretation suggests that Socrates views philosophy as a means of understanding the immortality of the soul and preparing for the transition to the next life. Socrates argues that the soul is distinct from the body and that it continues to exist even after death. Overall, the discussion of suicide in the Phaedo is intertwined with Socrates' understanding of philosophy as a preparation for death and the immortality of the soul. The Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470–399 BC) said that intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or [what is] best, just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that virtue is a matter of the intellect, because virtue and Knowledge are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to the use of Reason. Socrates's definition of moral intellectualism is a basis of the philosophy of Stoicism, wherein the consequences of that definition are called “Socratic paradoxes”, such as “There is no weakness of will”, because a person either knowingly does evil or knowingly seeks to do evil (moral \n\n Socrates speaks of a single deity, while at other times he refers to plural \"gods\". After Socrates claims to not know the answer, he uses his Socratic method to ask a number of questions and prompt deeper thinking into the topic.

For my part, if I don't produce you as a single witness to agree with what I'm saying, then I suppose I've achieved nothing worth mentioning concerning the things we’ve been discussing\" (472c).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Kant's three significant formulations of the categorical imperative are: Kant argued that the only absolutely good thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. In his essay, On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns, arguing against the position of Benjamin Constant, Des \n\n Although Kant never explicitly states what the first proposition is, it is clear that its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer. The shopkeeper treats his customer fairly, but because it is in his prudent self-interest to do so, in order to preserve his reputation, we cannot assume that he is motivated by duty, and thus \n\n \"[A]n action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not depend upon the realization of the object of the action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire.”\"A maxim of an action is its principle of volition. Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action. Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Beauty for Plato is a particularly important type of universal. For Plato the argument for a timeless idea of beauty does not involve so much whether the gods exist (Plato was not a monotheist) but rather whether there is an immaterial \n\n Influenced by Sigmund Freud, psychotherapists have turned to Greek philosophy for an understanding of eros' heightened aesthetic. For Plato, Eros takes an almost transcendent manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the object/other: \"the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty\". Plato (427–347 BC) travelled to southern Italy to study Pythagorean mathematics. When he returned to Athens and established his school, Plato also taught his students that Earth was a sphere, though he offered no justifications. In Aristotle’s view on Anaximenes, he interprets the theory as the one substance being air, and all other states of matter are different condensations of air. In Plato's interpretation of Anaximenes's theory, he considers the seven states of matter: fire, air, wind, clouds, earth and stone as different densities. Anaximenes supports this conclusion by his explanation using the concept of felting.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Aristotle notes four ways this incident may be treated. After naming them, he ranks them: \"The worst of these is to intend the action with full knowledge and not to perform \n\n of years.\" Phronesis is concerned with particulars, because it is concerned with how to act in particular situations. Aristotle holds that having phronesis is both necessary and sufficient for being virtuous; because phronesis is practical, it is impossible to be both phronetic and akratic; i.e., prudent persons cannot act against their \"better judgement\". In Protrepticus, the character 'Aristotle' states: \"For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. Although men act on general principles and laws, they do not perform general acts; all acts are particular; and so Aristotle, in describing the practical reason and its characteristic moral quality of prudence, further differentiates it from the theoretic reason by saying it is concerned immediately with particulars.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Velmans here argues that the subjective, phenomenal experience of consciousness is entirely unlike the neural states of the brain, and thus may not be reduced to them; that is, the phenomenal properties of consciousness are not identifiable with the physical brain states that arguably cause them. This was based on developments in neuroscience. However, physicalist theories of mind have had to grapple with the issue of subjective experience raised by Thomas Nagel in What Is It Like to Be a Bat? and Frank Cameron Jackson's so-called knowledge argument. He further noted that subjective experience posed the hard problem of consciousness. The inability of physicalist theories to explain conscious feeling has been termed the explanatory gap. In contrast, Daniel Dennett has claimed that no such gap exists as subjective experiences are a 'philosophical fiction'. The essay begins with the simple assertion that \"men have minds\", and Armstrong suggests that modern science may be the best tool with which to investigate the nature of the mind. He says that it seems that scientific consensus is converging on an explanation of the mind in \"purely physico-chemical terms\". He acknowledges some disagreement on the matter, but says that dissent tends to be on primarily non-scientific grounds. Armstrong writes that the purpose of his essay is to outline a Materialist account of the nature of the mind - one that is compatible with the scientific view of an entirely physico-chemical mind. This challenges the idea that everything can be explained solely in terms of physical processes. However, it is important to consider the reliability of conceivability as a guide to possibility.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts. One of Rawls’ most significant contributions to sociology is her theory of interaction order. In an influential 1987 article published in Sociological Theory, Rawls builds on Goffman’s argument that \"Interaction order\" is the sui generis site where meaning, self, and other social objects are achieved. Rawls' work on interaction order also builds on Emile Durkheim's (1893/1933) argument that society consists of social facts that must be continually made through constitutive practices in interaction (see below), Immanuel Kant's (1783) Kingdom of Ends, and Harold Garfinkel's (1967) specification of constitutive practices and their conditions of possibility in social interaction, which Garfinkel (1963) calls Trust Conditions. Interaction order is central to Rawls' arguments about race and equality (see below: Interaction Orders of Race). In more recent work, Rawls develops her position that social justice is central to Durkheim’s work. Focusing on Durkheim’s Division of Labor in Society, she expounds and elaborates his argument that modern societies require equality in order to function. Rawls' contract theory explores the concept of fairness and justice within social institutions. It posits that individuals would agree to a set of principles that ensure the fair distribution of benefits and burdens in a society, assuming they do not know their specific position within that society. By exploring this expression in relation to the philosophies of Rawls and Benhabib, the study seeks to understand how the principles of fairness, justice, and recognition can be applied in the healthcare context. In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. While in the original position, persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

I do not feel obliged to defend this reaction; it is a moral intuition deeper than any reason that could be given for it and impervious to any reason that you or anyone could give against it. Membership in the human species is not a \"morally irrelevant fact,\" as the race and sex of human beings has come to seem. If the moral irrelevance of humanity is what philosophy teaches, and so we have to choose between philosophy and the intuition that says that membership in the human species is morally relevant, then it is philosophy that will have to go.\" - Animal Rights \n\n Appeals to the precautionary principle have often characterized the debates concerning animal sentience – that is, the question of whether animals are able to feel \"subjective experiences with an attractive or aversive quality\", such as pain, pleasure, happiness, or joy – in relation to the question of whether we should legally protect sentient animals. A version of the precautionary principle suitable for the problem of animal sentience has been proposed by LSE philosopher Jonathan Birch: \"The idea is that when the evidence of sentience is inconclusive, we should 'give the animal the benefit of doubt' or 'err on the side of caution' \n\n judgements.

He sarcastically compliments Callicles on his frankness because it helps expose the truth about oratory: \"I well know that if you concur with what my soul believes, then that is the very truth. I realize that the person who intends to put a soul to an adequate test to see whether it lives rightly or not must have three qualities, all of which you have: knowledge, goodwill, and frankness.\" Socrates outlines a problem about truth when it is misaligned from public opinion: \"you don't compel me; instead you produce many false witnesses against me and try to banish me from my property, the truth. Aristotle's psychology, given in his treatise On the Soul (peri psychēs), posits three kinds of soul (\"psyches\"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. The Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470–399 BC) said that intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or [what is] best, just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that virtue is a matter of the intellect, because virtue and Knowledge are related qualities that a person accrues, possesses, and improves by dedication to the use of Reason.

In Socratic moral philosophy, priority is given to the intellect as being the way to live a good life; Socrates deemphasizes irrational beliefs or passions. Socrates have been puzzled by Socrates's view that akrasia (acting because of one's irrational passions, contrary to one's knowledge or beliefs) is impossible.

Immanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons. First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people \n\n Kant believes that all of our actions, whether motivated by inclination or morality, must follow some law. Kant then asks why we have to follow the principle of morality. Although we all may feel the force of our consciences, Kant, examining phenomena with a philosophical eye, is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so.” He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws,” but wonders how this is possible. can determine whether a maxim of lying to secure a loan is moral by attempting to universalize it and applying reason to the results. Kant's notion of universalizability has a clear antecedent in Rousseau's idea of a general will. Immanuel Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative, the \"Formula of Universal Law,\" as well as his third \"Kingdom of Ends\" formulation, also use a universal practice condition. The first formula states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to practiced as a universal law, or in a variant \"Law of Nature\" formulation, one whose practice by all persons we could will to have been a law of nature (and hence necessarily governing the behavior of all persons throughout all time and space).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

In ethics, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton) authors have attempted to pursue Thomas Hobbes' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the prisoner's dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. 1) Consequentialist ethics, or theories holding that normative properties of acts depend only on consequences. The paradigm consequentialist family of theories is utilitarianism, which holds that whether an act is morally right depends on whether that act maximizes some sort of net good. This theory's main developments came from Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill who distinguished between an act and rule utilitarianist morality. Later developments have also adjusted the theory, most notably Henry Sidgwick who introduced the idea of motive or intent in morality, and Peter Singer who introduced the idea of preference in moral decision making. Kant, for example, has been criticized for defining morality in terms of the formal feature of being a \"universal law\", and then attempting to derive from this formal feature various concrete moral duties. Other philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes and David Gauthier, have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims—that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so \n\n Thomas Nagel has argued that Joshua Greene, in his book Moral Tribes, is too quick to conclude utilitarianism specifically from the general goal of constructing an impartial morality; for example, he says, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls offer other impartial approaches to ethical questions. But he also claims that people have a tendency to see facts in a way that serves their ingroup, even if there's no disagreement about the underlying moral principles that govern the disputes.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Anscombe was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein and became an authority on his work and edited and translated many books drawn from his writings, above all his Philosophical Investigations.

O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. A related argument is from conscience; John Henry Newman argued that the conscience supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Often, they consider that morality seems to be binding – obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference, but imply that the obligation will stand, regardless of other factors or \n\nWittgenstein's method of dismissing the Cartesian sceptic can also be applied to the problems posed by the 'moral sceptic', who denies the truth of all ethical or moral claims. Just as Wittgenstein's focus on public language enables us to dismiss the traditional problem of other minds, a focus on public moral practices or language-games allows us to dismiss the idea that moral claims are always meaningless, false, or nonsensical. In this context, the moral sceptic is misguided in a similar way to the solipsist who implicitly admits the existence of other minds in their practices. The moral sceptic, by engaging in moral activities, implicitly acknowledges the existence of meaningful moral positions.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Mill appreciates the force of this objection and argues \n\n In the 1958 article where R. N. Smart introduced the term \"negative utilitarianism\", he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, \"a benevolent world-exploder\", would have a duty to do so. The term \"negative utilitarianism\" was introduced by R. N. Smart in his 1958 reply to Karl Popper's book The Open Society and Its Enemies, published in 1945. In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy. The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism. Ancient Greek philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene has been said to be \"one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].\" In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist Edmund Gurney who wrote: \"Enough suffering will always remain to make the question of the desirability ... of their sojourn on earth a question which numbers will answer ... in the negative.... There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified. The term \"negative utilitarianism\" was introduced by R. Ninian Smart in 1958 in his reply to Karl Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies. Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism: that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Mill took many elements of his version of utilitarianism from Jeremy Bentham, the great nineteenth-century legal reformer, who along with William Paley were the two most influential English utilitarians prior to Mill. In particular, Mill tried to develop a more refined form of utilitarianism that would harmonize better with ordinary morality and highlight the importance in the ethical life of intellectual pleasures, self-development, high ideals of character, and conventional moral rules.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

According to Berkeley, God is the entity who controls everything, yet Berkeley also argued that \"abstract object[s] do not exist in space or time\". In other words, as Warnock argues, Berkeley \"had recognized that he could not square with his own talk of spirits, of our minds and of God; for these are perceivers and not among objects of perception.

Central to this effort is an account of the circumstances of justice, inspired by David Hume, and a fair choice situation for parties facing such circumstances, similar to some of Immanuel Kant's views. Rawls offers a model of a fair choice situation (the original position with its veil of ignorance) within which parties would hypothetically choose mutually acceptable principles of justice. Under such constraints, Rawls believes that parties would find his favoured principles of justice to be especially attractive, winning out over varied alternatives, including utilitarian and 'right wing' libertarian accounts. Rawls (1999) outlined his ‘justice as fairness’ with two principles: that each person has the equal right \n\n Organizational injustice redirects to here, and is the flip-side, often more easily considered. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety \n\n Political Liberalism is a 1993 book by the American philosopher John Rawls, an update to his earlier A Theory of Justice (1971). In it, he attempts to show that his theory of justice is not a \"comprehensive conception of the good\" but is instead compatible with a liberal conception of the role of justice, namely, that government should be neutral between competing conceptions of the good. Rawls tries to show that his two principles of justice, properly understood, form a \"theory of the right\" (as opposed to a theory of the good) which would be supported by all reasonable individuals, even under conditions of reasonable pluralism. In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the Hobbesian state of nature. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of distributive justice in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy.

Singer relies on evolutionary theories to justify his claim. For most of our evolutionary history, human beings have lived in small groups where violence was ubiquitous. Deontological judgements linked to emotional and intuitive responses were developed by human beings as they were confronted with personal and close interactions with others. In the past century, our social organizations were altered and so these types of interactions have become less frequent. Therefore, Singer argues that we should rely on more sophisticated consequentialist judgements that fit better in our modern times than the deontological judgements that were useful for more rudimentary interactions. judgements. According to him, moral constructivism searches for reasonable grounds whereas deontological judgements rely on hasty and emotional responses. Singer argues our most immediate moral intuitions should be challenged. He gives the example of a brother and sister who secretly decide to have sex with each other using contraceptives. Our first intuitive reaction is a firm condemnation of incest as morally wrong. However, a consequentialist judgement brings another conclusion. As the brother and sister did not tell anyone and they used contraceptives, the incest did not have any harmful consequences. This is not to say that this condition is a life sentence. Authors like Mkize (2003) highlight that assistance from traditional healers is also one of the options available to people with mental illness. There are many reasons why duty-bearers fail individuals with Bipolar Disorder. One of them is the inadequate number of trained professionals to care for such individuals. SAFMH strongly dissents from these notions. We submit that it is wholly possible for any individual to thrive in their surroundings if they are given the appropriate tools to do so. Similarly, we call upon organisations engaging in advocacy and awareness-raising activities to provide information to the public to diminish stigma and enable communities to better support their loved ones, employees and school-going individuals, and for the state to actively invest in these types of activities. It offers an opportunity to examine how we as a society treat these individuals and what improvements can be made to their lives through law and policy reforms as well as through advocacy and awareness raising interventions. Often underestimated, they are treated as second-class citizens, denied of agency and stripped of prospects for self-improvement. For millennia, people with intellectual disabilities have often been kept in institutions or hidden out of sight; with families sometimes ashamed of them. With a clearly visible disability, people with Down syndrome are often victims of stigma. Corrigan and Watson (2002) discuss stigma in the context of people with mental disabilities. They illustrate that people with these illnesses are “challenged doubly” with the symptoms and effects of their disability on the one hand and stereotypes and prejudices on the other. And among the most vulnerable are citizens with intellectual disabilities – whose dignity and rights are often overlooked because they are poorly understood, or all too easily ignored. The voices of those who lack agency or the ability to self-advocate are often drowned out, their wishes and their needs scattered to the wind. In a country where services are woefully inadequate, can their rights be realised? And what can be done to improve the situation of such individuals and to allow them to live with a sense of dignity? If there are inadequate mechanisms to enforce both civil and political and socio-economic entitlements, a person’s sense of dignity is essentially voided. This is not aided by the pervasive stigma with which people with intellectual disabilities are contended or the failure to prioritise the rights of such individuals. SAFMH has some propositions. An example of how one may educate themselves would be through accessing documents designed for this purpose such as the SAFMH Guide to Supporting Loved Ones with Intellectual Disabilities or through approaching one of SAFMH’s mental health societies which operate in different parts of the country. People with intellectual disabilities often need to be assisted in order to raise their voices and it is through learning about their entitlements and in being supported to compare what they have versus what they deserve that they can begin to demand what they want and need. People with intellectual disabilities should also be encouraged by those providing services to them to become involved in human rights activism such as the South African Mental Health Advocacy Movement. This occasion allows us to look back at the past, examine the present and envisage the future we want for people so-situated. In view of this occasion, SAFMH has issued a press release on the subject. For centuries, people with intellectual disabilities have been systemically excluded from ordinary societal life. Treated as second-class citizens, such individuals have been isolated and placed in environments where they are often warehoused like unwanted and defective products, as opposed to being treated like human beings, deserving of inclusion, dignity, respect and a high quality of life. While there have been significant present-day attempts to change attitudes and integrate such individuals into employment and educational settings and also into communities, for many, the situation has not changed much, with the effect that people with intellectual disabilities continue to languish, living without purpose or meaning. In its 2019 campaign for Intellectual Disability Awareness Month (March 2019), the South African Federation for Mental Health (SAFMH) intends to make an attempt to combat misconceptions surrounding intellectual disability and to show that not only do people with intellectual disabilities have the capacity to lead fulfilling lives, but also the ability to make meaningful contributions as responsible and productive members of society. Our campaign intends to blot out the differences between people living with intellectual disabilities and their non-disabled counterparts, showing that we are all human and deserving of dignity and opportunity. Our campaign is thus entitled “We are all pieces of the same puzzle.” It will canvass three areas. First of all it will look at the construct of people with intellectual disabilities being entitled to education, second the right to employment and third the right of people with intellectual disabilities to live in their communities. The aim is to show that when placed in conducive conditions, people with intellectual disabilities can not only survive, but thrive, to the benefit of not only themselves and their own betterment, but for the betterment and strengthening of society at large. Levy (2017) discusses the challenges associated with the education of learners with disabilities, citing waiting lists, that special schools have not been declared no-fee schools and the lack of schools in rural areas as important challenges. This is integral and we commend the Department for Basic Education for having done so. Frequently cast to the wind are the chances of a person with an intellectual disability obtaining gainful employment. This can be attributed to aspects such as stigma, low skills levels due to inadequate education, inaccessible and unsupportive work environments, ignorance in society and inadequate access to information. This concept denotes making justifiable allowances for an employee with an illness or a disability who can still fulfil the inherent requirements of their job provided certain adjustments are made. Sometimes people with intellectual disabilities cannot enter into the open labour market or need to learn skills before they can do so. One of the mechanisms through which such individuals can be gainfully employed either permanently or in providing them with requisite skills to move on is through what is known as protective workshops. This gives them a sense of accomplishment and dignity; something of which they would otherwise have been bereft. Institutionalising people with intellectual disabilities is a practice that has existed for millennia. The state and families often place such individuals in settings where they become invisible to society and where they are largely forgotten about. In addition to this, this practice is wholly unnecessary for as has been articulated, many people with intellectual disabilities can flourish within society, carving out meaningful lives for themselves that, as articulated, also benefit others. Deinstitutionalisation, according to Peterson (2004) is “the policy of discharging patients with mental health problems and/or intellectual disability from hospitals so that they can be placed in the community, and the decentralisation of mental health services [that] thus integrates into primary health care.” According to Jacobs (2015) the recovery model refers to a person “staying in control of their lives.” He refers to it as “a process, an outlook, a vision, a conceptual framework or a guiding principle.” He argues that the focus should not be on treatment and management of symptoms, but rather on the building of resilience and providing people with the tools to regain a meaningful life. It highlighted the benefits and described the role of institutions as a back-up. What is important is that such individuals receive the requisite amount of support living in their communities, be it through professional intervention, social welfare or support from peers and loved ones. This had catastrophic outcomes, coming in the form of the Life Esidimeni tragedy in which 144 people lost their lives due to starvation, preventable illness and overall poor care. This represents even worse human rights violations than if the individuals concerned had remained institutionalised and flies completely in the face of what deinstitutionalisation is intended to accomplish. This already renders them more vulnerable than most children and their need for stability is thus increased. The removal of children in this manner is frightening and, reinforces their experience of instability and mistrust of older people who have the power to upend their reality. The NGOs were wholly ill-equipped to care for the patients, resulting in the death of 144 individuals from preventable diseases, starvation and overall poor care. It was as though they were taken on impulse without considering what kind of outcomes awaited the individuals concerned. No heed was paid to the cries of civil society that disastrous results could ensue should the operation be executed. Indeed, it appears that the state has taken no lessons from Life Esidimeni. There still appears to be a perception within the state that reckless behaviour is acceptable and that government can act on impulse, even outside the Constitutional parameters and those established by enabling legislation. We presume neither innocence nor guilt on the part of the Children’s Homes. The question arises how many disastrous events have to ensue before the state learns its lesson? How many people have to suffer before government officials see the error of their ways? While mental health is certainly an unrecognized and neglected focus area, we note efforts to bring to light the failures in the system. Those with severe mental illnesses are more likely to experience some of the most severe health inequalities. Inequalities in mental health and the dilapidated state of psychiatric facilities have significant ethical implication which involve key bioethics principles of medicine and public health that involves: respect for individuals, justice (equality and fairness), promotion of good, and to do no harm. At this level, world leaders have committed to recognise prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases, of which mental, neurological and substance use disorders are included, as health priorities within global development. There can be no sustainable development without mental health and none of the Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved without prioritising mental health. This is so because dignity is a right from which others flow- there is no real right to access to health care without dignity, for example. Other rights similar in nature are the rights to equality and life. This was evidenced with both Life Esidimeni as well as within the status quo. Applied correctly extant legislation and policy could ameliorate the plight of mental health care users, and South Africa could see a high rate of recovery and successful habilitation/rehabilitation. Until horror stories of poor or non-existent basic services subside, until mental health care users are able to obtain what is required in order to maintain a high standard of mental well-being, the drafting of the law, policies and plans concerned will remain a moot and futile expenditure of resources and effort. Many mental health care users are accessing services in the public health care system and are asking themselves “does my life mean as little to Government as the lives of the former Life Esidimeni patients?” The system as it presently stands- despite all of the scrutiny under which it has been placed- represents dereliction of duty on the part of your government and the fact that nobody is being held unaccountable renders the system to a state of wanton neglect. It is greatly desirous that this communication will be addressed with a sense of urgency and that steps will be put in place to remedy the fatal defects in the system. It is an opportunity to engage in activism surrounding the rights of people with disability and to raise awareness surrounding the need for their rights to be realised. While a single day of the year is hardly enough to scratch the surface, it heralds the prospects of making a start in advocating for the rights of people so-situated. People with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities are especially vulnerable as their disabilities are often not well-understood and methods of assisting them are not clearly defined in the minds of the state or society. The state is the primary duty-bearer when it comes to providing the care and support these individuals need both to survive and thrive. Unfortunately however, the state has prolifically and chronically failed people with disabilities, leading to social exclusion and poverty. This was evidenced in the Life Esidimeni tragedy and a spate of deaths and assaults of and by psychiatric patients in hospitals across the country, as well as within the community, as the state did not have adequate structures in place to ensure the safety of these individuals. Stripped of even the slightest bit of dignity, such individuals languished up to a point where crises arose, but by then it was too late and state intervention was meaningless. Unfortunately the prescripts of these instruments remain largely unimplemented, with the effect that people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities remain in limbo, often no better off than what they were before these frameworks came into place. SAFMH maintains that Mahlangu ought to be made to take responsibility for her actions and inactions by the ANC doing more than shuffling her around the ranks of the party. Despite supposed commitment to this process, its execution has largely been a failure. Life Esidimeni amounted to a situation worse than Marikana and on par with incidents such as the Sharpeville Massacre and the Soweto Uprising. The state was warned by professionals, civil society and families that the transfer of the patients would have disastrous results, but the warning was cast to the wind and tragedy ensued. Whilst Life Esidimeni is a poignant example of the state’s failure to take responsibility for mental health care users, it is sadly not the only example. It has been internationally recognised that people with psychosocial disabilities and intellectual disabilities should only be institutionalised as a matter of last resort. This was one of the factors leading to the disastrous violation of human rights in the Life Esidimeni Tragedy, in which 144 mental health care users lost their lives while residing at NGOs. The campaign will be constituted of several activities. It is our intention to paint a comprehensive picture of the situation in which people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities find themselves and also to propose solutions for duty-bearers to consider in their work around such individuals. The goal is to inspire a call to action and to catalyse positive change in the lives of people living with these conditions. It is our hope that our campaign will adequately serve what we view as an extremely important purpose. There is no reason that people in this position should be denied the right to live in their communities and to become accepted and productive members of society. therefore they leave room for more accurate and analytical judgement of the situation. Thus, according to this argument, unlike consequentialist intuitions, emotion-based deontological intuitions are the side effects of this evolutionary adaption to the pre-existing environment. Therefore, “deontological intuitions, unlike consequentialist intuitions, do not have any normative force\". Berker states that this is an incorrect conclusion because there is no reason to think that consequentialist intuitions are not also by-products of evolution. Moreover, he argues that the invitation, advanced by Singer, to separate evolutionary-based moral judgements (allegedly unreliable) from those that are based on reason, is misleading because it is based on a false dichotomy. consideration of the philosophical arguments presented in Singer's book Animal Liberation failed to see the \"radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees.\" Posner emphasizes the importance of facts over arguments in creating social change.

Moreover, Plato's allegory suggests that true knowledge can only be gained by venturing outside the cave and experiencing the world beyond. We may consult medical professionals, research our symptoms, and educate ourselves about our condition in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Aristotle's De anima (On the Soul) divides the mind into three parts: sensation, imagination and intellection. When one perceives an object, his mind composites a sense-image. When he remembers the object he previously sensed, he is imagining its form (the image of the imagination is often translated as \"phantasm\"). When he extracts information from this phantasm, he is using his intellect. Consequently, all human knowledge concerning universals (such as species and properties) are derived from the phantasm (\"the received is in the receiver according to the mode of the receiver\" \n\n After Socrates claims to not know the answer, he uses his Socratic method to ask a number of questions and prompt deeper thinking into the topic. Meno claims that virtue must be different to each person since people have different roles in society so what they must do to uphold those roles will be different. Plato objects to this notion thinking that there must be a commonality to virtue across all people. The two are then led into complex epistemological issues of knowing, learning, and memory.

While it is commonly thought that Darrow \"switched sides\" to represent Debs, a myth repeated by Irving Stone's biography, Clarence Darrow For the Defense, he had in fact resigned from the railroad earlier, after the death of his mentor William Goudy. Clarence Darrow, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by William Jennings Bryan, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school. The Scopes trial was \n\n In 1952, Hollowell set up a law practice in Atlanta, Georgia, where he began to play a major role in the burgeoning civil rights struggle. The suit ended in 1961 with a federal court order demanding the admission of two African-American students, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton E. Holmes. In 1960, Hollowell and co-counsel Horace Ward won a victory in the Georgia Court of Appeals which secured the release of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Georgia State Prison. In another case, Hollowell and members of his firm prevented the execution of a 15-year-old black youth from Monticello, Georgia five days \n\nWhat was the impetus for entering the field of Hospice and Palliative Medicine? It was clearly obvious to me during my medical school years and residency (1980’s) that many patients that were terminally-ill with cancer, AIDS (1980s was the advent of HIV), very debilitated elderly patients and vegetative patients with no chance for quality of life, were being kept alive without treatment of their emotional, spiritual, interpersonal and many times there physical pain. I knew there had to be some way to help these suffering patients die comfortably and with dignity. Since all doctors were busy with patients, I cared for the elderly gentleman who had a better chance of survival. Essentially, when I was caring for terminally ill AIDS and cancer patients in the hospital. At the end, most would rally with incredible energy and would tell their family and friends goodbye and at times describe their visions. After seeing hundred of patients dying, including murderers, Christians, Muslims, Atheists, Jews, and most claiming to see the same apparitions at similar times before their death, I knew there had to be more to the experiences that modern medicine had not been willing to research. When I began my research on PDEs, I found that the quest for facts to support the idea of post-mortem survival w over 2,000 years ago. The most well-known example being the pre-death experience of Jesus of Nazareth. He foresaw His death and resurrection and told of seeing and speaking to angels and deceased prophets, all which appeared to Him so as to help with His transition. Prior to His death and while on nailed to the cross, He left us with knowledge of hoe to live our life’s and how to die and what awaited us. What He explains is similar to the descriptions and messages that many of my patients leave with me. In the book, more is described. What other noted civilizations and people described the pre-death experience? The Egyptians, Sumerians and Plato describe pre-death experiences in their writings. The Romans, a second century Rabbi Yochar wrote about death bed visions in his book entitled The Book of Splendor. Abraham Lincoln told his best friend a dream of his death just days before he was assassinated. A twentieth-century well-known physicist named Sir William Barrett, who worked with the famous physicist Dr. Tindell studied this phenomenon and wrote a book in 1926 entitled Death Bed Visions – 1926. He described visions the dying described just days to hours before their death. These visions included deceased loved one and spiritual beings coming to guide them to the other-side. They are given much information with regards to their life, and close family members so they can make the transition to the next life or heaven as some patients call it. Can you describe the timing of these visions or non-linear conscious awareness? At times, patients claim to see God at the foot of the bed. He was so unselfish and spoke of his three angels he called Gabby, Raphy and Noe. He said they were quite large angels that were there to keep him from feeling pain and to fulfill his purpose for being born. He gave several prophecies about our world and my life. Did patients ever see hell or talk about the devil? Only a few, and most explained it as a self separation from God that comes from not being able to forgive oneself or love oneself as we are ready to transition. How do you propose to improve this lack of knowledge with regards to the process of dying? Dr. Bruce Grayson who is the director of the perceptual studies at the University of Virginia Medical School as well as Dr. Gary Schwartz out of The University of Arizona School of medicine. They are looking at biological markers, as well as EEG’s, pet scans, immunological markers and other brain Neurotransmitters, like dopamine, serotonin, Nor epinephrine and the latest being Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) located in the pineal gland and possibly related directly to the visions. Yet, the nurses as well as I and other physicians somehow are able to get the patients to tell us their visions. Also, if one is on hard narcotics like morphine, which I believe to be necessary for comfort, their minds maybe to relaxed to communicate. My patients have related to me that all humans have the latent ability but not all brains are fully evolved or have the right amount and balance of chemicals to initiate this ability. What do you feel will be the impact of the book’s message five years from now? The core essence of the book is one of Hope and enduring Love for All. Surprisingly, judgment does not play a big role in this message. You can speak of dying patients who have done ill will in their lives that they would be the ones judging themselves as told by many of my patients. So, self forgiveness and self love is so important. If we all do not try to help in some way, evolution and direct affects of mans actions on each other and our earth will take care of it sooner or later. I believe that humanity as a whole has reached the “fork in the road”, if you will. I believe that is why the book has been embraced by so many. I am just a simple witness to their testament. I believe there is a much Higher Purpose than I can ever imagine to these messages. What would you tell someone who is thinking of ending their life prematurely? I have had a few patients which have survived suicide and eventually changed their lives as a result of the spiritual visions they had. I too was skeptical and to this day have to remain quite objective and impassive, yet with a human caring heart, as patient’s lives hinge on my diagnosis and palliative treatment. Why do you feel the book has been embraced by so many? I have to admit I have not experienced a book and its message which has touched so many people at such a deep level whether they are religious or non-religious regardless of their race and creed. God knew that they were extremely depressed and that their brain chemistry was such that it felt leaving this world was the only option. They said that the angels told them that humans were wrong to condemnthem as the pain they were suffering was horrific. As far as what a few patients have told me is that some of us have the ability at this time and that as our brain evolves and we open our minds to this possibility thru meditation and prayer and so on….. we all will be able to have the ability. They told me this is beginning to happen as we speak and will occur with intensified frequency after 4 more years. I am writing about his very question in my 2nd book. I have attended 4 deaths. None of them acknowledged any of the entities that you suggest. Most visions last 3 to 4 seconds and discussion of those experiences usually ensues immediately after. Also, if one is on hard narcotics like morphine, which I believe to be necessary for comfort, their minds maybe to relaxed to communicate. I always wondered about forgiveness because thebible says to forgive and also because mediums say spirits have difficulties inthe afterlife when there is unfinished business. I have seen several people die who could not find it within themselves to find self forgiveness or self love as they had lived a life full of deceit, lies, hatred, vengeance, abuse, drug use….much of it ,if not all, stemming from family genetics. They would claim to see dark figures that would frighten them and remind them of all the darkness they had not only brought to themselves but to the world. Most of those patients did not listen to the angels as they did not feel worthy to forgive themselves and thus they chose to be separated 20from God. Many described going into an abyss or a cave that was full of other people who were murderers, abusers, leaders of countries that massacred people i.e., the Romans, Germans. It was horrifying to watch.I learned the only way to help these souls was to pray for them and to witness to them about Gods unconditional love and forgiveness. Over a period of time, many would find their way out and move towards the light at which point they would learn how to forgive and love.That is why it is so important to pray for those souls who have died and not close to God. I was told in order to move up the ladder of knowledge, if you will, is to learn to pray for others hat may have hurt you deeply. Is it common for patients to die without claiming to see spiritual entities? One example was a lawyer who had lost his son a year earlier and was quite worried because he had not seen angels or any other kind of spiritual being just one day before he died. At one hour before he died he finally saw his son and smiled and died. I truly believe that the brain needs to be functioning somewhat well in order to have visions with our physical eyes. He definitelydid not have enough blood moving towards his brains and thus eyes therefore, he saw blackness. How does one go about forgiving oneself before dying? I do not have the exact recipe, but I can tell you what my patients tell me: In their opinion, to forgive oneself, one must LIKE oneself….. And for the most part, most people do not like themselves. That is why they seek to always be connected to someone…because they cannot stand to live with the one person they don’t like themselves. Therefore, exercise, eat fairly well, go have fun, and make time to talk to God and help others, i.e. Scopes was charged on May 5, 1925 with teaching evolution from a chapter in a textbook which showed ideas developed from those set out in Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species.

Deontologists believe that ethical rules bind individuals to their duty or obligation. Consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, evaluate the rightness or wrongness of an action based on its outcomes and aim to maximize overall happiness or utility. Teleological theories also consider the end goal or purpose of an action in assessing its morality. While some deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that certain actions are always wrong regardless of their consequences, others recognize that circumstances may influence the morality of an action. For example, Immanuel Kant argued that lying is always wrong, even if it means protecting someone from harm. Ross proposed a more flexible deontological theory where the consequences can sometimes override certain duties. Overall, deontological ethics focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves and emphasizes fulfilling one's duty or obligation, while consequentialist and teleological ethical theories consider the outcomes and purposes of actions in determining their morality. Reference:\n- Deontological Ethics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n\nWhen determining the moral implications of actions such as murder, abortion, contraception, greenhouse gas emissions, and the deprivation of non-discernible and non-existent people, several factors should be considered. Secondly, the intentions and motivations behind these actions should be taken into account. In conclusion, when determining the moral implications of actions such as murder, abortion, contraception, greenhouse gas emissions, and the deprivation of non-discernible and non-existent people, factors such as the nature and value of life, intentions and motivations, consequences and impact, and the broader ethical context should all be carefully considered. Acts can't be predicted by knowledge of motives alone. ; Empirical – The character of other people or oneself can only be known through experience. Only by seeing actual behavior in a situation can character be known. Are two actions possible to a given person under given circumstances? To wish that some event \n\nDeontological ethics or deontology (Greek: δέον (deon) meaning 'obligation' or 'duty') is an approach to ethics that focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, as opposed to the rightness or wrongness of the consequences of those actions. It is sometimes described as \"duty\" or \"obligation\" based ethics, because deontologists believe that ethical rules \"bind you to your duty\". The term 'deontological' was first used in this way in 1930, in C. D. Broad's book, Five Types of Ethical Theory. Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted with consequentialist or teleological ethical theories, according to which the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences. However, it is also important to note that there is a difference between deontological ethics and moral absolutism. Deontologists who are also moral absolutists believe that some actions are wrong no matter what consequences follow from them. Immanuel Kant, for example, famously argued that it is always wrong to lie – even if a murderer is asking for the location of a potential victim. Ross, hold that the consequences of an action such as lying may sometimes make lying the right thing to do. Kant's and Ross's theories are discussed in more detail below.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about philosophy. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
