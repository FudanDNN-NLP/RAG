Thus in some contexts it may be a form of begging the question, and it is also a special case of ad lapidem. Appeal to ridicule (also called appeal to mockery, ab absurdo, or the horse laugh ) is an informal fallacy which presents an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worthy of serious consideration. Appeal to ridicule is often found in the form of comparing a nuanced circumstance or argument to a laughably commonplace occurrence or to some other irrelevancy on the basis of comedic timing, wordplay, or making an opponent and their argument the object of a joke. This is a rhetorical tactic that mocks an opponent's argument or standpoint, attempting to inspire an emotional reaction (making it a type of appeal to emotion) in the audience and to highlight any counter-intuitive aspects of that argument, making it appear foolish and contrary to common sense. This is typically done by making a mockery of the argument's foundation that represents it in an uncharitable and oversimplified way. An example of an appeal to ridicule:\n\n \"\"God visited me in a dream today and for something to visit me, it must exist - therefore God exists.\"\" The validity of the premise cannot be deduced, as it is anecdotal. This is an example of the hasty generalisation fallacy working with an argument from anecdote. Ad hominem, short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments, some but not all of which are fallacious. The most common form of ad hominem is \"A makes a claim x, B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument x is wrong\". Fallacious ad hominem reasoning occur in formal logic where the validity of an argument based on syllogism or deduction is independent of the person putting it forward.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies.

If one accepts the principle of fallibilism then one also has to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section, source criticism is intimately linked to scientific methods. The presence of fallacies of argument in sources is another kind of philosophical criterion for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the ad hominem fallacy (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the straw man fallacy (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) One's personal beliefs or politics do not interfere with the pursuit of truth; ; Relevant facts and information are not purposefully omitted even when such things may contradict one's hypothesis; ; Facts are presented in an unbiased manner, and not twisted to give misleading impressions or to support one view over another; ; References, or earlier work, are acknowledged where possible, and plagiarism is avoided. Intentionally committed fallacies in debates and reasoning are called intellectual dishonesty. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. In psychoanalysis the concept of defence mechanism is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources. Circumstantial ad hominem is an attack on the bias of a source. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim. Circumstantial ad hominem arguments are not necessarily fallacious. They can be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid (this overlaps with the genetic fallacy – an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). They can also be sound arguments if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B), making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, for example, B speaks from their position as an authority figure. Appeal to tradition: This fallacy assumes that something is effective or true simply because it has been done or believed for a long time. Bandwagon effect: People tend to adopt beliefs or behaviors because many others do, often disregarding evidence or critical thinking.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Of course any assumption can be questioned, \n\nClaude Robert Cloninger (born April 4, 1944) is an American psychiatrist and geneticist noted for his research on the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual foundation of both mental health and mental illness. He identified and described heritable personality traits predictive of vulnerability to alcoholism and other mental disorders in prospective studies of adoptees reared apart from their biological parents. Cloninger also carried out the first genome-wide association and linkage study of normal personality traits, and has developed two widely used tools for measuring personality: the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). He has served in an editorial capacity on many journals, including Behavior Genetics, American Journal of Human Genetics, Archives of General Psychiatry, Comprehensive Psychiatry, and the Mens Sana Monographs. Cloninger wanted to understand why antisocial personality disorder, substance dependence, and somatization disorder were so often found together in the same individual and in the same family. In order to better quantify and test hypotheses about the inheritance of psychiatric disorders, he studied quantitative genetics with Theodore Reich in St. Louis and with Newton Morton and D.C. Rao of the Population Genetics Lab of the University of Hawaii. During the late 70s, Cloninger worked on modeling complex patterns of inheritance using path analysis to allow for both genetic and cultural inheritance. He extended path analysis with the introduction of the \"copath\" to facilitate the analysis of assortative mating and cultural inheritance. As a result, he shifted his efforts after 1980 to more compelling experimental designs, such as adoption and linkage studies. Cloninger developed methods for what he called a \"cross-fostering\" analysis. Information about their rearing environment was measured by data about their adoptive parents and home environment. This permitted study of the independent contributions of the genetic and environmental backgrounds independently and in combination in a sample of thousands of adoptees. Their first joint paper on a cross-fostering analysis of the inheritance of alcoholism in men became an ISI Science Citation Classic that convinced most scientists that vulnerability to alcoholism was genetically heritable in part. Cloninger proposed that the differences between these two groups of people were explained by personality traits that were observable in childhood, long before any exposure to alcohol. Temperament and character inventory\n\nObservations about personality provided Cloninger a practical way to predict vulnerability to mental disorders. He focused on the structure of learning abilities within the person, as has long been desired by social-cognitive psychologists. To test the adequacy of his structural model, Cloninger compared his model of development within the individual (i.e., ontogeny) to the evolution of learning abilities in animal phylogeny. Initially he described three dimensions of temperament that he suggested were independently inherited: harm avoidance (anxious, pessimistic vs. outgoing, optimistic), novelty seeking (impulsive, quick-tempered vs. rigid, slow-tempered) and reward dependence (warm, approval-seeking vs. cold, aloof). These dimensions are measured by using his Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Studies quickly showed that Persistence (persevering, ambitious vs. easily discouraged, underachieving) was a fourth independently-inherited temperament dimension with specific brain circuitry, rather than a facet of Reward Dependence. Cloninger was initially criticized for reducing personality to emotional drives. For example, in his book Listening to Prozac, Peter Kramer called the temperament model of personality \"a humanist's nightmare\". Likewise, Cloninger and his colleague Dragan Svrakic found that temperament alone did not capture the full range of personality. They found that, by itself, temperament could not reveal whether a person was mature or had a personality disorder. Consequently, Cloninger identified a second domain of personality variables, using character traits to measure a person's humanistic and transpersonal style: self-directedness (reliable, purposeful vs. blaming, aimless), cooperativeness (tolerant, helpful vs. prejudiced, revengeful) and self-transcendence (self-forgetful, spiritual vs. self-conscious, materialistic). These character dimensions measure the components of an individual's mental self-government and can strongly measure the presence and severity of personality disorder. Cloninger often cites Immanuel Kant, who defines character as \"what people make of themselves intentionally\". Character dimensions have strong relations with recently evolved regions of the brain—such as the frontal, temporal, and parietal neocortex—that regulate learning of facts and propositions. By contrast, the temperament dimensions have strong relations with the older cortico-striatal and limbic systems that regulate habits and skills. Each dimension is influenced by complex interaction between many genetic and environmental variables, so personality develops as a complex adaptive system. Cloninger's temperament and character inventories have been extensively used in a wide variety of clinical and research purposes, and cited in thousands of peer-reviewed publications. The construction of the inventories on the basis of genetic and neurobiological considerations challenges the traditional statistical assumptions of factor analytically derived inventories, which have been targeted by social and cognitive psychologists for many years. Fortunately, in terms of overall statistical information, there is extensive overlap among the TCI and other multidimensional personality inventories, except that other inventories lack the dimension of Self-Transcendence. According to Cloninger's model, self-transcendence can manifest as an intuitive understanding of elevated aspects of humanity, like compassion, ethics, art, and culture. People scoring high in TCI Self-Transcendence report frequent experiences of boundlessness and inseparability. Cloninger observes that such experiences of self-forgetfulness and transpersonal identification correspond to what Freud called \"oceanic feelings\", which is different from intellectual adherence to particular religious dogmas or rituals. Cloninger proposed that the psyche is the aspect of a human being that motivates the search for self-transcendence and underlies the human capacities for self-awareness, creativity, and freedom of will. He found that when people who score high on all three character traits are compared to others, they have the highest level of well-being, as measured by presence of positive emotions, absence of negative emotions, satisfaction with life, or virtuous conduct. The capacity for love and work have long been recognized as important for well-being, but Cloninger also observed that people need to experience self-transcendence in order to cope well with suffering and to enjoy life's wonders and mysteries fully. In order for us to advance systematically, as for instance chemistry and physics have done, we need a specific theory of the person and our nature of being. As a result of that I have tried to work out such a systematic model, and have progressed by stages to more and more inclusive theoretical frameworks. Each of these has to be carefully defined and measurable, so that we can avoid fantasy and speculation and have testable models. ... What has become increasingly clear to me is that man has a natural integrative tendency that leads to health, and that disease emerges whenever there is a block. Blocks can come from a genetic predisposition that interferes with natural development, from social learning, or from prior experiences that are unique to the individual. Cloninger has also suggested that not only is there a natural integrative tendency, but that \"all human beings have spontaneous needs for happiness, self-understanding and love.\" He describes practices that improve character development and satisfy these strong basic needs. He describes examples of such exercises in detail in a DVD series called Know Yourself, which was developed with the Anthropedia Foundation. The mental exercises described by Cloninger are intended to stimulate character development and self-awareness, thereby fostering a healthy way of living with three sets of goals and values:\n\nWorking in the service of others, thereby increasing love and cooperativeness; letting go of fighting and worrying, thereby increasing hope and self-directedness; and growing in awareness, thereby increasing faith and Self-Transcendence. Cloninger's approach combines principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and positive psychology with personality assessment and meditative practices that enhance mindfulness and self-awareness of the cognitive schemas that organize and direct our attention and motivation in different situations. He suggests that the separation of biomedical, psychosocial, and spiritual approaches interferes with the development of well-being, whereas their integration has been shown to reduce drop-out, relapse, and recurrence rates in randomized controlled trials of well-being therapy. The American Psychiatric Association has recognized Cloninger for his contributions to better understanding the biopsychosocial basis of mental health and illness with its 2009 Judd Marmor Award.

Cloninger's temperament and character inventories have been extensively used in a wide variety of clinical and research purposes, and cited in thousands of peer-reviewed publications. The construction of the inventories on the basis of genetic and neurobiological considerations challenges the traditional statistical assumptions of factor analytically derived inventories, which have been targeted by social and cognitive psychologists for many years. Fortunately, in terms of overall statistical information, there is extensive overlap among the TCI and other multidimensional personality inventories, except that other inventories lack the dimension of Self-Transcendence. According to Cloninger's model, self-transcendence can manifest as an intuitive understanding of elevated aspects of humanity, like compassion, ethics, art, and culture. People scoring high in TCI Self-Transcendence report frequent experiences of boundlessness and inseparability. Cloninger observes that such experiences of self-forgetfulness and transpersonal identification correspond to what Freud called \"oceanic feelings\", which is different from intellectual adherence to particular religious dogmas or rituals. Cloninger proposed that the psyche is the aspect of a human being that motivates the search for self-transcendence and underlies the human capacities for self-awareness, creativity, and freedom of will. He found that when people who score high on all three character traits are compared to others, they have the highest level of well-being, as measured by presence of positive emotions, absence of negative emotions, satisfaction with life, or virtuous conduct. The capacity for love and work have long been recognized as important for well-being, but Cloninger also observed that people need to experience self-transcendence in order to cope well with suffering and to enjoy life's wonders and mysteries fully. In order for us to advance systematically, as for instance chemistry and physics have done, we need a specific theory of the person and our nature of being. As a result of that I have tried to work out such a systematic model, and have progressed by stages to more and more inclusive theoretical frameworks. Each of these has to be carefully defined and measurable, so that we can avoid fantasy and speculation and have testable models. ... What has become increasingly clear to me is that man has a natural integrative tendency that leads to health, and that disease emerges whenever there is a block. Blocks can come from a genetic predisposition that interferes with natural development, from social learning, or from prior experiences that are unique to the individual. Cloninger has also suggested that not only is there a natural integrative tendency, but that \"all human beings have spontaneous needs for happiness, self-understanding and love.\" He describes practices that improve character development and satisfy these strong basic needs. He describes examples of such exercises in detail in a DVD series called Know Yourself, which was developed with the Anthropedia Foundation. The mental exercises described by Cloninger are intended to stimulate character development and self-awareness, thereby fostering a healthy way of living with three sets of goals and values:\n\nWorking in the service of others, thereby increasing love and cooperativeness; letting go of fighting and worrying, thereby increasing hope and self-directedness; and growing in awareness, thereby increasing faith and Self-Transcendence. Cloninger's approach combines principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and positive psychology with personality assessment and meditative practices that enhance mindfulness and self-awareness of the cognitive schemas that organize and direct our attention and motivation in different situations. He suggests that the separation of biomedical, psychosocial, and spiritual approaches interferes with the development of well-being, whereas their integration has been shown to reduce drop-out, relapse, and recurrence rates in randomized controlled trials of well-being therapy. The American Psychiatric Association has recognized Cloninger for his contributions to better understanding the biopsychosocial basis of mental health and illness with its 2009 Judd Marmor Award.

Circumstantial ad hominem arguments are not necessarily fallacious. Unlike ordinary fallacy fallacies, which reason from an argument's fallaciousness to its conclusion's falsehood, the kind of argument Lycan has in mind treats another argument's fallaciousness as obvious without first demonstrating that any fallacy at all is present. Guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ad hominem fallacy, if the argument attacks a person because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument. This form of the argument is as follows: An example of this fallacy would be \"My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Ad hominem fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help create a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish. An ad hominem attack is an attack on the character of the target, who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself or herself from the accusation of being hypocritical. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, ad hominem attacks have erroneously been assumed to always be fallacious. The first is the precedent ad hominem, according to which the previous history of someone means that they are not fit for the office. The second one is a behavioral ad hominem: \"My opponent was not decent in his arguments in the past, so now he is not either\". Ad hominem, short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments, some but not all of which are fallacious. The most common form of ad hominem is \"A makes a claim x, B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument x is wrong\". Fallacious ad hominem reasoning occur in formal logic where the validity of an argument based on syllogism or deduction is independent of the person putting it forward.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies.

Therefore, the term formal fallacy is preferred. Premise: A is a B ; Premise: A is also a C ; Conclusion: Therefore, all Bs are Cs  In notation of first-order logic, this type of fallacy can be expressed as (∃x ∈ S : φ(x)) ⇒ (∀x ∈ S : φ(x)), meaning \"if there exists any x in the set S so that a property φ is true for x, then for all x in S the property φ must be true.\" The fallacy in the argument can be illustrated through the use of an Euler diagram: \"A\" satisfies the requirement that it is part of both sets \"B\" and \"C\", but if one represents this as an Euler diagram, it can clearly be seen that it is possible that a part of set \"B\" is not part of set \"C\", refuting the conclusion that \"all Bs are Cs\". Argumentum ad logicam can be used as an ad hominem appeal: by impugning the opponent's credibility or good faith, it can be used to sway the audience by undermining the speaker rather than by addressing the speaker's argument.

It has the general argument form: Thus, it is a special case of denying the antecedent where the antecedent, rather than being a proposition that is false, is an entire argument that is fallacious. But showing how one argument in a complex thesis is fallaciously reasoned does not necessarily invalidate its conclusion if that conclusion is not dependent on the fallacy. Whilst this argument is logically valid - as, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true; it may not be logically sound. The validity of the premise cannot be deduced, as it is anecdotal. This is an example of the hasty generalisation fallacy working with an argument from anecdote. the burden of persuasion are referred to as \"burdens of proof.\" For example, if a person charged with murder pleads self-defence, the defendant must satisfy the evidential burden that there is some evidence suggesting self-defence.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies.

Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze both social and personal human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. They further state that by categorizing a behavior as \"natural\" and \"biological\" they do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. But to infer from that, as many critics assert that Thornhill and Palmer do, that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so-called naturalistic fallacy. The fact–value distinction is also closely related to the moralistic fallacy, an invalid inference of factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises. For example, an invalid inference \"Because everybody ought to be equal, there are no innate genetic differences between people\" is an instance of the moralistic fallacy. As for the naturalistic fallacy one attempts to move from an \"is\" to an \"ought\" statement, with the moralistic fallacy one attempts to move from an \"ought\" to an \"is\" statement. (2003) argue that evolutionary psychologists like Thornhill and Palmer use the naturalistic fallacy inappropriately to forestall legitimate discussion about the ethical implications of their theory. According to Thornhill and Palmer, a naturalistic fallacy is to infer ethical conclusions (e.g., rape is good) from (true or false) statements of fact (e.g., rape is natural).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies.

This sequence of events means that United States punished Stephen Funk for refusing to \"report to his unit during [a] war\" not sanctioned by the United Nations. This fact has major implications in international law: In an interview given on August 25, 2006, about the \"2003 invasion of Iraq,...[ Benjamin B. Ferencz, an American lawyer ],...said the United Nations charter, which was written after the carnage of World War II, contains a provision that no \n\n The federal structure of some nations, such as the United States, can pose particular problems with respect to extraditions when the police power and the power of foreign relations are held at different levels of the federal hierarchy. For instance, in the United States, most criminal prosecutions occur at the state level, and most foreign relations occurs on the federal level. As a result, a state that wishes to prosecute an individual located in foreign territory must direct its extradition request \n\n in 1862 and its defeat in the Second Mexican War (1881–1882), the United States adopts a 'Remembrance' foreign policy against the Confederacy, Great Britain and France (similar to revanchism) and allies itself with the German Empire and later the Central Powers. Although citizens and nationals make up the majority of Americans, many dual citizens, expatriates and permanent residents could also legally claim American nationality. As a result, American culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity, but with bona fide citizenship and an oath of permanent allegiance. It exercises no direct rule anywhere outside these areas, and it has always attempted to extricate itself as swiftly as possible from anything that looks as if it were about to develop into even in direct rule.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies.

Other names for the fallacy include common belief fallacy or appeal to (common) belief, appeal to the majority, appeal to the masses, appeal to popularity, argument from consensus, authority of the many, bandwagon fallacy, consensus gentium (Latin for \"agreement of the people\"), democratic fallacy, mob appeal, and truth by association. Argumentum ad populum is a type of informal fallacy, specifically a fallacy of relevance, and is similar to an argument from authority (argumentum ad verecundiam). The fallacy is similar \n\n Appeal to ridicule (also called appeal to mockery, ab absurdo, or the horse laugh ) is an informal fallacy which presents an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worthy of serious consideration. This is a rhetorical tactic that mocks an opponent's argument or standpoint, attempting to inspire an emotional reaction (making it a type of appeal to emotion) in the audience and to highlight any counter-intuitive aspects of that argument, making it appear foolish and contrary to common sense. This is typically done by making a mockery of the argument's foundation that represents it in an uncharitable and oversimplified way. An example of an appeal to ridicule:\n\n Argumentum ad logicam can be used as an ad hominem appeal: by impugning the opponent's credibility or good faith, it can be used to sway the audience by undermining the speaker rather than by addressing the speaker's argument. Unlike ordinary fallacy fallacies, which reason from an argument's fallaciousness to its conclusion's falsehood, the kind of argument Lycan has in mind treats another argument's fallaciousness as obvious without first demonstrating that any fallacy at all is present. Thus in some contexts it may be a form of begging the question, and it is also a special case of ad lapidem.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about logical fallacies.
