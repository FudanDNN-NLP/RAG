For the purpose of exposition, we give an example physical problem and the accompanying boundary value problem (BVP). Even if the reader is unfamiliar with the notation, the purpose is merely to show what a BVP looks like when written down. This particular problem can be solved exactly on paper, so there is no need for a computer. However, this is an exceptional case, and most BVPs cannot be solved exactly. The only possibility is to use a computer to find an approximate solution. Consider the system of equations  The coefficient matrix is  In this example the coefficient matrix has rank 2, while the augmented matrix has rank 3; so this system of equations has no solution. Indeed, an increase in the number of linearly independent columns has made the system of equations inconsistent. In this example we pretend that we only know the following properties of the exponential function: {{NumBlk|:| For instance, this approximation provides a decimal expression e ≈ 2.71828, correct up to five decimal places.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

The additive inverse −f of f in M(G) coincides with the natural pointwise definition, that is, (−f)(x) = −(f(x)) for all x in G. If G has at least 2 elements, M(G) is not a ring, even if G is abelian. However, there is a subset E(G) of M(G) consisting of all group endomorphisms of G, \n\nIn set theory, an arbitrary permutation of the elements of a set X is an automorphism.

For example, the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group. Therefore the sequence is exact if and only if the rightmost map (from A to B) has kernel {0}; that is, if and only if that map is a monomorphism (injective, or one-to-one). The kernel of the rightmost map is C. Therefore the sequence is exact if and only if the image of the leftmost map (from B to C) is all of C; that is, if and only if that map is an epimorphism (surjective, or onto). ; Therefore, the sequence 0 → X → Y → 0 is exact if and only if the map from X to Y is both a monomorphism and epimorphism (that is, a bimorphism), and thus, in many cases, an isomorphism from X to Y. To understand the definition, it is helpful to consider relatively simple cases where the sequence is finite and begins or ends with the trivial group.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

Now one proves by induction on the leading monomial in lexicographic order, that any nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial P of degree d can be written as polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials.

The Conway polynomial Cp,n is defined as the lexicographically minimal monic primitive polynomial of degree n over Fp that is compatible with Cp,m for all m dividing n. This is an inductive definition on n: the base case is Cp,1(x) = x − α where α is the lexicographically minimal primitive element of Fp. The notion of lexicographical ordering used is the following: Since there does not appear to be any natural mathematical criterion that would single out one monic primitive polynomial satisfying the compatibility conditions over all the others, the imposition of lexicographical ordering in the definition of the Conway polynomial should be regarded as a convention.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the shortest path is not immediately clear. These paths are called geodesics, and one of the most fundamental problems in the calculus of variations is finding geodesics. No such function exists around point B, where the tangent space is vertical.]] In a less technical language, implicit functions exist and can be differentiated, if the curve has a non-vertical tangent. To see that it is the closest point to the origin on the plane, observe that is the closest point becomes an immediate consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. In analytic geometry, any equation involving the coordinates specifies a subset of the plane, namely the solution set for the equation, or locus. In general, linear equations involving x and y specify lines, quadratic equations specify conic sections, and more complicated equations describe more complicated figures. Usually, a single equation corresponds to a curve on the plane. In three dimensions, a single equation usually gives a surface, and a curve must be specified as the intersection of two surfaces (see below), or as a system of parametric equations. The equation x2 + y2 = r2 is the equation for any circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius of r.\n\n The following construction was given by Isaac Newton. To see this, let the distance between B and J be 2a. Note that, as with the double projection construction, this can be adapted to produce a mechanical device that generates the curve.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

So I is a ring with unity, and a \"subring-without-unity\", but not a \"subring-with-unity\" of Z × Z. ; The proper ideals of Z have no multiplicative identity. Proper ideals are subrings (without unity) that are closed under both left and right multiplication by elements of R. If one omits the requirement that rings have a unity element, then subrings need only be non-empty and otherwise conform to the ring structure, and ideals become subrings. Ideals may or may not have their own multiplicative identity (distinct from the identity of the ring): If I is a prime ideal of a commutative ring R, then the intersection of I with any subring S of R remains prime in S. In this case one says that I lies over I ∩ S. The situation is more complicated when R is not commutative. X with zero constant term can be divided indefinitely by noninvertible elements of R, which are still noninvertible in S, and the ideal generated by all these quotients of is not finitely generated (and so X has no factorization in S). ; It suffices to prove that for every pair a, b in S there exist s, t in S such that as + bt divides both a and b. ; If a and b have a common divisor d, it suffices to prove this for a/d and b/d, since \n\n constant d is a common divisor in S of a and b; we shall show it is in fact a greatest common divisor by showing that it lies in aS + bS. r1 = r is an element of the ideal, and so the ideal is equal to R.) So, if I were equal to R, then it would contain 1, and that means one of the members of T would contain 1 and would thus be equal to R – but R is explicitly excluded from P. The hypothesis of Zorn's lemma has been checked, and thus there is a maximal element in P, in other words a maximal ideal in R. The proof depends on the fact that the ring R has a multiplicative unit 1. As a consequence of the third point, if a and b are coprime and br &equiv; bs (mod a), then r &equiv; s (mod a).\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about college mathematics.

It may also be found within a regular icosahedron of side length c: the shortest line segment from any vertex V to the plane of its five neighbors has length a, and the endpoints of this line segment together with any of the neighbors of V form the vertices of a right triangle with sides a, b, and c.\n\n In any triangle, any vertex and the point where the opposite excircle touches the triangle partition the triangle's perimeter into two equal lengths, thus creating two paths each of which has a length equal to the semiperimeter.

If p(v) and p(w) are two different points of P(V) , the vectors v and w are linearly independent. It follows that: P(V) and P(V) is a projective subspace if and only if, given any two different points, it contains the whole projective line passing through these points. In synthetic geometry, where projective lines are primitive objects, the first property is an axiom, and the second one is the definition of a projective subspace. The matrix corresponding to this bilinear form (see below) on a standard basis is the identity matrix. Let V be any vector space (including possibly infinite-dimensional), and assume T is a linear function from V to the field. Let V be the vector space of continuous single-variable real functions. The theorem states that every ergodic flow is isomorphic to a special flow corresponding to a ceiling function with ergodic base transformation. For simplicity only the original result of is considered, the case of an ergodic flow preserving a probability measure μ . Since the flow is conservative, for any projection p ≠ 0, 1 in A there is a T > 0 without σT(p) ≤ p, so that (1 − p) ∧ σT(p) ≠ 0 .
